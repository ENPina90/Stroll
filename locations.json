"introText": "<p>Freedom &ndash; no other feeling drives the people of Berlin more strongly than their desire for independence and&nbsp; their struggles for equality. Whether it&rsquo;s Dada or the Horseshoe Estate, the Air Lift or the Mauerpark, the pursuit of freedom and self-determination not only drives this city but provides its inner compass.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>The traces of this ongoing battle are buried deep in the city&rsquo;s foundations. Memories are embedded in its walls and pavements, and every street corner has a story to tell &ndash; tales of people building barricades and occupying houses. Tales of people who fight for freedom, of those who grab it with both hands and those who seek to burn and destroy. Tales of people who take a stand, push the boundaries and tear down walls.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This app is a compilation of more than 200 of these tales, telling stories of radicals and revolutionaries, dictators and dissidents, communards and coffee shop bohemians, anti-war activists and cold warriors, lido-goers and street artists.&nbsp; It delves into the city&rsquo;s open-air and underground scene, its jazz clubs and gay culture. It peers into the city&rsquo;s backyards, squats and consumer palaces and gazes at its grandiose socialist architecture. All of this makes Berlin what it is. There&rsquo;s so much to tell. About Berlin.</p>\r\n",

This was where the tram, tube and horse-drawn omnibus met, a focal point for people from across the world on their way to the nearby Export District.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>Over the last years, Moritzplatz has changed almost more dramatically than any other part of Berlin. At the end of the Second World War, the square was left almost in ruins. When the city was divided, Moritzplatz was directly at the Heinrich-Heine-Stra&szlig;e border crossing on the very margins of West Berlin. Since 2012, almost unnoticed, Berlin&rsquo;s new building boom has changed the face of Moritzplatz. There is little left of the square&rsquo;s glamour and extravagance in the 1920s. Yet individual elements can be recombined into a picture telling us a lot about today&#39;s development and, in particular, about the location&rsquo;s special attraction.</p>\r\n",

In Berlin, a day to remember &ndash; not only to commemorate winning the war, but also its part in founding the German Empire. Today, in the presence of Emperor Wilhelm I, the Victory Column is ceremonially unveiled &ndash; a memorial he commissioned in 1864 as the then King of Prussia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Celebrations at a different site</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be present at this unveiling of the Victory Column in 1873, you&rsquo;d have to be just over 1.5 km away to the north east. When first built, the column stood on K&ouml;nigsplatz square, a former army exercise ground, today&rsquo;s Platz der Republik. On K&ouml;nigsplatz square, the monument, nearly 60 meters high, is framed by the Kroll Opera House and Count Raczyński&rsquo;s luxurious town mansion &ndash; a few years later, the site of the Reichstag Parliament building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally, the column&rsquo;s crowning statue of the goddess of victory, a symbol of Prussia&rsquo;s striving for power, has a view across the later Siegesallee, a broad boulevard linking K&ouml;nigsplatz, close to the Reichstag, and Kemperplatz, near Potsdamer Platz. The column&rsquo;s then three blocks of sandstone are decorated with gilded canon barrels captured as war booty. Just like the base with its bronze reliefs and the mosaic frieze in the columned entrance, they recall the three Wars of German Unification. Between 1864 and 1871, Prussian forces are victorious in the Danish-Prussian War, the Austro-Prussian War and the Franco-Prussian War &ndash; successes resulting in Wilhelm I, King of Prussia, being proclaimed German Emperor in 1871 in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Where the cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me meets</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new Victory Column&rsquo;s unveiling ceremony offers a perfect insight into Prussian court etiquette, which follows a military hierarchy. Dressed in his full regalia and on horseback, Prince Otto von Bismarck, the Iron Chancellor, gives the command to unveil the monument. Meanwhile, the official guests are gathered in three separate groups. First, the imperial and royal court in a festive pavilion facing the Victory Column; then, on their own dedicated stand, the army generals and the rulers of the principalities and states who fought alongside Prussia in the Wars of German Unification. Finally, at a suitable distance, representatives of the Reichstag and the city of Berlin &ndash; including the liberal mayor of the city. The common people are free to celebrate the new Victory Column as they wish at another location in the evening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the third anniversary of the Battle of Sedan, the Victory Column stands on the same site for another 65 years &ndash; until the Nazi regime decrees that the memorial is in the way of their planned world capital Germania. In 1938, Albert Speer, Hitler&rsquo;s main architect, has the column moved to where you can now look up and see the golden goddess of victory.</p>\r\n",

This fast-growing industrial city can&rsquo;t cope with the tens of thousands who are leaving their villages and flooding into the capital in search of work and a better life.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>Destitution stalks the streets of Berlin. Homeless people can be seen begging on every street corner. The journalist and writer Constantin Liebich, a member of the Protestant Church of Reconciliation, decides he has to do something. He gives a talk to members of a local protestant youth group in which he exhorts his audience to display some &ldquo;active, Christian charity&rdquo;. <sup>1</sup> By the end of the event, he has recruited five volunteers and collected a whole 9 marks in donations. It may not be much,but Liebich and his helpers use this money and their boundless enthusiasm to organise morning prayer services followed by breakfast. On 22 October 1882, 25 homeless people turn up at Oranienstra&szlig;e 19 for the first service. Before long their numbers have swelled to 600.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a temporary move to the F&uuml;rst Bl&uuml;cher clubhouse on Weddingplatz, Liebich and his newly-formed association called <em>Dienst am Arbeitslosen </em>(<em>Help for the Unemployed</em>) set up shop at Ackerstra&szlig;e 52, just 100 metres away on the other side of the street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Berlin&#39;s first social workers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two bread rolls, a cup of coffee and a church service are now the Sunday ritual. Locals soon start referring to it as the <em>Schrippenkirche </em>&ndash; the bread roll church. But Liebich feels he needs to do more than just feed the poor, though this continues to this day. The homeless need housing, the unemployed need jobs. Liebich decides to fight for these things too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1902, he opens a centre for young homeless people at the association&rsquo;s clubhouse. This is in addition to the Schrippenkirche, which is now regularly feeding 1,000 people every week. Now young people also have somewhere to go to get warm. Liebich&#39;s goal is to &ldquo;help people help themselves&rdquo;. The association sets up its own employment agency and leads by example &ndash; it takes on many unemployed people in its office, helping them to return to earning a living.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hunky dory</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The association also launches another famous initiative: <em>Die Brocke</em> &ndash; the hunks.Every day, it collects junk and rubbish on the streets of Berlin then processes it in its own workshops. Today we would call this &ldquo;upcycling&rdquo;. Back then, these &ldquo;hunks&rdquo; &ndash; the word relates to something that is broken off, like a hunk of bread &ndash; help unemployed tradesmen, along with poor workers who can visit the shop in Wedding to buy cut-price, recycled furniture and other household goods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 1979 the Schrippenkirche e.V. association has been based in the building you see in front of you. It installed the five-tonne bread roll in the front garden to mark its 125th anniversary. It commemorates the ritual of feeding the poor that gave the association its name. Today, the building is a residential home for adults with disabilities. &ldquo;Help those who are weak to grow strong&rdquo; &ndash; Liebich&rsquo;s motto is still being lived to this day.</p>\r\n",

"teasertext": "<p>Paul versus Wilhelm &ndash; the construction of the Reichstag turns into a duel between architect and Emperor</p>\r\n",
"introtext": "<p>&ldquo;A common, ignoble dog&rdquo;, an &ldquo;imperial street urchin&rdquo;. This is how Paul Wallot, the architect of the Reichstag building, describes Wilhelm II. The Kaiser bosses him around, constantly demanding changes, until there&rsquo;s little left of Wallot&rsquo;s prize-winning design.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>As for Wilhelm II, he complains to a friend that the Reichstag under construction is a &ldquo;completely failed creation&rdquo;, and &ldquo;the pinnacle of bad taste&rdquo;. He&rsquo;s not only angry about the building, but also about the institution that will be moving in. As Emperor by the grace of God, he is horrified at the thought of a democratically elected parliament. He displays his contempt for the freely elected representatives of the people, spluttering: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the same to me whether the monkeys leaping around in this Reichstag cage are yellow, red or black.&rdquo; Wilhelm II never entered the Reichstag through the West Portal, where you are now standing. Indeed, he only visited the building once after it opened, entering through the Kaiser Portal on the other side.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wilhelm, Friedrich and Wilhelm lay the cornerstone&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problems begin well before the first stone is laid. The Reichstag needs a new building, and Chancellor Bismarck wants to build it outside Berlin. The decision is made to build near the Brandenburg Gate (on the outskirts of the city at the time), but the owner of the existing palace refuses to sell his property. The site only becomes available after his death. Frankfurt architect Paul Wallot wins a contest to design the new building. After the Kaiser himself and his Prussian building department have proposed a string of changes, Wilhelm I finally approves Wallot&rsquo;s plans in December 1883. On 9 June 1884 he turns up to lay the foundation stone, with his heir Friedrich and grandson Wilhelm in tow. Thud, thud, thud &ndash; the Emperor and 80 dignitaries perform the three traditional hammer blows.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>No, Your Majesty&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once Wilhelm II ascends to the throne in 1888 he and the architect are even more at loggerheads. Although he is not the client, the Emperor blithely begins meddling with the project, saying: &ldquo;My son, this is how we&rsquo;ll do it&rdquo;. But Wallot is having none of it: &ldquo;Majesty, I can&rsquo;t do that.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their personal animosity hits new heights when they begin arguing about the location of the stone dome. In the democratic tradition of the Age of Metternich, Wallot wants it to act as a symbol for the whole nation. Wilhelm II is already furious that the people&rsquo;s representatives dare to use the &ldquo;majestic form of the dome&rdquo; <sup>2</sup> in the parliament&rsquo;s architecture, in direct competition with the dome on his palace. He calls for it to be relocated above the western entrance foyer, which you can see behind the tall glass doors. But Wallot stands firm. The supporting walls of the debating chamber are not strong enough to support a stone dome. Undeterred, Wallot&#39;s engineer Hermann Zimmermann has a bright idea: a state-of-the-art, technically advanced structure made of steel and glass.

This subsequent winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature reads aloud to his guests from <em>Bahnw&auml;rter Thiel (Signalman Thiel)</em> a novel that is now considered a seminal work of the Naturalism movement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Impressed, the members of Durch! head home after the reading. Artistic differences lead to the break-up of the society within the year, but two of its members who were on that train &ndash; Wilhelm B&ouml;lsche and Bruno Wille &ndash; are still looking to shake things up. Around 1890 they settle by the lake at Friedrichshagen am M&uuml;ggelsee, where they begin to attract like-minded writers and artists to their Friedrichshagen Writers&rsquo; Circle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Free spirits gather at the M&uuml;ggelsee&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;re standing outside house number 254. This is where a loose association of free spirits has formed, coming together regularly to share their views and ideas. Behind this fa&ccedil;ade with the memorial plaque to Wilhelm B&ouml;lsche, the first female winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Bertha von Suttner, can be found deep in conversation with the founder of anthroposophy, Rudolf Steiner. Meanwhile Frank Wedekind, the author of <em>Fr&uuml;hlings Erwachen (Spring Awakening)</em>, might be found debating with German-Jewish writer Else Lasker-Sch&uuml;ler or the groundbreaking Swedish author August Strindberg. The Haus am See provides these leading thinkers and other friends of B&ouml;lsche and Wille with the perfect environment for developing their ideas &ndash; ideas that will have a lasting impact on society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Circle&rsquo;s members follow the principles put forward by the Life Reform Movement, a broad coalition of groups that takes a critical view of industrialisation and urbanisation and promotes a return to a more natural way of life. These liberal ideas have an impact, with members of the Friedrichshagen group setting up the Neue Gemeinschaft, an anarchistic, communist community at the Schlachtensee. Germany&#39;s first vegetarian community also emerges from the circle of friends who meet at the M&uuml;ggelsee. At the turn of the 20th century, a community known as Eden opened its doors in Oranienburg and began supplying vegetarian products to large Berlin kitchens. Here in Friedrichshagen, the friends come together to discuss and debate free religion, naturopathy, rural communities, new kinds of education&hellip; the list goes on. They also put pen to paper, with B&ouml;lsche&#39;s book <em>Liebesleben in der Natur (Love Life in Nature) </em>proving to be a hit, particularly among the working class.</p>\r\n",

Tonight is a special night. The actor is about to go on stage to play G&ouml;tz von Berlichingen to celebrate the opening of the new Volksb&uuml;hne people&rsquo;s theatre. &ldquo;Long live freedom!&rdquo; Goethe&rsquo;s words will soon be ringing out across the auditorium.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>But, today of all days, a technical problem ruins plans for the opening of this state-of-the art theatre. The revolving stage isn&rsquo;t working. A last-minute decision is taken to perform <em>When the Young Wine Blossoms</em> by Bj&ouml;rnstjerne Bj&ouml;rnson instead. But this comedy from the company&rsquo;s repertoire doesn&rsquo;t really reflect the theatre&rsquo;s political stance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take a close look at the building in front of you. Every single brick was paid for by workers&rsquo; hard-earned pennies. The Freie Volksb&uuml;hne association (Free People&rsquo;s Theatre) was established in Berlin in 1890. It was the first cultural/political organisation to be set up by working-class members, who scrimped and saved to build this temple of the theatre.&nbsp; Their somewhat militant slogan was: &ldquo;Bring art to the people!&rdquo;. <sup>1 </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These words written by Dr Bruno Wille in an article in the <em>Berliner Volksblatt</em> on 23 March 1890 led to the founding of the Freie Volksb&uuml;hne. Wille and theatre director Otto Brahm were the driving force behind the new association. It had a clear aim: workers who are usually denied access to culture for financial reasons should be able to afford to enjoy the theatre and its educational benefits. The Freie Volksb&uuml;hne initially puts on plays in private theatres that support the association&rsquo;s aims. It charges its members 50 pfennigs to go in. Members can enter a draw to win seats in a box or on the balcony. Class boundaries become blurred as the proletariat emancipates itself and appropriates the theatre culture of the bourgeoisie.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>One of the side effects is the promotion of contemporary works that criticise society&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the unique features of the Freie Volksb&uuml;hne benefits contemporary authors such as Gerhard Hauptmann. The association&rsquo;s productions are classed as private events, so Prussian censors can&rsquo;t get their hands on the scripts. The police decide to send their informers in to spy on the radical cultural association. The authorities hear they are staging socially critical plays &ndash; tales of working-class life spoken in dialect, the language of the people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1912, the members of the association &ndash; which at its height number almost 160,000 &ndash; decide to build their own theatre. They appoint famous theatre architect Oskar Kaufmann, who helps them to build their own theatre under the most trying of circumstances. When the foundation stone is laid in September 1913, nobody imagines that it will be built while the First World War is raging.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2,000-seat Volksb&uuml;hne theatre is built in the heart of the poor Scheunenviertel district. The association&rsquo;s members are bringing theatre to the people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>G&ouml;tz von Berlichingen hits the stage in the New Year&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rudolf Werner gets to play G&ouml;tz a few days later. The local press is kind about the debacle on the opening night: &ldquo;According to superstition, a little bad luck at the start of an undertaking is an omen of its future success.&rdquo; <sup>2 </sup>How right they are!</p>\r\n",

A group of young hikers are wandering through the forests and meadows, singing as they go: &ldquo;You birds of passage in the air / in the glow of the ether, in the scent of summer / in the waves of blue sky / You are my companions.&ldquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The teacher knows how to inspire his young students to enjoy the simple pleasures of the great outdoors &ndash; they sleep under the stars and cook their own meals. For the grammar school students from the middle-class district of Steglitz, freedom smells of pine trees, freshly cut hay and campfires.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Hoffmann leaves Berlin, a sixth-former, Karl Fischer, takes over as leader of the group. They want him to stay on as leader after he&rsquo;s finished his exams and left school, so they decide to change the club&rsquo;s legal framework. On 4 November 1901, the group meets in the basement of Steglitz town hall to set up a new committee for organising student hiking trips. The name of the new group, <em>Wandervogel</em>, or bird of passage, is taken from the words of a poem by Otto Roquettes that they like to recite when they&rsquo;re out hiking. Now the group can show their parents and the school that the club has an official, legal framework that will allow them to carry on as before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>There&rsquo;s no escape from Prussian discipline </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The industrialisation of the German Empire is picking up speed and Berlin is rapidly expanding. The members of the Wandervogel movement are keen to escape the narrow confines of school and society by getting back to nature. Other clubs spring up under the umbrella of the life reform movement, which promotes progressive teaching, naturism and naturopathy and is an alternative to the prevailing modernism. Back to nature might sound romantic, but the <em>Wandervogel </em>group is organised along very strict lines. There is no doubt that Karl Fischer is the group&rsquo;s leader. He alone decides who can join the club and hike with the group as a novice, and only after they have sworn an oath of allegiance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When they&rsquo;re out hiking, the Wandervogel are easy to spot. They wear knee breeches, long woollen socks, waterproof capes and red neckerchiefs. They carry rucksacks, hiking poles and wear green club caps with gold and red stripes. Some of them carry guitars and other instruments, as they like to sing along the way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original Wandervogel group in Steglitz splits up after just three years, mainly because of Fischer&#39;s authoritarian leadership style. But by then the Wandervogel have become a national youth movement. &quot;The movement had no fixed goals, they just wanted to ramble, explore, experience and be free&rdquo;, writes H. Schierer on the 50th anniversary of the founding of the movement. <sup>1</sup> This makes it susceptible to external influences, and later on it&rsquo;s easy for the Nazis to integrate the hikers into the Hitler Youth movement. &ldquo;I am also a bird of passage / I am carried by the breath of life / and my gift of song / is my dearest possession.&rdquo;</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>As far as Arthur Hobrecht is concerned, the whole thing stinks. Berlin&rsquo;s mayor has a problem. The city is mushrooming, and its sanitation system is at breaking point. The gutters in the streets and even the River Spree itself are becoming cesspools. Berlin smells like a toilet used by a million people.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>It&rsquo;s not just the disgusting smell. The city is totally unhygienic and urgent action is needed. The eminent physician Rudolf Virchow raises the alarm and warns of cholera and typhoid epidemics if the city&rsquo;s streets and water supplies continue to be contaminated by excrement. The old wells have been replaced with a drinking water supply, but sewage is a growing problem. The city&rsquo;s sewage system has never been upgraded. Berlin&rsquo;s 16,000 water closets are flushed into the metre-wide gutters that line the streets. The majority of residents still have outhouses in their backyards, from where the waste is collected and often illegally dumped into the Spree under cover of darkness. Rats rummage through the waste looking for food, and a permanent foul stench hangs in the air. The rain regularly rinses out the gutters, but in winter the wastewater freezes, turning the streets to sheet ice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>No more sewage in the streets&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The liberal mayor&rsquo;s brother, James Hobrecht, made a name for himself in 1862 when he came up with his <em>Land Use Plan for the Environs of Berlin</em> &ndash; known as the Hobrecht Plan. Earlier plans had been rejected, such as pouring all the city&rsquo;s sewage into the Spree. Holbrecht is charged with planning and building a new sewage and drainage system.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier in his career, Hobrecht had travelled to many major cities to study their sewer systems. Armed with this knowledge, the new urban planning office draws up a plan for Berlin, which it presents to the city council on 16 November 1872. It recommends the construction of twelve separate pumping stations, known as radial systems. The name comes from the sewer pipes that run down to the centre of the circular systems, like the spokes of a wheel. Pumping stations like the <em>Radialsystem V </em>pumping station that you see in front of you dispersed the sewage to drainage fields outside the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Two-way traffic </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>More and more people are leaving the countryside and heading for the city &ndash; meaning more and more sewage has to be pumped the other way. Sewage from <em>Pumping Station V </em>ends up in the sewage farms of northern Falkenberg. It passes through a pressure pipe into a settling tank where the solid sediment is skimmed off. Then it is spread over the drainage fields, where it is filtered through several layers of soil. Once it has been purified in this way, the water returns to the groundwater. James Hobrecht&#39;s radial system cleans up Berlin, improves the health of its inhabitants and makes lasting changes to the urban landscape. The sewer system is an ingenious city beneath the city.</p>\r\n",

He is met with a sea of welcome banners and deluged with requests for autographs. His waxwork even goes on display in the wax museum on Unter den Linden. Voight is whisked from the Tegel penitentiary straight to a recording studio, where, for 200 marks, he records a message of thanks to all his supporters and adds a short prayer of his own: &ldquo;I may be free now &ndash; but I hope and pray that God will keep me from being an outlaw again.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The smartest criminal in the empire </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Impersonating an officer, offences against public order, wrongful imprisonment, serious fraud and forgery &ndash; the fact that he&rsquo;s so popular despite his long list of offences is down to the nature of his crimes. Wilhelm Voigt&rsquo;s exploits hold up a mirror to Prussian militarism and the obedience that the military commands. The man in the street is more amused than indignant. Voigt&rsquo;s big adventure begins on 16 October 1906 right where you are now, next to his bronze statue. We are at K&ouml;penick town hall, which he occupies in a surprise coup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a former convict, Voigt is not allowed to live in Berlin. This makes it almost impossible for the trained shoemaker to stay on the straight and narrow (and this is later considered a mitigating circumstance). He purchases parts of used captain&rsquo;s uniforms from junk shops and disguises himself as a captain of the Prussian First Guard Regiment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wearing this disguise, he commandeers a troop of guardsmen in Pl&ouml;tzensee. They all take a train to K&ouml;penick. During the journey, the bogus captain buys his men a beer and a bite to eat &ndash; and instructs them to &ldquo;arrest the mayor and perhaps other gentlemen&rdquo; <sup>2 </sup>when they get there.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When they arrive at the town hall, Voigt marches his men into the office of the mayor Georg Langerhans and says he has orders to take him to the New Guardhouse in Berlin.

"introtext": "<p>Amelia Jenny Emilie Klothilde Johanna Braun, known as Lily, has a vision. She wants women to be able to combine a family with working life. Back in 1901 this was a revolutionary idea. Her solution is to build cooperative housing with a communal kitchen.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>As the daughter of the distinguished General von Kretschmann, Lily Braun grows up in Prussia&rsquo;s wealthy upper class, where women are judged predominantly on their appearance. But she soon begins questioning the position of women in aristocratic society.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Work/life balance under the Kaiser&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a pioneer of German feminism and a committed social democrat, she has a clear goal: equal rights for men and women. She wants all women to be free to make their own decisions &ndash; both as mothers and in the workplace. But she believes they are held back by the burden of domestic chores, so she revives an old socialist idea &ndash; cooperative living.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Housing is in short supply after the First World War, so Lily proposes building apartment blocks with communal kitchens. They would be equipped with all mod cons, reduce construction costs and be managed by employees. For Lily, the advantages are obvious: communal household management would liberate women from domestic chores, promote emancipation, reform family life and even improve eating habits.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mod cons and the masses don&rsquo;t mix&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite her enthusiasm, she is unable to win the support of the socialist women&#39;s movement. Her critics say the costs involved make her idea unsuitable for the working class. But Lily is undeterred. In 1903 she commissions architect Kurt Berndt to design a building with a communal kitchen on Olivaer Platz. Apart from the large kitchen, the building will have &ldquo;bright, airy, simple apartments of all sizes with bathrooms, gas cooking facilities, central heating, gas and electric lighting and passenger lifts in the equally well-equipped front and rear-facing parts of the building.&rdquo; <sup>1&nbsp; </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will also come with mod cons such as a centrally controlled vacuum cleaner system. But by 1904 the project is already struggling due to lack of funds, and it is abandoned later that year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, in 1908 and 1909 several buildings with communal kitchens are constructed by the Eink&uuml;chenhaus-Gesellschaft der Berliner Vororte, an association set up for this purpose. The first of these is built at Kuno-Fischer-Stra&szlig;e 13. But the idea still fails to catch on, and the communal kitchens are replaced with small private kitchens within a few years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the idea of communal housing has never died out, Since then, Berlin has been home to a range of cooperative living initiatives, such as the Corbusier House, and the M29 and Mehringhof housing projects.</p>\r\n",

Some visitors are so angry about the modern style of the paintings that they try to deface them &ndash; the &ldquo;Br&uuml;cke&rdquo; artists have arrived in Berlin.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>When Fritz Bleyl, Erich Heckel, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff first met in Dresden eight years earlier, they had no inkling of the impact they would have on the evolution of 20th-century art. The four architecture students were just keen to find a new form of free artistic expression and break with artistic convention. Later, Heckel comments: &ldquo;We were clear about what we wanted to get away from &ndash; but less clear about where we were going&rdquo;. <sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pioneers of Expressionism&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 7 June 1905, these four self-taught artists form Die Br&uuml;cke (The Bridge). The group have no interest in producing lifelike art but want to portray their subjective perceptions in their work. They not only reject the established conventions and aesthetics of classical art, but also its techniques. They change shapes, dispense with details and perspectives, reduce motifs to simple woodcut-like forms, use vibrant colours &ndash; and become pioneers of German Expressionism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After 1906, other artists, such as Max Pechstein, join the group and they recruit a number of passive members and sponsors. The Expressionist rebels move to Berlin from 1908 onwards, but they are cold-shouldered by the city&rsquo;s leading artistic movement, the Berlin Secession.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Chamber of Horrors&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In protest, the Br&uuml;cke artists join a break-away group called the Neue Secession (New Secession). At their first exhibition in May 1910, some of the paintings are damaged by the &ldquo;delinquents&rdquo; that Pechstein later mentions. Their work comes under fire in the press, who refer to the room where the Br&uuml;cke group are exhibiting as the &ldquo;Chamber of Horrors&rdquo;. <sup>3&nbsp; </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite this controversial debut, the Expressionists gain a degree of recognition in Berlin, but the group breaks up in 1913 due to personal and professional differences. The Nazis outlaw the Br&uuml;cke style of art in the 1930s, branding it &ldquo;degenerate&rdquo;. The artists are no longer allowed to exhibit, and their paintings are confiscated or destroyed. Ernst Ludwig Kirchner kills himself with a shot to the heart on 15 June 1938.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The artistic movement only gains international recognition after the war. Karl Schmidt-Rottluff begins building a Br&uuml;cke museum in the early Sixties. It opens seven years later in the Dahlem district of Berlin. Today, the bungalow-style building houses the largest displayed collection of the group&rsquo;s works, including 400 paintings and thousands of drawings, watercolours and sculptures.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>&ldquo;When you look around you, why would you want to leave?&rdquo; <sup>1</sup> Gerd Reimer, a resident of the Lindenhof development, asks this question during an interview in April 2012. He is battling serious illness and dies shortly afterwards. He lived his whole life in the Lindenhof, a place that his family has called home for four generations. His great-grandmother, grandmother and parents all lived in this residential development in the southernmost corner of Berlin&#39;s Sch&ouml;neberg district. And when you look around this oasis in the heart of the city, you have to agree with Gerd Reimer &ndash; it&rsquo;s a very special place.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>The story begins in 1918 when Martin Wagner, architect and head of urban planning for Sch&ouml;neberg, conceives and plans the redevelopment of this former pioneer settlement into a garden city. The idea is to create a residential development that provides ample green spaces, community facilities, affordable housing and the potential for self-sufficiency. In short: a breath of fresh air in the heart of the city.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under Wagner&rsquo;s supervision, an oasis is created in Sch&ouml;neberg, with park-like green spaces, ponds dating back to the Ice Age, a patch of woodland and houses with gardens. The development&rsquo;s architecture has a special feature: doors, windows and gateways with pointed arches. As you admire the old trees that still stand here today, you can feel how the Berliners must have breathed a sigh of relief when they moved here in the 1920s.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After its completion in 1920, the new residential development is taken over by what is now the GeWoS&uuml;d housing cooperative. Around 80% of the buildings were destroyed during the Second World War. The reconstructions you see here today are a mix of 20th-century architectural styles, including row-house apartment blocks from the 1950s, multi-storey residential buildings and tower blocks from the 1960s and 1970s, and a relatively new semicircular building from 1990, built on the last remaining vacant plot.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rebuilding of the Lindenhof residential development was close to Gerd Reimer&rsquo;s heart. <sup>2</sup> From a young age, he was committed to the idea of cooperative living, and it is something today&rsquo;s residents are still keen to preserve. They tend their gardens, keep bees, come together for brunches and sports activities in a self-determined, tolerant and open community. Lindenhof resident Ute Sperling says: &ldquo;For me, cooperative living is synonymous with community, the common good, common interests and a common residential area.&quot; <sup>3&nbsp;</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lindenhof is still something of a pioneering settlement. A new energy concept introduced in 2009 has drastically reduced its carbon footprint, tree sponsorship schemes have been set up, new maisonette-type apartments are being built and extensive renovation work is steaming ahead. GeWoS&uuml;d has received several awards for its Lindenhof &ndash; Traditionally Modern concept.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, some 2,500 people live in the Lindenhof development. Many people are impressed by its green concept and would love to join the cooperative, while others &ndash; like Gerd Reimer &ndash; have lived here for generations and can&rsquo;t imagine leaving their green oasis in the heart of the city.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>On 21 April 1921, the <em>Berliner Tageblatt</em> reports on the &ldquo;aberrations&rdquo; <sup>1</sup> being exhibited at an art fair in the Tiergarten district and announces that the artists responsible will be charged with systematic defamation of the German army.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>Looking back, it&rsquo;s hardly surprising that Germany is the place where Dadaists end up in court. Founded by Richard Huelsenbeck, Hugo Ball and other artists in Zurich in 1916, the Dada movement finds its most extreme expression in Berlin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The legal sequel to the First International Dada Fair at the Dr Otto Burchard Gallery is motivated by exhibits such as a stuffed soldier with a pig&#39;s head and the figure of a woman with an Iron Cross on her back. George Grosz and Wieland Herzfelde are fined 300 and 600 Reichsmarks for shattering these wartime taboos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Destroying the established order&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The spirit of provocation goes back to the movement&rsquo;s origins in Switzerland. Huelsenbeck, Ball and others seek to sever their connections with existing art forms and advocate total artistic freedom. Rules, discipline and morals are to be replaced with absolute creative freedom and untamed spontaneity. The Dadaists insist that Dada cannot be defined &ndash; so there is no need to commit to anything. Their aim is &ldquo;anti-art&rdquo;, the ultimate in freedom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The painters, musicians, writers and dancers challenge the authorities and undermine the establishment with their provocative collages, sound poems and performances, and by insulting their audiences. Their aim is &ldquo;to frighten people and secure their own freedom&rdquo;. The movement is not only an entertaining &ldquo;laboratory of higher nonsense&rdquo; but an unflinching response to the senselessness of the World War that is still raging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;A match in a powder keg&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dadaism can only emerge in Berlin towards the end of the war. On 12 April 1918, Richard Huelsenbeck presents a Dadaist manifesto at the Berlin Secession, an alternative art association. It has quite an impact. The graphic designer Hannah H&ouml;ch later describes the effect as &ldquo;a match thrown into a powder keg&rdquo;. Berlin artists are infected by Dada &ndash; and now they want to go their own way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raoul Hausmann takes the sound poetry that was invented in Zurich and moves it to the next level. He works with H&ouml;ch, Grosz and John Heartfield to create the first ever photomontages. The revolutionary use of real photos &ndash; and hence real people &ndash; makes Dada artworks even more original and heightens their controversy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dadaism in Berlin hits its high point with the First International Dada Fair. After this, interest in Dada gradually wanes (there is no second international fair). But the provocateurs around Huelsenbeck and Grosz have created a new kind of artistic freedom, introduced new ideas, techniques and processes, and paved the way for Surrealism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, they continue to influence artists and art movements, but something has happened that the Dadaists never wanted &ndash; their works can be found in galleries and museums alongside those of &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; artists. They have become an official part of art history.</p>\r\n",

When he gets off the tram, he&rsquo;s attacked quite out of the blue by baton-wielding policemen.

Life is hard for workers because food prices and rents are soaring while wages remain low. Workers at Kupfer coal merchants are fighting for a pay rise from 43 to 50 pfennigs an hour. When management rejects their demands, the workers walk out on 19 September.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Industrialist Hugo Stinnes tries to keep his company&#39;s coal business running, but every day there are angry demonstrations. Stinnes asks the police for help and hires an expert strike-breaker called Hintze. He boasts: &ldquo;I can break any strike. In eight days I can have six thousand men here.&rdquo; <sup>3 </sup>His armed strike-breakers eventually arrive on 23 September. This enrages the local residents, who side with the strikers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A strike becomes a riot </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both sides are quick to espouse violence and the strike becomes a bloody battle between picketers and locals on one side and law enforcement and strike-breakers on the other. Police wade into the crowd with their batons, windows are shattered. Stones, bottles and pots rain down. On 25 September, the Kupfer company sends a telegraphs Stinnes, saying: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a full-blown battle.&rdquo; <sup>4 </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two days later, Berlin&rsquo;s police superintendent Traugott von Jagow orders his men to use firearms. 30,000 people are out on the streets. On 27 September, his officers fire on the protesters and crush the rebellion. The people of Moabit are defeated and the strike is over.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final shot rings out, the angry mob draws back &ndash; and an elderly man lies dead in the street. He had left his house to look for his son and been run through with a sabre. The police have attacked him for no reason, just like Katzmarek. Fortunately, the clerk escapes from the police by jumping onto a passing tram.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The public are agitated about police brutality and the question of who is to blame for the violence. In October, tens of thousands of workers take to the streets in Moabit to protest against police brutality, followed by more demonstrations four weeks later in Wedding. In his diary, Erich M&uuml;hsam concludes: &ldquo;The whole episode is yet further evidence of something I&rsquo;ve known all along: that Berlin workers are the best, the manliest, the most independent and the most libertarian in Germany.&rdquo; <sup>5</sup></p>\r\n",

"mainText": "<p>The project description that the railway company issues to its new chief architect states he is to take on &ldquo;the artistic supervision of the construction work, the elaboration of all construction plans and detailed drawings, and the design of all the artistic decoration for the building&rdquo;. <sup>1 </sup>Anhalter station originally opened in 1841 and was gradually expanded to cope with the growth in rail traffic. Now, at the dawn of the German Empire, it is to be completely rebuilt. Schwechten, a native of Cologne, is the government&rsquo;s new chief architect. He leaps at the opportunity to add a major new building project to his architectural portfolio. The long-distance train station near Potsdamer Platz in Berlin has to be appropriately grand for an up-and-coming city like Berlin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A monument for a metropolis </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you stand in front of what little is left of Anhalter station, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine the sheer scale of this magnificent building. It was badly damaged during the war and the Senate ordered its demolition in 1959. All that remains it its imposing entrance. Can you see the football pitch behind it? The two rows of oak trees either side of the pitch mark where the station concourse used to run. It stretched as far as the Tempodrom. Schwechten has the entire concourse covered with a gigantic single-span, arched steel and glass roof. The roof spans 63 metres, the biggest in Europe and a masterpiece of engineering. &ldquo;The roof spans an area of 10,200 m&sup2; without any supports, and 40,000 people can stand under it at the same time&rdquo;. <sup>2 </sup>This is the admiring description published in the architectural journal <em>Wochenblatt f&uuml;r Architekten und Ingenieure.&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schwechten also has something special in mind for the front of the building. He chooses a distinctive hard-fired yellow brick known as Greppiner Klinker for the simple yet elegant fa&ccedil;ade of this new &ldquo;Gateway to the South&rdquo;, which will connect Berlin with Rome, Athens and Constantinople. Chancellor Otto von Bismarck joins Kaiser Wilhelm I at the opening ceremony on 15 June 1880. Decades later, Schwechten is asked to design the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in honour of Wilhelm I. He is also the architect behind many of the churches, villas, administrative buildings and industrial complexes that shape Berlin in the Wilhelmine era. Most of them are destroyed during the Second World War.</p>\r\n",

But he&rsquo;s also a little tight-fisted, and when he decides to cut his musicians&#39; already modest wages and make them travel by train to a concert in fourth class, it&rsquo;s the final straw. Today, the Berliner Philharmoniker is one of the world&#39;s top orchestras, but it started out as a rebellion.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>50 of the 56 musicians refuse to sign Bilse&#39;s new contract. They decide it&rsquo;s better to go freelance than let the popular maestro treat them like day labourers. On 1 May 1882 they sign a notarised agreement binding the members of the new ensemble to &ldquo;mutual steadfast solidarity&rdquo;. <sup>1</sup> Now all the musicians will play at their own risk. Now it is up to them who joins the orchestra and what works to perform. And they will elect their principal conductor by secret ballot &ndash; as they still do to this day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A roller skating rink becomes a temple of the Muses </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The orchestra now calls itself the Former <em>Bilse&rsquo;s Ensemble</em>. But it&rsquo;s not all plain sailing, and there are times when the ensemble led by conductor Ludwig von Brenner comes close to splitting up. The first concert by the now independent ensemble is put on at the <em>Sing-Akademie</em>. In the summer of 1882 they find a more suitable venue: the Central Skating Rink here in Bernburger Stra&szlig;e. You are standing in front of what is left of this building. Go through the old archway into the courtyard. You will see a plaque commemorating the fact that this legendary venue was once used by the Berlin Philharmonic. The building has a stage and its own restaurant. On 17 October 1882, the musicians perform for the first time as the <em>Philharmonic Orchestra</em> at the behest of concert agent Hermann Wolff, while the audience happily munches and slurps away.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Philharmonic becomes a world-renowned orchestra </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1887, Hans von B&uuml;low, a progressive and uncompromising conductor, takes over at the Berlin Philharmonic. He whips his musicians into shape with endless rehearsals, turning them into a world-class orchestra. Meanwhile, the architect Franz Schwechten is rebuilding the old roller skating rink. The stage that was originally off to one side is moved to the end, and the panelled ceiling is raised and decorated with sound-absorbing plaster. Stucco medallions and portraits of composers adorn the walls. The auditorium can now seat 2,500 people. With an optimum reverberation time of two seconds, the Philharmonie&rsquo;s acoustics are outstanding.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many of the world&rsquo;s leading musicians play here in Bernburger Strasse, until the Philharmonie is razed to the ground by an aerial bombing raid during the Second World War. On 15 October 1963 the Berlin Philharmonic moves into a new home in the Kulturforum Berlin. But the musicians still enjoy more freedom than any other orchestra in the world.</p>\r\n",

And this is where Kaiser Wilhelm II has decided to lay the foundation stone for a church. In memory of his grandfather, it will be called the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>It&rsquo;s a bright, crisp spring day. The site for the new church has been acquired by the Evangelical Church Building Association and been brightly decorated for the special occasion. The same goes for the surrounding streets &ndash; after all, it&rsquo;s not every day that Wilhelm II and his wife Auguste Viktoria pay a visit. An obelisk&nbsp; stands on Hardenbergstra&szlig;e, between the Zoologischer Garten station and the building site, and Wilhelm I is also honoured with the presentation of a bronze bust.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The guests of honour begin to arrive in the freshly spruced-up neighbourhood. They include churchmen, politicians, courtiers and of course, in Wilhelm&rsquo;s Prussia, the top military brass. A tent has been erected and is proudly flying the purple imperial standard. After all, the emperor and his wife can&rsquo;t be expected to stand outside. From here, a few steps lead down to where the foundation stone is to be laid, directly beneath what will be the main tower. You are standing on the exact spot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Birthday celebrations </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The coach bearing the Kaiser and his consort pulls up to loud cheers from the crowd. The music of the military band fills the square, the priest clears his throat to give his welcoming speech, and Wilhelm and Auguste solemnly sign the foundation deed. It is soldered into a small copper case, which will be inserted into the cornerstone. The cannons thunder their salute, while the Emperor applies the mortar and lays the foundation stone with three blows of the hammer. It was his idea to hold the ceremony on his grandfather&rsquo;s birthday &ndash; Wilhelm I would have turned 94 today.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wilhelm II is the driving force behind the construction of the Memorial Church. He has long been fighting for the &ldquo;return of unbelievers (...) to the Church and (...) love for the monarchy&rdquo;. <sup>1</sup> He believes strengthening the Emperor and the Church is the way to counter the impending threat of socialism and anarchy. Auguste Viktoria is the patron of the Evangelical Church Aid Association and her Lord Chamberlain is overseeing the building project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the next few years, architect Franz Schwechten will erect a free-standing, monumental church building in a style that perfectly suits the Kaiser&rsquo;s taste. Wilhelm believes the Romanesque-inspired architecture is an expression of a &ldquo;pure Germanic&rdquo; style. For a Protestant church, it has an unusually rich interior. From where you are standing in the Memorial Hall, you can still make out its former magnificence. The statues, reliefs and mosaics on the vaults depict religious scenes but also pay tribute to the Hohenzollern dynasty. No-one should forget they are emperors by the grace of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Kaiser keeps his hand firmly in his pocket </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new landmark in the west of the city is consecrated four-and-a-half years later. The design of the church is certainly not restrained, but Wilhelm II displays a certain restraint when it comes to putting his hand in his pocket. The building costs &ndash; today&rsquo;s equivalent of 45 million euros &ndash; are covered by rich donors from every corner of his realm.</p>\r\n",

"mainText": "<p>Kaiser Wilhelm II and his Chancellor know very little about astrology.&nbsp; Rather than at the heavens, their gaze tends to be directed towards their eternal rivals, Paris and London. Unlike these two cities, Berlin has never hosted a world fair.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Academics, artistic directors and architects all believe it&rsquo;s high time for Berlin to host an international exhibition. But their rulers remain unconvinced of the benefits. Paris might be rapidly turning into a den of iniquity, but Berlin has other things to offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Creative compromise </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, it&rsquo;s the Association of Berlin Merchants and Industrialists (VBKI) that sets the project in motion. If not a world fair, then how about an industrial exhibition? The Emperor agrees &ndash; an exhibition of the latest technology is very much his cup of tea. It would also serve as a useful distraction from the looming economic crisis. But this kind of thing takes money, as astronomer Archenhold knows all too well. His new telescope will have a focal length of 21 metres, making it unique and very expensive. Fortunately, he has attracted enough donations to give his design work free rein.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The exhibition comes and goes but the sky cannon remains </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Archenhold plans and builds, the elite of German industry are setting up shop in 300 exhibition buildings. The Observatory is finally ready after many months of delays. But it&rsquo;s worth the wait. The giant telescope, nicknamed the sky cannon, attracts hordes of visitors who want to get closer to the stars. Faced with so much enthusiasm, the Kaiser finds it hard to say no. He allows the small planetarium to be the only building to remain standing once the exhibition closes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The world&rsquo;s most famous stargazer, Albert Einstein, visits the planetarium on 15 July 1915 and gives his first lecture on relativity. Archenhold and Einstein have a close, collegial relationship based on a shared passion for science and their Jewish roots. They will both suffer anti-Semitic attacks in the years to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Einstein emigrates to the USA, the Archenhold family with their five children opt to stay in Berlin. It proves to be a fatal decision. Friedrich Archenhold dies in 1939 in the knowledge that his son G&uuml;nther had to flee to England after the Nazis refused to let him take over as director of the observatory. His wife Alice is murdered in Theresienstadt concentration camp on 9 February 1943. His daughter Hilde also dies there. His other three children, Horst, Lilly and Ilse, manage to escape the Nazis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

He is looking to build quickly and cheaply so that he can service the loan with rental income, just like the big property companies. They are making fat profits because of the massive demand for housing in the growing city.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The march of industrialisation brought thousands of workers flocking to Berlin. When the German Reich was founded in 1871, 825,000 people lived in the city. This figure had doubled by 1895. A census taken on 2 December of that year gave the total population as 1,677,304. Smart villas began springing up in areas like Grunewald, and Berlin&rsquo;s characteristic tenements were built to house factory and office workers. You can see them here in Prenzlauer Berg, around Helmholtzplatz.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Master carpenter Brunzel needs to raise more money to build his apartment block. The lenders impose certain conditions, insisting on front and rear-facing buildings, side wings and a transverse section. Maximum living space for maximum profit &ndash; off the backs of people whose wages are barely enough to live on. &ldquo;Never before has the need for housing been so unscrupulously turned into a means of generating profit&rdquo;. <sup>1</sup> This is how liberal art critic Karl Scheffler later denounces the beneficiaries of the house-building boom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Living in barely tolerable conditions </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the working-class neighbourhoods, people&rsquo;s homes are dark, cold and damp. <em>Trockenwohnen </em>is booming. This is the practice of renting out unfinished apartments in which the cheap lime mortar gives off moisture as it hardens. They are terrible places to live, but for many families it&rsquo;s the only way they can afford a roof over their heads. They stay there for about three months until the walls have dried out and they are required to pay the full rent, then off they go to their next damp building. People who can actually afford dry apartments rent out rooms to maids and day labourers, though this means they and their families have to sleep in a single room.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Brunzel makes a mistake </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If he&rsquo;s to make his mortgage payments, the master carpenter has to work fast. He&rsquo;s decided to build a brick building with thick mortar joints and wood-beamed ceilings. The first tenants arrive in early 1896, but of course they are paying reduced rents because the building is drying out. Brunzel fights hard to keep his building but ends up losing everything. He is forced to sell Dunckerstra&szlig;e 77 at auction because he can&rsquo;t make meet his interest payments. This turns out to be a good deal for the new owner, a property company, because the building is now fully let.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now you can travel back in time to the 19th century and find out what it was like to live in Brunzel&#39;s apartment building and similar tenements in Berlin.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>If it were up to Werner von Siemens, you&rsquo;d be standing in the middle of Friedrichstra&szlig;e right now. But the city authorities were reluctant to have a train clattering down the narrow shopping street. So Germany&rsquo;s first elevated electric railway &ndash; and only the fifth in Europe &ndash; was built here instead. The viaduct over Kleiststra&szlig;e and B&uuml;lowstra&szlig;e was designed to connect the main line between Zoologischer Garten and Schlesiches Tor.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>You are standing in front of Nollendorfplatz subway station and the rails of the U1 line are above your head. The elevated railway goes underground at this point. To the left, the line runs overground to the east, and the line on the right runs underground. The residents of Charlottenburg insisted on this as they didn&rsquo;t want their view of the new Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church to be ruined. But let&rsquo;s start at the beginning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>22 years before the first U-Bahn line is opened, Werner von Siemens presents his plans for the construction of an elevated electric railway line. Berlin is growing fast and its streets are hopelessly congested. Siemens is looking for ways of making the city&rsquo;s traffic move more freely. Horse-drawn buses and trains, steam trains &ndash; the roads are clogged with vehicles loaded with everything that needs to be moved from A to B in Germany&rsquo;s largest industrial city.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These problems could be easily resolved with an elevated railway system like the one in New York. Nowadays urban planners dream of providing citizens with easy access to public transport, and Siemens and his company Siemens &amp; Halske had demonstrated that electric-powered transport was possible. The world&#39;s first electric tram was already running in Berlin-Lichtefelde. But Berlin&rsquo;s authorities decided he couldn&rsquo;t build his railway just yet. So Siemens took himself off to Budapest and built precisely the kind of electric transit system that his home town had rejected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Perseverance pays off&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After their initial plans are rejected, Siemens &amp; Halske apply for the concession to build a railway line between Warschauer Br&uuml;cke and Zoologischer Garten. In March 1896 &ndash; three-and-a-half years after the death of Werner von Siemens &ndash; approval is granted, and the ground-breaking ceremony is held in Gitschiner Stra&szlig;e on 10 September. Berlin&rsquo;s first combined elevated and underground railway line is inaugurated on 15 February 1902 with senior dignitaries making the first official trip along the line. The U1 still runs along this historic route. As you climb the steps to the station, stop and look at the plaque commemorating Werner von Siemens&rsquo; life. The overground/underground railway line that is such an important part of city life is just one of his many contributions.</p>\r\n",

But come what may, it will be consecrated today, on His Majesty&#39;s 24th wedding anniversary.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>Wilhelm II is not too concerned about the fact that a few bronze doors are still missing and the painting above his personal box is not destined to be completed for many years. After all, he has to take the blame for some of the construction delays. No-one was given the freedom to turn their plans into reality without the Emperor&rsquo;s approval. Wilhelm II repeatedly made his architect, Julius Carl Raschdorff, revise his plans for the cathedral. The Emperor also had the final say on every single element of the cathedral&rsquo;s interior.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A monument to Church and Emperor&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you stand on the steps of the cathedral and look up at the richly decorated fa&ccedil;ade, you feel almost overwhelmed by its grandeur. This is exactly what Wilhelm II intended &ndash; for his imperial greatness to be reflected in this divine, monumental building. With the Lustgarten and Altes Museum to the rear and the Hohenzollern City Palace to the right, the new cathedral is the final piece in a complex designed to underline the monarchy&rsquo;s absolute power and the divine right of kings. Commoners and penitents feel very small when they stand before the 114-metre-high church. So it&rsquo;s fitting that the 10 million Reichsmark building costs were considered to be astronomical.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On this February morning, the grand opening ceremony begins on the dot of 11. Their majesties are given a military welcome, then the head of the cathedral building committee presents Wilhelm II with the key. He hands it to his court chaplain, Ernst Dryander, who ceremoniously opens the cathedral doors. The imperial couple and congregation enter the church to the strains of Handel&#39;s <em>Messiah</em>. &ldquo;The Empress wears a kindly expression; the Emperor is very stiff and dignified&rdquo;. This is how the newspapers describe the imperial couple the next day. <sup>1 </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Incongruous splendour&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The magnificent interior of what is now Germany&rsquo;s most important Protestant church takes your breath away. Wilhelm II specifically wants it to rival the mighty Cologne Cathedral. As you stand beneath the magnificent dome, surrounded by gold, marble, mosaics and columns, you could be in a Catholic cathedral. The design of the cathedral is very much to the Kaiser&rsquo;s taste, but the mishmash of architectural styles came under fire long before the building was completed. But now the congregation sings <em>Now Thank We All Our God</em> as the bells of all the Protestant churches in Berlin ring out in honour of the Almighty and his new cathedral.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>The Emperor is on his way to Charlottenburg. His carriage crosses the Landwehr Canal and enters the free city at today&rsquo;s Ernst-Reuter-Platz, before turning north west onto Berliner Stra&szlig;e. This is the spot where the imperial carriage drove past Charlottenburg&rsquo;s new town hall. But Wilhelm II is annoyed that the tower of this new building is several metres higher than the dome of his Charlottenburg Palace. In future, he takes a one-kilometre detour via Bismarckstra&szlig;e.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>We don&rsquo;t know whether his &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind&rdquo; approach worked. But the people of Charlottenburg don&#39;t care. This new town hall with its 88-metre-high tower was their birthday present to themselves. They built it to mark the 200th anniversary of this Brandenburg city in the affluent suburbs of Berlin, which was growing and thriving in the shadow of the imperial capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The building on what is now Otto-Suhr-Allee allowed the good burghers of Charlottenburg to display their pride in their free city. Its symmetrical fa&ccedil;ade is watched over by Pallas Athene, the Greek goddess of wisdom and warfare and protectress of cities. Stand in front of the main entrance to the tower and look up. You will see her directly above the Charlottenburg coat of arms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step inside and you&rsquo;ll see the interior is as magnificent as the exterior. Two sweeping staircases lead to the third floor, lavishly adorned with columns, reliefs, ornamentation and sculptures. Charlottenburg is Prussia&rsquo;s richest city in terms of tax revenue, and the town hall still reflects this wealth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>City of Charlottenburg </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new town hall is needed because the city is growing rapidly. Once the residence of Prussian kings, then a summer retreat for stressed Berliners, Charlottenburg soon becomes a magnet for industrialists and Berlin&rsquo;s affluent middle classes. Companies such as Schering and Siemens &amp; Halske also move in, attracting workers to the city. By 1900, this small town has 100,000 inhabitants, and this figure triples in just ten years to 300,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The old town hall is too small to serve a city of this size, so it is demolished and replaced by a new town hall designed by Heinrich Reinhardt and Georg S&uuml;&szlig;enguth. The magnificent new building costs 4.15 million marks &ndash; around 26 million euros in today&rsquo;s money. It provides the space needed for the city&rsquo;s administration, but also symbolises the town&rsquo;s growing self-confidence. This confidence is clear for all to see when the building is inaugurated on 20 May 1905, kicking off the city&rsquo;s 200th anniversary celebrations. It is also on display when the citizens of the free city vehemently oppose the incorporation of Charlottenburg into Greater Berlin, even after the First World War.</p>\r\n",

"mainText": "<p>When it opened its doors in 1929, the Caf&eacute; Moka Efti was something special. It bagged the city&rsquo;s best location on the corner of Friedrichstra&szlig;e and Leipziger Stra&szlig;e. Today it has been replaced by an office tower and apartment block. It was topped with a square tower in Wilhelmian style, a reminder of the Equitable Palace that used to stand on this spot.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A caf&eacute; with unusual features </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Moka Efti, guests sip their coffee in vast oriental-style salons. The patterned armchairs, colourful wall hangings, painted ceilings, sweeping arches and columns are all designed to give the place a Turkish, Moorish or Egyptian feel. One of the corridors is designed to look like a carriage on the Orient Express. There are concert rooms, a billiard room and &ndash; unusually for a caf&eacute; &ndash; a barber shop. Another remarkable feature is the office where secretaries handle the guests&rsquo; correspondence.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Moving on up </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the most surprising thing is the escalator that transports people from the street up to the rooms on the first and second floors. In the late 1920s escalators are still a rarity in Berlin, so it proves to be an attraction in itself. The Moka Efti uses this new mode of transportation in its advertising and the escalator becomes the coffee house&#39;s trademark. But the new contraption worries sociologist and journalist Siegfried Kracauer. He suspects that they serve &ldquo;to sensualise the easy ascent to the upper echelons&rdquo;.<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Best location in Berlin </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Moka Efti certainly attracts a varied clientele, including business people, newspaper editors, clerks from the nearby offices and banks, shoppers and&nbsp; tourists. Pop in for a shave and a coffee in the morning, sort out your overseas correspondence at lunchtime, then it&rsquo;s dancing and billiards in the evening. The Moka Efti stands out because it offers the whole caboodle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems likely that its exotic name comes courtesy of businessman Giovanni Eftimiades, who ran several restaurants in Berlin and sold coffee under the brand name Moka Efti.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two years after its opening, the Moka Efti branches out still further by setting up a dance hall. A hole is cut into the floor on the second storey so that punters can listen to the music from the palm-lined concert hall beneath. The coffee house gradually transforms itself into a dance hall and hosts the renowned James Kok Swing Orchestra in the 1930s.</p>\r\n",

And there are so many places to eat and drink, all run by the famous Kempinski family. Let&#39;s start off in the Caf&eacute; Vaterland. We sit at one of hundreds of tables illuminated by magnificent chandeliers. The walls are adorned with paintings, marble and mosaics, and the cafe has a modern, sophisticated feel. But we&rsquo;re looking for a touch of exoticism and extravagance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rhinish gaiety or Bavarian cosiness? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s take a peek at the Rhineland Terrace. Its main attraction is a 3D river diorama. In the background there&rsquo;s a painting of the Rhine valley, complete with castle ruins. In front there is a river with actual water and model boats. First you hear the birds twittering. Then a storm moves in with rain, thunder and lightning. And finally a rainbow appears &ndash; the storm is over. But none of the guests get wet. A pane of glass prevents you from getting soaked and saves your Rhineland wine from being diluted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe you prefer beer to wine? Let&rsquo;s head for the L&ouml;wenbr&auml;u. This beer cellar features a two-storey-high glass painting of the Eibsee lake and the Zugspitze mountain. Backlighting creates a range of effects, such as the morning sun and the alpenglow. Bavarian music, Bavarian dancing and, of course, Bavarian beer are also on the menu.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A quick trip to Turkey, Hungary or the Wild West? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the Haus Vaterland you can also travel further afield. There&rsquo;s a Turkish caf&eacute; that is &ldquo;surely more beautiful than any in the whole of Turkey&rdquo;, as it is described by the <em>Vossische Zeitung</em>. <sup>1 </sup>Or we can go to the Hungarian Czarda, a peasant tavern from the Puszta, where &ldquo;fiery&rdquo; music gives the evening a more melancholy feel. <sup>2 </sup>The walls of the Wild West Bar make it look like a log cabin, and it has a diorama of the Rocky Mountains. Perhaps we&rsquo;ll be served by Mohamed Husen in his cowboy gear. He&rsquo;s actually from East Africa, not North America &ndash; but we don&#39;t need to get too hung up on the details.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We finish our tour in Vienna. In the Grinzinger Heuriger tavern you sit under a lilac bower listening to the sounds of the waltz while enjoying fine wine and Viennese delicacies. But now you&rsquo;ve probably had enough. The Haus Vaterland knows how to overwhelm your eyes, ears and taste buds! I hope you&rsquo;ve enjoyed your tour and it wasn&rsquo;t too crowded &ndash; despite the fact that it has had 8,000 visitors today.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

The clientele is a mix of workers and lower middle class, the kind of people who at the time were called the &ldquo;Zille milieu&rdquo; after the popular drawings of the &ldquo;common people&rdquo; created by illustrator Heinrich Zille.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;New woman&rdquo; and the ballroom sisters </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cl&auml;rchen remarries in 1929, two years after the death of her first husband Fritz B&uuml;hler. She&rsquo;s still the boss of the ballroom, organising the day-to-day business and running the restaurant with an iron fist. Employees describe her as ambitious, determined and assertive &ndash; the qualities needed by businesswomen in a man&rsquo;s world. The 1920s sees the first cracks starting to appear in this world as women gain the right to vote and new horizons open up thanks to better employment and educational opportunities. Other changes are also afoot. New fashions such as the bob haircut and dresses that can be worn without a corset create new images of women that are disseminated in the media, arts and culture.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clara B&uuml;hler also cuts her hair, and she decides to create some female solidarity. She regularly meets up with other women who run ballrooms and dance halls &ndash; and they become known as the &ldquo;ballroom sisters&rdquo;. These meetings are useful for sharing ideas and providing mutual support. They also provide the women with a welcome breather in their busy lives, which are otherwise devoted to providing their guests with a good time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>Fanfares echo around Hardenbergstra&szlig;e as the guests arrive for the gala performance. It&rsquo;s 23 October 1931 &ndash; the German premiere of the film <em>Der Kongress tanzt </em>at the Ufa-Palast am Zoo cinema. This musical comedy directed by Erik Charell is one of the very first films with sound. Production costs have run into the millions, and it features lavish costumes and sets. Thousands flock to the Berlin premiere, only to be disappointed when they are turned away.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>The world premiere was held a few days earlier in Vienna &ndash; the film is, after all, about the Congress of Vienna &ndash; and it flopped. To prevent such a fiasco from happening again in Berlin, Ufa spends 30,000 Reichsmarks on advertising. The two leads, Lilian Harvey and Willy Fritsch, are also invited to appear at the gala performance. Ufa&#39;s strategy pays off and the glamorous premiere is a glittering success.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Illuminated organs and air conditioning, neo-Romanesque and Baroque </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ufa-Palast am Zoo cinema stood on approximately the same site as the present Zoo Palast cinema, which opened in 1957. The exterior of the old Ufa-Palast was anything but modern. Forming part of the square that is sometimes called the &ldquo;Romanesque Forum&rdquo;, it was built in a similar neo-Romanesque style to the Memorial Church. Behind the medieval-looking fa&ccedil;ade was an auditorium that could accommodate over 2,000 guests. The visual splendour was enhanced by a golden curtain and an illuminated organ, which projected coloured lights into the auditorium.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ufa-Palast is the flagship premiere cinema owned by Universum Film AG, or Ufa for short. But it is not the only grand cinema in the vicinity. The Capitol cinema opened in 1925, right next to the Ufa-Palast, on the spot where the Bikinihaus building stands today. Hans Poelzig&#39;s new building had a simple, modern exterior and a colourful interior with air conditioning to ensure the comfort of cinemagoers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1926 saw the opening of another cinema, the Gloria-Palast. It was located next to the Memorial Church, on the site of the new Upper West skyscraper that opened in 2017. Like the Ufa-Palast, the exterior was neo-Romanesque, while the auditorium reminded the journalist Eugen Szatmari &quot;more of an intimate little court theatre of the Baroque era than a 1927 cinema&rdquo;. <sup>1</sup> The premiere of <em>The Blue Angel</em> with Marlene Dietrich and Emil Jannings in the lead roles was held here in April 1930.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Costume drama with catchy tunes </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The popularity of <em>Der Kongress tanzt</em> continued after its premiere and it became the most successful film of 1931.The story of the Russian Tsar who courts a glove saleswoman clearly appealed to filmgoers. The film was shot three times &not;&ndash; in German, English and French &ndash; because dubbing hadn&rsquo;t yet been invented. Lilian Harvey appears in all the different versions, whereas Willy Fritsch can only be seen in the German version, as he can&rsquo;t speak any other languages. The film is still remembered to this day, mainly because of the song <em>Das gibt&rsquo;s nur einmal</em>.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>In Berlin in 1924, fans of the popular large-scale revue shows are spoilt for choice. Three competing revue theatres are set close to one another, on opposite banks of the River Spree near Friedrichstra&szlig;e station. The Admiralspalast theatre, under operetta director Hermann Haller, is showing the sparkling <em>Noch und Noch</em>. The Komische Oper theatre is home to James Klein&rsquo;s scintillating <em>Das hat die Welt noch nicht gesehen</em>. But both these are topped by Erik Charell&rsquo;s revue <em>An alle</em> in the largest and most spectacular theatre &ndash; the Gro&szlig;es Schauspielhaus.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p><strong>A cavernous auditorium &ndash; complete with stalactites</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, a large new apartment block occupies the site where the Gro&szlig;es Schauspielhaus once stood to the north of Bertolt-Brecht-Platz. In its first life, the Gro&szlig;es Schauspielhaus is a market hall, and then a circus arena. After the First World War, architect Hans Poelzig transforms the building into a sensational expressionist theatre seating 3000. The pillars and the massive domed auditorium are impressively decorated with thousands of stylised stalactites. The Gro&szlig;es Schauspielhaus is in a stable of theatres managed by impresario Max Reinhardt. In 1924, when dancer and choreographer Erik Charell is appointed stage manager, his shows start breaking box-office records.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Spectacular themed revues &ndash; a sensual mix of music and dance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Charell&rsquo;s large-scale revue shows include stunning stage sets and a good shot of music and dance. Entertaining short scenes and acts are loosely linked by an overarching theme. Large ensemble dance numbers alternate with solo stars from variety theatre or cabaret. The fast-moving revue shows present a rapid succession of comedians, acrobats, singers, and &ldquo;tableau vivants&rdquo; (&ldquo;living pictures&rdquo;) with elaborate costumes and stage settings to match. Audiences are equally fascinated and puzzled by troupes of female show dancers moving rhythmically in precision, often emulating routines developed by the Tiller Girls, the best-known dance troupe from London. These 1920s shows also incorporate popular American jazz music.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The harsh reality of competition</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diagonally opposite the Gro&szlig;es Schauspielhaus is the former Komische Oper, where James Klein stages his light-hearted revues. Klein is renowned for designing especially revealing costumes for his showgirls. Today, the Hotel Meli&aacute; stands on the site of the former Komische Oper. Only the Admiralspalast, directly next to the hotel, still exists today. In the 1920s, the Admiralspalast theatre is firmly in the hands of Hermann Haller. With many years of experience staging operettas, his revues are confidently stylish and tasteful. But Charell wins the battle of the revue show impresarios. The theatres under Haller and Klein run out of funds, bankrupt. In 1929, Charell revamps his programme to focus on operetta, ensuring his theatre remains successful &ndash; until 1933 and the Nazi seizure of power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To escape the Nazi regime, Erik Charell and Hermann Haller flee into exile. James Klein is murdered in Auschwitz. The Gro&szlig;es Schauspielhaus is renamed the Theater des Volkes (Theatre of the People). In keeping with Nazi policies, the amphitheatre&rsquo;s expressionist design with stylised &ldquo;stalactites&rdquo; is removed, and a special VIP theatre box built for Hitler. After the Second World War, the theatre reopens as the Friedrichstadtpalast. In the 1980s, the old theatre building is closed and demolished. A new Friedrichstadt-Palast is built just around the corner in Friedrichstra&szlig;e, opening in 1984. In front of the Friedrichstadt-Palast, there is a memorial to the theatre&rsquo;s founding figures Erik Charell, Max Reinhardt and Hans Poelzig.</p>\r\n",

They also offer a special competition, open to everyone keen on testing their own detective skills. At the entrance, visitors are given a flyer describing three wanted men. The task is to find these three men in the festival crowds &ndash; and win a top prize of a stately 1000 Marks.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>To enter the Luna Park, you first pass the monumental entrance gate on Kurf&uuml;rstendamm boulevard. Then you follow a narrow colonnade down towards the main restaurant - the Terraces at Halensee. From the tower at the Terraces, you have a panoramic view of the amusement park&rsquo;s attractions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Spoilt for choice</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While visitors try to spot the three wanted men, they can enjoy a wide range of rides and amusements &ndash; from bumper cars to little boats on a water slide into Halensee lake, or dancing to jazz music. On the Devil&rsquo;s Wheel, a spinning circular platform, the riders slide off as its speed gradually increases, or you can wobble your way down the Shimmy Staircase, divided into two offset tiers of shaking stairs. Visitors can also enjoy concerts, eat in the Terraces restaurant or carouse to their heart&rsquo;s content in the Bavarian village. The highlight of the evening&rsquo;s entertainment is a firework display.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An amusement park needs a varied programme to regularly draw the crowds. Every year, the Luna Park management offer new, sensational attractions. In summer 1924, for instance, the amusement park launches a prize draw &ndash; with top prizes including cars and even a house in the country. In 1926, the Luna Park boasts an escalator &ndash; one of the first in Berlin. That same summer, the amusement park also hosts a boxing match won by Max Schmeling, then unknown but later world heavyweight champion. At Luna Park, Schmeling needs just three minutes to win by a knock-out. In 1927, the big attraction is a wave pool. The Luna Pool is Berlin&rsquo;s first fun and wave pool, but also a venue for serious competitions. In summer 1928, the wooden roller-coaster is given its most modern setting &ndash; a skyscraper city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Who are these three men?&rdquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As newspapers report, the police summer festival attracts thousands of visitors &ndash; though crowds of that size are not an exception at the Luna Park. In warm summer weather and with their special events, the amusement park often draws crowds of 50,000 to 60,000. The main restaurant can serve over 7,000 guests at any one time. With such teeming crowds and a wealth of attractions, no one manages to identify all three of the wanted men. But at least one visitor goes away as a happy second place winner. The prize is awarded in the presence of the Wilhelm Abegg, State Secretary of the Interior, and Bernhard Wei&szlig;, Berlin&rsquo;s deputy Chief Constable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In autumn 1933, the Luna Park closes its gates for the last time. Today, the amusement park on Halensee lake has disappeared without trace &ndash; and not solely due to poor business decisions. Luna Park certainly suffered after the global economic crisis, but it was also on a site in the way of the Nazi regime&rsquo;s bombastic urban masterplan. If you visit Halensee today, you can see the result of that plan from the Trabener Steg &ndash; thousands of cars roaring past where once thousands celebrated.</p>\r\n",

There&rsquo;s not a lot to see in Wedding, so Fabian visits the Nordpark funfair in M&uuml;llerstra&szlig;e. Nordpark is squeezed into a gap &ldquo;between old, solid tenement buildings&rdquo;, writes Erich K&auml;stner. When he gets there, it&rsquo;s in &ldquo;semi-darkness&rdquo;, the paths are &ldquo;sticky&rdquo; and many of the attractions are shoddy or not even running. It&rsquo;s true that Fabian meets a woman with whom he is destined to have a brief fling, but the trip to the funfair is not exactly an exciting adventure. The prevailing mood is one of sadness.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n",

They can be found in all of Berlin&rsquo;s poorer, working-class districts. In July 1925 Nordpark offers a riding track called the Hippodrome, sideshows, a swing ride, a carousel, shooting galleries and a wheel of fortune with sausages as prizes. Funfairs are particularly popular with children and teenagers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A harmless pleasure?&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But many journalists and child welfare organisations think they are anything but harmless. A broad alliance of educationalists, clergymen, youth welfare workers, social workers and police are united in their opposition to funfairs, calling them hotbeds of vice, squalor and immorality. They are particularly enraged by the games of chance and sideshow attractions. For their part, the showmen defend the entertainment they offer, saying the criticism reflects the paternalism and arrogance of the cultural elites.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A harmless clown? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nordpark is particularly popular with children, because its operator, Adolf Rautmann, is the creator of the much-loved clown Uncle Pelle. He delights younger guests at local festivals and fairs. Indeed, the Uncle Pelle character is so successful that Adolf Rautmann protects it by patent. Once the patent expires, other clowns carry on using the name Uncle Pelle until the Fifties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adolf Rautmann is not just a clown; he&rsquo;s also a businessman. He runs several fairgrounds and entertainment venues in Berlin and works hard to defend the interests of Berlin&rsquo;s showmen. But even seemingly harmless clowns have their political views. Adolf Rautmann was a card-carrying National Socialist from the early 1930s.</p>\r\n",

There&rsquo;s also a lost and found office and a meeting point for lost children.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Redevelopment in the style of the New Objectivity movement </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The near-catastrophe of the fire is seen as a good reason to work on extensive plans for redeveloping the lido. Martin Wagner, the new head of Berlin&rsquo;s municipal planning department, wants to provide the city&rsquo;s residents with more green spaces and sports facilities. He joins forces with architect Richard Ermisch to plan a &ldquo;cosmopolitan city lido&rdquo; that reflects the concepts of the New Objectivity movement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their plans don&rsquo;t all come to fruition, but the new Wannsee lido is completed in 1930 and is as big, modern and popular as ever. Gardens are laid out above the embankment and yellow brick buildings are built along the beach. There are changing rooms and sanitary facilities, colonnades offering protection from sun and rain, sports facilities, scenic walking trails, a row of shops and a new beach restaurant. Even today, the complex is considered a prime example of the New Objectivity style and a monument to the socio-political ambitions of the 1920s.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, peace doesn&rsquo;t always reign at the lido &ndash; the growing political tensions even find their way to the beach. In the summer of 1930, the Nazis provoke several mass brawls. In March 1933, the director of the lido, Hermann Clajus, finds himself faced with imminent dismissal and arrest. He commits suicide.</p>\r\n",

It&rsquo;s a question that matters, because tickets for the mirror room are cheaper, and we&rsquo;re on the border between Kreuzberg and Neuk&ouml;lln, two working-class districts where people have to watch the pennies.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>The cinema&rsquo;s particular layout on the first floor of a corner building and its location in a working-class neighbourhood gave the owners an idea. Filmgoers can choose between two screening rooms. If you opt for the larger auditorium, you watch the film in the normal way at regular admission prices. But if you want to save a little cash you can opt for the mirror room, which is built at an angle to the main auditorium and located behind the screen. The screen itself is made of translucent silk batiste, so the audience in the mirror room can also watch the film, but the images are back to front.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mirror technology with a catch </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the advent of the talkies around 1930, it didn&rsquo;t matter too much whether the audience saw the images the right way round or back to front. But silent movies had captions to explain the plot and reading them the wrong way round was a little more challenging! The answer was to install a mirror to turn the images and text back the right way. So if you don&#39;t mind the film being a little paler, the sound a little quieter and the actors acting back to front, you can save your hard-earned dough by buying a ticket for the mirror room.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Neighbourhood cinemas </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today&#39;s Moviemento is the oldest cinema still in existence in Berlin. Films have been shown here since 1907. In the 1920s, most modern cinemas were specifically designed to show the latest films after lavish premieres. But other cinemas opened all over the city in former shops and apartments, in dance halls and ballrooms, in courtyards and side buildings &ndash; basically in spaces that weren&rsquo;t designed to be cinemas. It meant that some of them had to get creative with mirrors &ndash; like today&rsquo;s Moviemento.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These cinemas usually attracted audiences from the immediate neighbourhood. Admission was cheap, the audience didn&rsquo;t have to travel far, and the films were not necessarily the latest releases. The audience tended to take a few more liberties than they do today, often eating, drinking and smoking during the film and passing loud comments about what was happening on the screen. Many of them also used the neighbourhood cinemas as places to keep warm in winter or to escape from their cramped homes, and young couples had somewhere to cuddle under cover of darkness. The film itself &ndash; whether back to front or not &ndash; was not necessarily the main attraction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>In 1929, German writer Alfred D&ouml;blin vividly describes construction work on the square in his bestseller <em>Berlin Alexanderplatz</em>: &ldquo;Boom, boom, the steam pile-driver thumps in front of Aschinger&rsquo;s on the Alex. It&rsquo;s one story high, and knocks the rails into the ground as if they were nothing at all.&rdquo; <sup>1 </sup>D&ouml;blin&rsquo;s main protagonist Franz Biberkopf, just released from prison, finds it hard to cope with the freedom of a modern metropolis where everything around him is in flux. Here, fiction is a true reflection of reality &ndash; Alexanderplatz has always been a place of vibrant change.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>In the 1920s, the main impetus for this change comes from Martin Wagner, Berlin&rsquo;s chief city planner. He knows, &ldquo;A city square for a metropolis of world rank is no small-town project.&rdquo; <sup>2 </sup>This central square in the poor east of the city is threatening to dissolve into permanent gridlock. Wagner envisages Alexanderplatz as a circulatory system for modern traffic flows. Work begins in 1927 &ndash; underground. Here, at depths of up to 12 metres, a new interchange station is constructed for two new tube lines &ndash; today&rsquo;s Line 8 from Gesundbrunnen to Neuk&ouml;lln and Line 5 to Friedrichsfelde. With the tube lines laid from the street, this operation is rather like open heart surgery. For five years, Alexanderplatz is transformed into a massive construction site, leaving pedestrians to weave their way across the square on a series of wooden planks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alexanderplatz goes American</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chief city planner Martin Wagner wants a vast circular traffic system around Alexanderplatz, regulating the flow of cars and trams. He announces an architectural competition for the new buildings to line the redesigned square, encouraging some of the great names in modernist architecture to take part. But the financing is still not secured. Only when a US consortium of investors shows interest can his plan move forward. Star architect Peter Behrens, designer of many major buildings for industrial giant AEG, is awarded second place in the competition &ndash; and ultimately the contact as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Behrens first plans a series of skyscrapers of 20 to 30 floors high. In the end, though, he reduces his grand plan to two eight-storey office blocks. Built between 1929 and 1932, those blocks are named Alexander House and Berolina House. They still here today, on either side of the renowned <em>Weltzeituhr</em> &ndash; the World Time Clock. Behrens&rsquo; rigorously symmetrical facades are inspired by the New Objectivity movement. Instead of ornamental elements, he adds two rows of projecting windows on the sides. And visitors to the caf&eacute;s on the top floors could also enjoy roof terraces, the ideal setting for a concert of swing music. As the local Berliner Tageblatt newspaper noted: &ldquo;Both these office and apartment blocks have been built by an American company with American money, and since money is no object, they have also been completed at an American pace.&rdquo; <sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bread rolls for free</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two blocks designed by Peter Behrens replace two places much loved by the locals. Alexander House is constructed on the site of the old K&ouml;nigst&auml;dtische Theater, which housed a branch of the popular Aschinger restaurant and beer-hall chain. All the beers cost the same price &ndash; just ten pfennigs. The food is also similarly affordable &ndash; and all meals come with unlimited bread rolls for free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Berolina House is named after a statue of the Berolina, the female personification of Berlin, which formerly stood on the site. The majestic bronze female figure is again put up on Alexanderplatz in 1933. But just eleven years later, in 1944, it is melted down to fuel the war machinery. With the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, Alexanderplatz&rsquo;s urban modernist development is abruptly halted. Yet even today, the two office and apartment blocks by Peter Behrens and the Alexanderplatz tube station recall the hopes and dreams of the 1920s.</p>\r\n",

Now it is due to celebrate its grand reopening on 31 August 1928. But one thing is missing &ndash; a play. None of Berlin&rsquo;s top playwrights has anything ready.

"mainText": "<p><strong>A back-room encounter </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aufricht&rsquo;s last hope lies with the Schlichter restaurant in Lutherstra&szlig;e, a popular haunt of the artistic set. When he steps into the back room, he spots a small man in a grey suit, sitting smoking a cigar. The man is Berthold Brecht. He starts to tells the young theatre producer about a play he&rsquo;s working on. Aufricht is familiar with Brecht and his poems, but he doesn&rsquo;t like the sound of this particular play. But just as they are leaving, Brecht mentions that he is also working on an adaptation of John Gay&#39;s <em>Beggar&#39;s Opera</em>. A revival of the 200-year-old ballad opera has been playing to packed houses in London and has just been translated into German. Brecht interprets this play, set in London&rsquo;s underworld, as a critique of capitalism and gives it the title <em>Gesindel</em>, meaning scum or riffraff.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next day Aufricht reads the first pages of the manuscript and is hooked. He loves Brecht&rsquo;s bold approach, dry wit and the play&rsquo;s new epic style. He decides to stage it for his theatre&rsquo;s reopening. Brecht sets two conditions. First, Kurt Weill has to write the score, even though Aufricht is not keen on this atonal type of music. And secondly, he and Weill are to spend the summer on the French Riviera, along with their wives, at Aufricht&rsquo;s expense. In their retreat in Le Lavandou, the pair write the libretto and music for the <em>Threepenny Opera</em>, as Brecht now calls the piece.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Crazy August days&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rehearsals at the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm begin just four weeks before the premiere &ndash; and soon descend into chaos. Leading lady Carola Neher walks out. Brecht is constantly rewriting the script while exhausted actors sit and wait in the auditorium, sometimes until five in the morning. And Kurt Weill is furious because his girlfriend, Lotte Lenya, who plays &lsquo;Pirate Jenny&rsquo;, isn&rsquo;t even mentioned in the programme. Before the premiere Brecht says: &ldquo;This is the last time I&rsquo;m ever coming to this theatre.&rdquo; <sup>1&nbsp;</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Brecht is proved wrong. The <em>Threepenny Opera</em> premieres on 31 August 1928 and is an unexpected hit. At first the audience are a little unsure, but soon they are applauding enthusiastically and calling for encores of every song. The play that turns Brecht into a global star enjoys an uninterrupted run at the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm until it is banned by the Nazis in 1933. Brecht flees into exile. In 1954, six years after his return, he returns to the scene of his success when he takes over the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm and installs his own Berliner Ensemble.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>Its construction caused a sensation. Right here beneath your feet, the Excelsior tunnel was opened on 15 March 1928. It connected the city&#39;s biggest railway station with the continent&#39;s biggest hotel. So it&rsquo;s hardly surprising that the Hotel Excelsior dubbed the 80-metre-long tunnel from the station to its door &ldquo;the longest hotel tunnel in the world&rdquo;. It&#39;s all about the power of superlatives.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p><strong>From waiter to hotel manager </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was Curt Elschner who came up with the idea of the tunnel. He had worked his way up from lowly waiter to famous hotel manager. He bought the Hotel Excelsior in 1919. Today, a supermarket stands where its entrance used to be. Elschner decides to focus on attracting the masses rather than the upper classes. He gradually expands the hotel until it has 600 rooms and 750 beds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hotel&rsquo;s main draw is its proximity to Anhalter railway station across the road. Every day, 14,000 long-distance travellers pass through the station. He has the tunnel built so that it is even easier for guests to get to the hotel from the station. Gold-plated elevators whisk guests into the tunnel from the station concourse and hotel lobby. Elschner invested one million Reichsmarks of his own money in the project &ndash; a huge sum at the time. He also has to pay 10,000 Reichsmarks to the Reichsbahn, which operates the station.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A gateway to the world </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tunnel is first and foremost a publicity stunt. It receives extensive coverage in the Berlin dailies. The <em>Vossische Zeitung</em> points out that there is a ticket office at the entrance to the tunnel. This means hotel guests can buy their train tickets without having to set foot on Berlin&rsquo;s crowded streets. Then they can not only travel to the Free State of Anhalt, but also to Paris or Naples, as 120 long-distance trains pass through the station every day Its three sweeping arches provide a gateway to the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the tunnel is an economic disaster, as only 100 people use the underpass each day. The shops in the tunnel are operated by KaDeWe, but they prove difficult to let. Elschner fights for a discount, writing to the Reichsbahn: &ldquo;Unfortunately, the tunnel itself can be described as a failure as its use is virtually non-existent.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anhalter station is damaged during the war and comes to a complete standstill after 1945. It is eventually demolished, apart from the central portion of its facade. Allied bombers also reduce the Hotel Excelsior to a burning ruin. It is finally replaced by a 17-storey tower block, the Excelsiorhaus, which has nothing to do with the hotel apart from its name. The tunnel fades into oblivion until it is uncovered during construction works on Stresemannstra&szlig;e in 1985.

"introtext": "<p>On 6 June 1927, 150,000 people stream onto the Tempelhofer Feld. Only the fortunate few can realise the dream of flight, but wherever planes touch down, they quickly draw huge crowds. On Tempelhofer Feld, these aviation enthusiasts are waiting to welcome Clarence Chamberlin. His planned non-stop flight from New York to Berlin is front-page news. Accompanied by millionaire Charles Levine, Chamberlin hopes to break Lindbergh&rsquo;s record transatlantic flight just a few days before. But just short of Magdeburg, Chamberlin runs out of fuel. His single engine Wright-Bellanca WB-2, christened the <em>Columbia</em>, has to land near Eisleben. The massed crowd in Berlin waits in vain for the record-breaking plane.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>After refuelling the next day, Chamberlin manages to miss Berlin. He stops over in Cottbus and finally lands on Tempelhofer Feld to a rapturous reception. Sirens announce Chamberlin&rsquo;s imminent arrival. The crowd roars out a welcome when Miss Columbia, as the plane is nicknamed, appears on the horizon flanked by other aircraft. Two years later, the road past the Tempelhofer Feld is officially named Columbiadamm in honour of Chamberlin&rsquo;s plane.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The new airport</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, when you stand on the Tempelhofer Feld, you are on a vast park called the Tempelhofer Freiheit &ndash; &ldquo;Tempelhof Freedom&rdquo;. Here, in the heart of the city, you can look out across kilometres of this former airfield, now open parkland. There are just a few trees standing in the centre. Today, hardly anyone knows that this exact spot is the site of first Tempelhof Airport. Here, aviation history was written. For two hundred years, the Prussian Army uses this vast area as an exercise ground. In the early 1900s, aviation pioneers give their flying displays here. Then, on 8 October 1923, Tempelhofer Feld airport opens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In those early years, it&rsquo;s a modest operation with only a few hangers for planes. During the airport&rsquo;s first year, just 150 passengers fly out from the Tempelhofer Feld. No planes are allowed to start or land on Sundays, and since the aircraft are not heated, no passenger planes fly in winter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just a few years later, the world looks a very different place. The <em>Deutsche Luft Hansa Aktiengesellschaft</em> (German Air Hansa Company) makes Tempelhof its home airport. Finally, the airfield can boast a dark-red brick airport building. The signature feature is two red-and-white radio towers. Despite the paint, they still look remarkably like the Funkturm Radio Tower at Berlin&rsquo;s fairs and exhibitions ground &ndash; which is no surprise as they are designed by the same architect, Heinrich Straumer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Always against the wind</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1929, the airport building is finished &ndash; already much too small for the volume of air traffic. Plans are already made for a new building, later built under the Nazi regime. After the war, the first airport building disappears almost without trace. Today, only the Tempelhofer Freiheit park&rsquo;s round shape recalls the old airport. With these early aircraft always having to start into the wind, the first airfield only has a circular grassed area and not concrete runways. In this way, these light propeller aircraft were free to start in any direction &ndash; a tradition of freedom still thriving on today&rsquo;s Tempelhofer Freiheit park.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>An act of sabotage? No, it&rsquo;s all about improving road safety. On the evening of 20 October 1924 a team of men arrive in Potsdamer Platz. They cut the overhead tram lines and start digging up the track. The next morning, a five-sided steel structure rises above the square&rsquo;s central island. Berlin has its very first traffic lights &ndash; and a new attraction for sightseers.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>The new technology has been introduced to combat the traffic chaos that reigns on Potsdamer Platz. Electric trams have crossed the square since the turn of the century. But now they have been joined by a lot more cars. People take their lives in their hands trying to get across the intersection. Travel guides warn children and the elderly about the dangers of Europe&#39;s busiest square.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Inspiration from America </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the summer of 1924, the Berlin tram company turns to America for ideas. A delegation is sent to New York, where they marvel at the new traffic lights on Fifth Avenue. The Berliners shell out 10,000 Reichsmarks to buy the plans for the American traffic light tower and return home. The architect Jean Kr&auml;mer is commissioned to build a similar tower in the middle of Potsdamer Platz. The firm of Siemens &amp; Halske installs the system, with the traffic lights displayed horizontally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Berliners have to get used to the significance of the colours: red means stop, green means go and white means that pedestrians can cross the square. A policeman is clearly visible inside the turret. He is there to control the system &ndash; and ensure people obey the lights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>From source of irritation to popular photo subject </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first the traffic lights have plenty of critics. Kurt Tucholsky thinks they are ridiculous and taxi passengers want them removed because taxi drivers keep their meters running when the lights are at red. But the Berliners gradually accept the traffic lights and they become a favourite with photographers. Tourists and locals make the pilgrimage to Potsdamer Platz. In 1929, in his popular guide for walks around the city, Franz Hessel describes the intersection as follows: &ldquo;In the middle stands the famous traffic light tower, watching over the game in the streets like an umpire&rsquo;s chair at a tennis match&rdquo;. <sup>1&nbsp;</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a few years the traffic light tower becomes obsolete. In 1937 it is demolished to make way for the construction of the north-south suburban railway line. But the memory of the traffic light system survives the test of time. When Potsdamer Platz is redesigned in 1997, a replica of the tower is erected a few metres from its original location, and once again it is Siemens that installs the lights. Today it no longer controls the traffic but acts as an iconic reminder of the 1920s.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>&ldquo;This palm tree stands on the beach of poverty, and in its shade there is little happiness.&rdquo; <sup>1 </sup>This is how journalist Max Barthel describes the municipal homeless shelter in Fr&ouml;belstra&szlig;e in January 1929. Dating back to imperial times, the brick fortress is feared by most Berliners. Nobody wants to sink so low that they have to sleep at the &ldquo;Palm&rdquo;, as the homeless shelter is called because of the exotic plant that grows at its entrance.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>Day in, day out, a long queue of homeless people forms at the shelter, waiting for it to open its doors at 3 o&rsquo;clock. They are mainly men: &ldquo;young lads and old hobos, forced to live as beggars for decades, the derelicts of bourgeois society&rdquo;. This is how they are described in the communist newspaper, the <em>Red Flag</em>. <sup>2 </sup>The queue is also full of people who have ended up on the street because they can&rsquo;t pay their rent. Many of them have simply given up hope.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Police checks </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the reception area, it&rsquo;s like a military barracks. The homeless have to salute the staff on duty. Most of them still display the Prussian mentality that equates homelessness with crime. Each new arrival is carefully checked for a criminal record, and the police keep a close eye on the homeless shelter. Anyone who wants a bed for the night has their neck stamped and is told to strip to their underwear so that their clothes can be disinfected in the delousing room. Only then are they given their standard bowl of watery gruel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At 10 o&rsquo;clock, the doors of the &ldquo;Palm&rdquo; close for the night. That&rsquo;s when the moaning and groaning starts. Up to 70 men can be accommodated in each dormitory at the rear of the shelter. The main building has a few rooms for women and children. When times are tough, more than 5,000 people can be sleeping in the shelter. Fights break out constantly over people&rsquo;s meagre possessions. Sleep is often out of the question. The stench is almost unbearable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Into the unknown </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone is kicked out at six the next morning. Most of them don&rsquo;t know what to do or where to go and will end up back in the queue that afternoon. But they can&rsquo;t stay for longer than two weeks. This rule is spelled out to everyone who comes looking for a bed: &ldquo;You can only stay here for 14 days. During that time you have to find a job and somewhere to live.&rdquo; <sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For most of them, it&rsquo;s an impossible task. But if they try to stay longer than two weeks they run the risk of being sent to the notorious municipal workhouse in Rummelsburg. Once this happens, they have not only lost their home, but also their freedom.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

"mainText": "<p>Right here, at the entrance, the reporter spots a sign saying: &ldquo;Morgue open.&rdquo; When this sign appears on the old brick building it means another set of unidentified corpses is on show. There&rsquo;s no shortage of them in this anonymous city. Up to 14 bodies can be laid out side-by-side in the glass showcases. They are strapped to a table in a semi-upright position so that visitors can identify them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Like the zoo </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But they are only rarely identified. Instead, the morgue satisfies the Berliners&#39; morbid curiosity, as the journalist reports: &ldquo;Coachmen abandon their carriages in the street, schoolchildren try to sneak in, locals fetch their neighbours from nearby shops and houses to see the free show.&rdquo; <sup>1 </sup>With its glass roof and metal railings, the display area reminds Kisch of the predator house at the zoo. The visitors also behave as if they&rsquo;re at the zoo, describing the dead with typical Berlin bluntness: &ldquo;Look at him: he looks like a gorilla!&rdquo; <sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The morgue even becomes a tourist attraction. Taxi drivers proudly tell visitors to the city that it&rsquo;s a must-see. Sometimes things get out of hand and visitors are forcibly cleared from the display area.

During the Weimar Republic, this is where autopsies are carried out on prominent citizens who have met with a violent death &ndash; including Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, Walther Rathenau and Talaat Pascha. But less well-known people also end up in the Berlin morgue, such as the peace negotiators who were murdered during the occupation of the Vorw&auml;rts-building and the victims of the bloody riots of May 1929.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today the old morgue in Hannoversche Stra&szlig;e serves a completely different purpose. Since 2007, it has been dedicated to the study of antiquity. But the former display area in the central wing still holds the glass cases that made up this chamber of horrors.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>One winter evening in 1925, theology student Hans R&uuml;ckert sets out on a secret mission. Joined by a fellow student, his task is to travel deep into Friedrichshain, the working-class district in the east of Berlin. On behalf of their professor, the two students, dressed as workers, explore pubs and taverns along Fruchtstra&szlig;e - today&rsquo;s Stra&szlig;e der Pariser Kommune.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>In those days, the area has a very dubious reputation. Solidly working class, apartment blocks are set around dark courtyards, and innumerable pubs and taverns line the street. The professor and his students hope to wean the workers from alcohol, and inspire them to practice the Christian faith. First, though, they need an undercover look at the neighbourhood&rsquo;s licentious amusements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A walk along the entertainment district </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just under one kilometre long, the street has 32 pubs. On one evening, in the space of six hours, Hans R&uuml;ckert and his friend visit over half of them. They count nearly 300 people drinking there, mostly men escaping the cramped conditions at home. But they also meet cases for concern &ndash; young men in various states of drunkenness, some totally wasted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the <em>Eldorado-Diele</em> pub, the students can hardly believe their eyes. As the red light at the entrance clearly indicates, this is a pub with hostesses. They watch two hostesses encouraging guests to have one drink after another. Pushy and persistent, the women beg cigarettes and drinks &ndash; and one guest actually lets them wheedle him out of the incredible sum of 90 Reichsmark. In Berlin, as a hotbed of vice, unlimited freedom also leaves you free to follow the path to ruin. As far as we know, the two students&rsquo; visit to this twilight world had no further consequences &ndash; but unfortunately, no records exist on the outcome of their expedition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Extraordinary entertainment for ordinary folk </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pubs are not the only nightlife venues in this working-class neighbourhood. Exactly on this site, where today you can see the <em>Neues Deutschland</em> publishing house, the Plaza variety theatre opens 1 February 1929. In a former station building converted into a vast theatre, the Plaza is under the same management as Sch&ouml;neberg&rsquo;s renowned Scala variety theatre. The free-standing balcony with 820 seats is a sensation. The Plaza can seat a total of 3000 people to experience, as the theatre programme promises, &ldquo;the biggest line-up of the highest artistry at the lowest prices&rdquo;. <sup>1&nbsp; </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Plaza, such stars as popular entertainer and singer Claire Waldoff plays to huge audiences. In the meantime, the working class in Friedrichshain has more leisure and a little more money and can afford such pleasures. But in autumn 1929, the financial world is shaken to its roots. On Black Friday, Berlin is also sucked into the maelstrom of the global economic crisis. The Plaza is forced to close temporarily, and reopens as an operetta theatre. The Nazi regime dispossesses the Jewish owners, and later turns the theatre into a venue for their own <em>Kraft durch Freude (Strength through Joy)</em> leisure organisation. Now, the amusements in the neighbourhood are directed to war preparations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>It&rsquo;s September 1919, barely a year after the end of the First World War. Electricity and building materials are scarce. Despite this, Decla, a film production company, is building a film set in Wei&szlig;ensee and invites the press to visit the shoot. Decla even covers the cost of the journalists&rsquo; taxis and provides them with sandwiches. They&rsquo;re shooting a crowd scene &ndash; a procession through medieval Florence.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>The journalists thank the production company for its generosity by writing effusive articles praising the elaborate set and professional film work. The producer of the epic film <em>The Plague in Florence</em> is Erich Pommer. The plot is unrestrainedly theatrical, and the film turns out to be a box office flop. But just a few months later, Pommer produces a film that is destined to become a classic of silent cinema: <em>The Cabinet of Dr Caligari</em>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Shooting silent movies in Wei&szlig;ensee </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1920s Wei&szlig;ensee is known as Little Hollywood. Dozens of silent movies are shot at the many major film studios that set up shop here between 1913 and 1928. They include detective films, historical dramas &ndash; and the expressionist classic about the scary Doctor Caligari. The film studios are located on Franz-Joseph-Stra&szlig;e, today&#39;s Liebermannstra&szlig;e. A small square in Wei&szlig;ensee now bears the name Caligariplatz in memory of the many films that were made there.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ten years after the shooting of <em>The Plague in Florence</em>, a new cinema opens on Caligariplatz. The exterior of the Delphi cinema is fairly plain &ndash; only a pyramid-shaped neon sign with the slanting Delphi lettering adorns the smooth plaster of its almost windowless fa&ccedil;ade. The Delphi is a large cinema. The auditorium has seating for 900 people in the stalls and circle, and the screen is framed by three impressive stucco arches.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The talkies take over </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Delphi opens in Wei&szlig;ensee, the silent movie era is already coming to an end. In reality, the films were never truly silent. Before sound films were invented, the screenings were accompanied by orchestras, pianists or mechanical musical instruments. Sometimes a narrator provided a running commentary on the plot. The talkies made a breakthrough in Germany in 1930 with the release of two classic early sound films <em>Die drei von der Tankstelle</em> and <em>Der blaue Engel.</em> However, these new films weren&rsquo;t shot in Wei&szlig;ensee, but at the film studios in Babelsberg. The Delphi also has to adapt to the new era and start showing films with sound.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike many cinemas in Berlin, the Delphi survives the war largely unscathed. But it later falls into disrepair and closes in 1959.Over the years, its foyer is used as a vegetable store, a stamp shop and a laundry. Since 2013, the listed building has served as a venue for independent cultural events &ndash; and as a location for film and TV. In the series <em>Babylon Berlin</em> it provides the backdrop for the dance scenes at Moka Efti.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>A crisp late autumn morning. On 5 November 1923, thousands of Berlin&rsquo;s unemployed gather outside Gormannstra&szlig;e 13. They&rsquo;ve heard the employment exchange is paying out benefits. During these crisis-ridden years after the First World War, poverty is rife in Berlin. Hyperinflation reaches its peak &ndash; with a loaf of bread costing 80 billion Reichsmark.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p><strong>Anti-Semitic agitators in the crowd </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Towards 11 o&rsquo;clock, officials at the employment exchange announce there will be no benefit payments. The crowd&rsquo;s anger is palpable. With people looking for someone to blame, populist agitators find it only too easy to stir up anti-Semitic feeling. They fuel the anger by claiming that Jews from the Scheunenviertel district have bought up the entire stock of stable-value currency available for emergencies. At that time, the Scheunenviertel is home to many Eastern European Jews, a group many locals long view with suspicion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon, a furious mob is on the move, going from house to house, looting apartments and businesses of the Jews living there &ndash; just like the Peretz cigar shop, here at Gormannstra&szlig;e 24 on the corner of Mulackstra&szlig;e. The rioters attack anyone they think looks Jewish, sometimes literally stealing the clothes off the backs of their victims. For a long time, the police only watch and wait, without intervening.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Organised riots </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The riots and looting start around noon and spread to many city districts. But the events in the Scheunenviertel district are not a riot, but a pogrom. The violence is well-organised. Far from being a spontaneous outbreak of anger, this is an action orchestrated by several hundred supporters of the populist nationalist movement. The violence is coordinated from outside the Scheunenviertel district using bike patrols warning of approaching police and updating on current developments. Anti-Semitic attacks also take place in other German cities, such as Nuremberg and Oldenburg. And in Munich just a few days later, on 9 November 1923, Hitler makes his first attempt to seize power in what becomes known as the &lsquo;Beer Hall Putsch&rsquo;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Accusations against the police&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Berlin, around 20 members of an association of First World War German-Jewish veterans spontaneously seek to protect the Eastern European Jews. They face the mob in Linienstra&szlig;e at the junction to B&uuml;lowplatz square. A packed police vehicle ignores their calls for help. Soon, they have to fear for their own lives. In the scuffle, one of the assailants is shot. The uniformed police arrest the Jewish veterans. They are taken to the courtyard at the Alexanderplatz police station, and on their way there, kicked and beaten. Max Domei, head of the police unit, shouts out: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll show you Jew-boys.&rdquo; <sup>1 </sup>A police superintendent threatens to have them stringed up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the following day, the newspapers write of pogrom-style riots. The charges against the police involved lead to fines and prison sentences, all waived a little later. The damage is considerable &ndash; just as it is in the Peretz cigar shop. The calm after the end of hyperinflation turns out to be deceptive. But the Scheunenviertel district pogrom is already a harbinger of the reign of terror under the Nazi regime which, ten years later, destroys Jewish life in Berlin.</p>\r\n",

"mainText": "<p>A gang of kids rushes past after pinching an apple from the fruit crates on the street. Deep in conversation, small groups of Orthodox Jews in kaftans make their way to prayers. Tuneless singing drifts out of the open doors and windows. Make way &ndash; get off the road! A police car is trying to get through. You leap onto the pavement. Why is it so narrow? What&rsquo;s going on? It&rsquo;s 1928 and you&rsquo;re in Berlin&rsquo;s Scheunenviertel, the &ldquo;barn district&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Jews from the East never go to Berlin of their own accord.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 30 barns that gave the district its name have disappeared by the late 19th century when the first Jews arrive from Eastern Europe. Berlin is the halfway point between the major ports of Amsterdam and Hamburg and the ships that are meant to carry them to New York. But many end up staying in Berlin. They are all trying to escape &ndash; from the misery of the &ldquo;shtetls&rdquo;, the Jewish settlements in Poland, Galicia and Romania; from the hostility and pogroms of the Tsarist empire and later the violence of the Bolsheviks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These Jews have many different reasons for coming to Berlin, but a single reason for staying here. They can&rsquo;t move on without money. In the Scheunenviertel they establish kosher shops and restaurants, set up prayer schools, open theatres and start to dream of living their lives in freedom. They turn the Scheunenviertel into a unique cultural area &ndash; a small town, a shtetl, in the big city.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Poverty stalks the streets </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jews from the East make up about a third of the population of this district. Conditions are tough, with people packed together like sardines. Many apartments are home to several families, with people living in cellars and attics. Many of the buildings predate the construction of the sewage system, so their residents have to go into the backyard to answer the call of nature. Let&rsquo;s hope it hasn&rsquo;t frozen up again. The nights are pitch black. Electric lights are few and far between and the gas lamps only provide a dim glow.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The streets are full of deadbeats and scroungers. Mishket, the daughter of Rabbi Liebermann, describes them as follows: &ldquo;They were everywhere. They all had a particular family who they took money off each month.&rdquo; <sup>2</sup> Then there are the people with no money but lots of &ldquo;ideas&rdquo;. And, of course, the prostitutes, keys in hand, promising their potential clients a quiet spot in which to do their business.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the corner of Hirtenstra&szlig;e stands Silberberg butcher&#39;s shop. During the Scheunenviertel pogrom of November 1923, this brave butcher did what he could to protect his fellow Jewish citizens. But ten years later, no one can save the Jews from the East. The Nazis wipe out Jewish life in Berlin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, when you walk down Almstadtstra&szlig;e, there are few reminders of this bustling Grenadierstra&szlig;e. But most traces of its misery and poverty have also disappeared.</p>\r\n",

"mainText": "<p>The workers are responding to calls from the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD), the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and the Berlin trade unions to demonstrate against the proposed new Works Council Act. They want the councils to give them more say. The demonstrators are carrying banners saying: &ldquo;Ebert, keep your promise!&rdquo; and waving red flags. Officials make speeches on a stage in front of the steps of the Reichstag.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The situation escalates at the Victory Column </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Police chief Eugen Ernst is standing at Portal II on the south side of the parliament building, surrounded by some of his 300 officers. He watches nervously as the situation starts to escalate. The job of the security police is to protect the members of the Reichstag, who are currently discussing the proposed new Works Council Act. No one is allowed into the Reichstag, and that includes a delegation of demonstrators. Some SPD members of the Reichstag are heckled as they make their way into the building.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around 3pm, one or two demonstrators try to incite the crowd to push up the huge flight of steps in front of the West Portal. Fights break out at the Bismarck Memorial as they move ever closer to the entrance. Some of the police lose their handguns. They had earlier tried to calm the tense situation by removing the machine guns, but now they reinstall them here and at the South Portal. One demonstrator fires towards the entrance with a stolen weapon. He is knocked to the ground by his fellow protesters.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Politicians debate while people are dying </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly the rat-a-tat of a machine gun rings out. Hand grenades explode. The police open fire. On the south side of Simsonstra&szlig;e, today&rsquo;s Scheidemannstra&szlig;e, several people fall to the ground under a hail of bullets. Locksmith Otto Heinig is one of the victims, hit by a bullet to the head. Worker Reinhold H&ouml;pfner is killed by a shot to the neck. The crowd starts to flee as the gunfire continues. In the end, 42 people, including a policeman, lose their lives. 105 people are also injured, some seriously.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first the politicians inside the Reichstag are unaware of what is happening outside. However, USPD representative Fritz Zubeil, watches the massacre unfold from the entrance and runs into the chamber, calling for the debate to be stopped. Reichstag President Constantin Fehrenbach suspends the sitting several times. In the meantime, the dead and injured are carried into the Reichstag and laid in the corridors. When the Reichstag eventually votes against stopping the debate, a riot breaks out. USPD members chant &ldquo;enough, enough, enough.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup> Fehrenbach finally suspends the sitting when he realises the seriousness of the situation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People are quick to blame the USPD, who they believe provoked the massacre. But it&rsquo;s still unclear to this day why the police decided to shoot and whether they fired any warning shots. The Works Council Act is finally passed and shatters the council movement&rsquo;s hopes of establishing a soviet-style republic in Germany.</p>\r\n",

At the bar, they order a round of beer. Hardly have they finished their drinks before they start beating up two carpenters. What looks like a spontaneous pub fight is a deliberate attack. Over the course of the night, it develops into Berlin&rsquo;s biggest ever free-for-all. The opposing sides comprise 50 carpenters from Hamburg and 150 members of Berlin&rsquo;s criminal underworld &ndash; the so-called <em>Ringvereine</em> that control the city&rsquo;s night life.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p><strong>Escalation after midnight </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The carpenters, all members of the same artisan guild, have long been a thorn in the side of the city&rsquo;s underworld. In those days, Berlin crime syndicates often set up legal ex-convict wrestling associations called Ringvereine (literally: &lsquo;ring associations&rsquo;) to front their activities, including protection money. But now just the strong physical presence of the carpenters in some bars spoils business for the <em>Immertreu (Always Loyal)</em> association and its boss Adolf Leib, nicknamed Muscle Adolf. Some pub landlords become mutinous, no longer willing to pay protection money to Leib. In a pub brawl the day before, one of the carpenters badly injured a member of the <em>Norden (North)</em> association &ndash; giving Muscle Adolf a reason to teach the Hamburg carpenters a lesson.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By chance, Muscle Adolf and his men in their elegant tuxedos are just on the way back from the funeral of one of their gang when they receive a tip-off. The obstreperous carpenter from the day before has been seen in the <em>Armelien </em>pub in Breslauer Stra&szlig;e &ndash; the carpenters&rsquo; regular. The idea is to take the man away, but his fellow carpenters defend him tooth and claw, driving off Muscle Adolf and his cronies. When everything is over, the police are alerted, come by and take a look at the scene.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just one hour and one telephone call later, around 15 cars packed with members of the <em>Immertreu </em>and <em>Norden </em>associations are heading for the area looking for trouble. What follows is a free-for-all, Berlin&rsquo;s largest ever street brawl. In the end, Muscle Adolf&rsquo;s gang draw their guns. The carpenter Paul M&ouml;rlitz is killed by a bullet in the head. The pub is wrecked during the fight, as is <em>Leos Hof</em>, the Ringverein meeting point opposite.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Acquittal in Moabit </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The police arrest Muscle Adolf. At the Moabit Criminal Court, he is given ten months on probation &ndash; more or less an acquittal. The witnesses, bribed and intimidated, staunchly refuse to testify. But Muscle Adolf&rsquo;s spell of freedom does not last &ndash; in 1934, the Nazi regime arrest him as a &ldquo;professional criminal&rdquo;. He is interned in a concentration camp, where he is thought to have been murdered.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Chicago-style conditions? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the trial, the media spotlight is on the <em>Ringvereine</em>. Berlin&rsquo;s Chief of Police Karl Friedrich Z&ouml;rgiebel plays down the incident, only talking of a major brawl, nothing comparable to the armed street fights in Chicago.<sup> 1 </sup>Z&ouml;rgiebel sees a far greater threat in the two paramilitary organisations of the Nazi&rsquo;s SA and the Communist&rsquo;s RFB. Although the <em>Immertreu </em>association is banned before the trial, the ban has to be lifted afterwards. The police continue to make only half-hearted efforts to pursue the <em>Ringvereine</em>, Berlin&rsquo;s world of organised crime. Perhaps they saw the premiere of Bertolt Brecht&rsquo;s <em>Threepenny Opera</em> in August in the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm? In it, Mac the Knife recommends: &ldquo;Injustice should be spared from persecution. Soon it will freeze to death, for it is cold.&rdquo;</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>Instead of a huge pink shopping centre, Berliners walking down Dircksenstra&szlig;e in the 1920s are faced with another massive building &ndash; Berlin&#39;s police headquarters, known as the<em> Red Castle</em> because of its red brick fa&ccedil;ade.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>This building houses all the departments of the Prussian police force. It is where the famous criminologist Ernst Gennat reorganises how homicides are investigated. And it is from here that a brave deputy chief fights a determined campaign against enemies of the Republic.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The stronghold of justice </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One question is preoccupying the people of Berlin: why is crime particularly prevalent in the area around the police HQ? Alexanderplatz is within sight of the building&rsquo;s massive corner tower, and behind that is the Scheunenviertel, a district that is known for its high levels of petty crime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Berlin police have a thankless task. Along with hunting down criminals, they have to contain the political violence that flares up regularly around the city. This is becoming increasingly difficult, partly because of Joseph Goebbels, who arrives in Berlin by train on 7 November 1926. As Berlin&#39;s new <em>Gauleiter</em>, or regional party leader, his job is to win over <em>Red Berlin</em> for the National Socialists &ndash; by force if necessary.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This also involves a battle with the <em>Red Castle</em>. His path is blocked by the uncompromising Social Democrat Bernhard Wei&szlig;, who is appointed deputy chief of police shortly after Goebbel&#39;s arrival. On 5 May 1927, Wei&szlig; has the National Socialist German Workers&rsquo; Party (NSDAP) banned in Berlin following numerous violent clashes between the SA and local communists. As a result, Goebbels sets about defaming the Jewish deputy police chief in an unprecedented anti-Semitic smear campaign. In his newly founded newspaper <em>Der Angriff</em>, or <em>The Attack</em>, he repeatedly refers to Wei&szlig; as &ldquo;Isidor&rdquo; &ndash; an insulting anti-Semitic name.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The last bulwark of the Republic </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bernhard Wei&szlig; fights the Nazis in his professional capacity and also defends himself as a private citizen. He successfully brings a number of defamation charges against Goebbels. Case files start to pile up on Goebbels&rsquo; desk. The <em>Gauleiter </em>is on the verge of a nervous breakdown and notes in his diary that it makes him &ldquo;puke&rdquo;. <sup>1</sup> It is only his immunity as a member of the Reichstag since 1928 that affords him any protection.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 12 May 1932, Nazi members of parliament beat up an SPD member in the Reichstag restaurant. Wei&szlig; himself leads the subsequent police operation inside the parliament building. As soon as they spot him, the Nazis chant &ldquo;Isidor&rdquo;. Wei&szlig; criticises his superiors for not doing enough to defend democracy. In 1932 he believes Prussia is the last bulwark of the republic, and still defends it with a sense of optimism. But the bulwark crumbles.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government of the Reich overthrows the Prussian government in what becomes known as the Prussian coup. As a result, Wei&szlig; loses his job on 20 July 1932 and is forced to flee Berlin on 5 March 1933 when SA troops storm his apartment on Steinplatz. He escapes just in time and goes into exile with his wife &ndash; initially in Prague, and then in London. And the <em>Red Castle</em>, the proud headquarters of the Berlin police, is turned into a Nazi torture chamber.</p>\r\n",

It&rsquo;s yet another police raid on Karl-Liebknecht-Haus &ndash; the headquarters of the KPD, the Communist Party of Germany.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Crackdown on the Commies </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The security police set about searching the building where the KPD&rsquo;s newspaper, Die <em>Rote Fahne (The Red Flag)</em> is produced. Some of them head to the basement, where the massive printing press is churning out copies of the latest issue. Two openings have been made in the first floor to accommodate this huge machine. The police confiscate the materials being printed. The editorial offices of the Red Flag are on the second floor. The police once again search every nook and cranny for suspect materials. Arthur Gohlke, a member of the Reichstag, barricades himself in his office, but his struggle is futile and he is eventually arrested.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The raid is the result of suspicions that the KPD is trying to undermine the armed forces. A few weeks earlier, leaflets had appeared encouraging soldiers in the German army to mutiny. The KPD acquired the building on B&uuml;lowplatz on 30 July 1926, after it outgrew its old party headquarters on Rosenthaler Strasse. Since then, police raids have become commonplace.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>From eagle to red star </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Communists buy the factory building for nearly half a million Reichsmark from Vulkan GmbH, a company that sympathises with the KPD. They name it after their murdered former leader, Karl Liebknecht. At the time, the building is known as the Adlerhaus (the eagle building) because of the stone eagle perched on a globe on the gable facing Bartelstra&szlig;e. The architect Alfred Wilke redesigns the interior to suit the needs of its new owners. The Lenin Hall on the fourth floor can hold 150 people, and this is where the party&rsquo;s central committee will meet from now on. The office of party leader Ernst Th&auml;lmann is just around the corner, overlooking B&uuml;lowplatz. Th&auml;lmann occasionally walks over to the newspaper&rsquo;s office and tells the staff what stories to run. For example, he might ask for more reports about &ldquo;broken toilet seats&rdquo;, <sup>1 </sup>because workers in factories also have their day-to-day problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Trouble on B&uuml;lowplatz </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the KPD move in, B&uuml;lowplatz becomes a regular flashpoint. On 9 August 1931, communists murder two policemen outside the Babylon cinema. For their part, the Nazis enjoy provoking the Communists right outside their party headquarters. So the funeral procession for the murdered SA leader Horst Wessel is sent across B&uuml;lowplatz. When the National Socialists take power, they rename the building Horst-Wessel-Haus. From March 1933 onwards it houses the Sturmabteilung (SA).</p>\r\n",

They are members of the Sturmabteilung (SA), the Nazi&rsquo;s paramilitary wing, which has been terrorising Berlin for years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Panic at Caf&eacute; Reimann </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The brownshirts pile into the cafe, smashing furniture, shattering windows, beating up the customers. Panic breaks out when an SA man takes out his revolver and fires two bullets into the ceiling. Groups of brownshirts roam the Kurf&uuml;rstendamm, on the look-out for anyone who looks vaguely Jewish, even laying into a German nationalist, the journalist Peter Derichsweiler.&nbsp; Shopkeepers rush to lower their shutters, but the people on the street have no such protection against the attackers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Attack on Jewish New Year&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is no spontaneous attack by the SA. By 7.30pm, around a thousand brownshirts have gathered at the Memorial Church. They head<em> en masse</em> to the synagogue on Fasanenstra&szlig;e and hang around outside, waiting for the worshippers to emerge. Their choice of day is also not random &ndash; it&rsquo;s Rosh Hashana, Jewish New Year. But the SA men are too late, and the synagogue has already emptied. So they switch their attention to the Kurf&uuml;rstendamm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their attacks are highly organised. Two of the SA&rsquo;s leaders, Karl Ernst and Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorff, drive around in open-top cabs giving out orders. Behind the scenes, Goebbels has a clear strategy. The Ku&#39;damm is too &ldquo;Jewish&rdquo; for his liking, so over the years he has been sending his men here to hand out leaflets and threaten Jews.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The police are too late, the courts are too weak </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The police are nowhere to be seen. For nearly an hour, the SA are left to wreak havoc. And when the police finally turn up, their attempts to stop the violence are lukewarm at best. By eleven o&rsquo;clock, the violence is continuing unabated on nearby Nollendorfplatz. 50 men are arrested, but only 22 remain in custody.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The defendants are given short prison sentences, and these sentences are reduced still further on appeal in February 1932. Graf von Helldorff and Karl Ernst are actually acquitted, and Helldorff goes on to pursue his own career in the police force. In 1933, the Nazis appoint him police chief of Potsdam and Berlin.</p>\r\n",

In the early 1920s, hundreds of thousands of people gather here to demonstrate against militarism and tyranny. This is the precise spot where emperors would accept their oaths of allegiance from young recruits. During World War I, this is where captured enemy cannons were displayed and where German weapons were blessed. On 1 August 1921, 200,000 people are mobilised to take part in an anti-war demonstration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Democrats and pacifists protest peacefully, but opponents of the Weimar Republic resort to violence. Just three weeks after this peace demonstration, centrist politician Matthias Erzberger is killed by right-wing terrorists. His memorial service in the Lustgarten on 31 August 1921 is attended by 500,000 Berliners, turning it into a rejection of violence and a demonstration of support for the Republic.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Berlin remains red!&rdquo; <sup>4 </sup></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The right to protest is enshrined in the Weimar constitution. The workers&rsquo; parties make the most of this, with Social Democrats and Communists regularly mobilising their supporters to attend May day rallies in the Lustgarten. They swear allegiance to socialism as they wave their red flags and sing the Internationale. But demonstrations are increasingly banned after 1928 because of street battles instigated by the communists.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, it&rsquo;s the National Socialists who benefit from these proletarian battles for control of Berlin&rsquo;s streets. In March and April 1932, the brownshirts hold their own rallies in the Lustgarten for the very first time. These right-wing rallies are initially much smaller than those organised by the anti-fascist Iron Front. But emergency decrees and bans on demonstrations mean that the supporters of the Republic are increasingly on the back foot.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, even after the Nazis take power, the pro-democracy Reichsbanner organisation continues to display the resistance of &ldquo;red Berlin&rdquo;. On 19 February 1933, the Republicans gather in the Lustgarten for the last time. Reichsbanner leader Karl H&ouml;ltermann stands on a rostrum swathed in the organisation&rsquo;s traditional black, red and gold.

As the leader of the Young Turks movement, Talaat Pasha was one of the main perpetrators of the Armenian Genocide during the First World War. Under his instructions, soldiers began systematically exterminating the Christian minority, leading to the deportation and murder of 1.5 million Armenians. After the war the Young Turks were forced to step down and those responsible for the Genocide were sentenced to death in absentia. Talaat Pasha fled to Germany, a former ally, and lived incognito in Berlin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The murderer is a victim </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>His landlady describes the accused as a serious, melancholy man who likes to play sad songs on the mandolin and always seems terribly nervous. Tehlirian, born in 1897 in Pakaritch, Turkey, paints himself as a victim. He talks of massacres in his hometown and the murder of his parents in June 1915. He describes how his sister was kidnapped and raped, and how he had to watch as his younger brother was killed with an axe. How he lay under the body for two days and then fled to safety in the mountains. He explains how, after several years of living a nomadic life, he came to Berlin in late 1920 to escape these terrible memories. But the images in his head continue to haunt him and his dead mother appears to him at night, demanding revenge. He claims he bumped into Talaat Pasha by chance and moved into the apartment across the street, where thoughts of revenge drove him to take action.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A tragic avenging angel </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The defence succeeds in justifying Tehlirian&rsquo;s actions on moral grounds. Expert witnesses give credence to his account and support his claim of diminished responsibility. They claim his epilepsy can be traced back to the mental disturbances caused by his traumatic experiences. The authorities are also pressuring the court to close the case as quietly as possible. What appears to be an isolated act must not be politicised. The fanatical murderer becomes a tragic avenger, and it takes the jury just one hour to declare his innocence.

They brought the tradition of Russian cabaret to Berlin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The glorious colours of the Blue Bird </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The theatre is housed in a converted backyard cinema. It has two tiers of seats but is small and intimate. As soon as you step inside, you&rsquo;re assailed by its brightly coloured interior &ndash; blue velvet on the walls, a green ceiling, pink stucco ornamentation and yellow lampshades. The stage curtain is adorned with an abstract image of a blue bird hovering over a stylised flower meadow.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yakov Yuzhny acts as compere, introducing the cabaret acts in his broken German. Kurt Tucholsky describes him as follows: &ldquo;He looks like a very clever, long-legged bird. He has dangerously clever, dark eyes and a penetrating voice. He makes a delightful noise that sounds a little like German. He is always in control, and has such wit, tact, delicacy and taste!&rdquo; <sup>2 </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not only Tucholsky and Goldstein who are spellbound by the Blue Bird. Berlin&rsquo;s audiences are thrilled by the new, surprising mix of vibrant stage sets, acting, music, song and dance. There&rsquo;s no politics and no dirty jokes. Instead, they are treated to a fascinating blend of Russian folklore, modern art and European theatre traditions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The programme is extremely eclectic. A scene with Russian workers&#39; songs might be followed by traditional folklore, a Spanish dance, a parody of Americanism or a tragic fairy tale set in a French royal palace. It&rsquo;s a mixture of the grotesque, satirical, nostalgic, melodramatic and joyful. The audience seems to find it enchanting, wonderful, entertaining, tasteful and beautiful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Blue Bird takes flight </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like many of the refugees, this Russian/German theatre is only a temporary visitor to Berlin. After around two years it sets off on a tour of Europe and North America, but always comes back to Berlin. For Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; and theatre director Yakov Yuzhny, the Blue Bird is a blessing. He describes himself as a phoenix who &ldquo;died in Moscow in 1920&rdquo; and was &ldquo;reborn in Berlin in 1921&rdquo;. <sup>3</sup></p>\r\n",

They are there to see that evening&rsquo;s Hollywood production: <em>Jungle Woman</em>. But everyone is buzzing about something more exciting than the film: Did you hear? &ndash; What? - Fritz Auge was shot yesterday! - The Communist? &ndash; Yeah, him. Here on B&uuml;lowplatz. &ndash; Who shot him? &ndash; Schweinebacke&rsquo;s security police of course! - Unbelievable! What the... &ndash; Shhhh! He&rsquo;s coming.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>All the locals know the three policemen who are striding towards the cinema. Paul Anlauf, known as &ldquo;Schweinebacke&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;pig&rsquo;s cheek&rdquo; &ndash; is head of the 7th police district. Alongside him are captain Franz Lenck and sergeant Richard Willig, nicknamed &ldquo;the Hussar&rdquo;. Over the last few years they have been trying to keep the peace in this area around the Communist Party headquarters on B&uuml;lowplatz, but it&rsquo;s a constant flashpoint. 19-year-old worker Fritz Auge was shot dead during a scuffle with police on 8 August 1931, but he was not the first victim of the troubles. Two members of the security police were also shot dead here earlier in the year, and a third was seriously injured. The graffiti on the walls screams: &ldquo;Two policemen will be killed for every worker shot! The Red Front claims revenge!&rdquo; <sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Shots fired on B&uuml;lowplatz </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the three officers approach the Babylon, a voice behind them calls out: &ldquo;You take the Hussar, you take Schweinebacke, and you the other one.&rdquo; <sup>2 </sup>Shots ring out. Anlauf falls to the ground dead. Lenck is hit in the back but manages to pursue his attackers into the cinema foyer before collapsing. Willig is also seriously wounded, but he pulls out his revolver and starts shooting wildly. One of his bullets hits and kills 16-year-old worker Gerhard Bolle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Local police rush to the cinema and start searching the crowd, but the killers have escaped through the rear courtyard. Police raid the Karl Liebknecht House and confiscate the latest edition of the <em>Red Flag.</em> In the hours that follow, the furious police beat up anyone that moves, shoot at people as they run away, and even fire at the surrounding buildings, claiming they are being shot at by local residents. In the end, the police estimate that, in addition to their murdered colleagues, two &ldquo;agitators&rdquo; have been killed and 30 wounded, including women and children.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the following weeks, the Communist Party of Germany&rsquo;s headquarters remains closed and the<em> Red Flag </em>is banned. B&uuml;lowplatz is closed off to prevent further clashes. Police arrest dozens of Communists during their hunt for the attackers, but they can&rsquo;t find any clear evidence of direct involvement in the crime. The two shooters are well on their way to Moscow. One of them, the 23-year-old Red Front fighter Erich Mielke, is destined to gain further notoriety in East Germany.</p>\r\n",

In early June 1930, the Rudolph Karstadt company allows circus rider Cilly Feindt to ride her horse up the escalators to demonstrate how easy it is for shoppers to access the giant new department store on Hermannplatz. It seems that Germany&#39;s largest department store chain is also looking to America for inspiration for its advertising.</p>\r\n",

Let&rsquo;s go back to 21 June 1929. A huge crowd has gathered to witness the opening of the nation&rsquo;s largest temple to consumerism. The gigantic building has broken all records. The stone colossus contains more retail space on its seven floors than KaDeWe. It also has three atriums, its own bathing pool and several restaurants. A direct subway connection, 24 escalators and 24 lifts channel the masses into the store and around its sales floors. 4,000 staff are there to meet their customers&#39; every need.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Berlin newspapers are impressed by the new &ldquo;American-style mammoth department store&rdquo; <sup>1</sup> and celebrate Berlin&#39;s &ldquo;latest skyscraper&rdquo; <sup>2</sup> as &ldquo;a new landmark for the growing, aspiring metropolis&rdquo;. <sup>3</sup> The spectacularly-lit building is a sight to behold at night too. The columns of lights on the 56-metre-high corner towers even help to guide pilots as they approach Tempelhof Airport.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This magnificent shoppers&rsquo; paradise on the edge of the working-class districts of Kreuzberg and Neuk&ouml;lln quickly becomes a go-to place for Berlin&rsquo;s urbanites. Karstadt brings in the customers with a string of new attractions &ndash; buy a build-your-own glider kit, attend readings by famous writers such as Erich K&auml;stner and Heinrich Mann, or record your own voice onto disc using a Phonotone device. In the afternoons, the huge roof garden is the perfect place to enjoy coffee and cake with panoramic views over the city or dance to the sounds of live bands. Karstadt&rsquo;s own song, specially composed for the store opening, is a big hit &ndash; and of course you can buy it as a 78 record.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Consumer palace in crisis </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the dream of boundless consumerism is soon shattered when the global economy collapses after Wall Street&rsquo;s Black Friday. The rapid decline in Karstadt&rsquo;s bulk purchasing power pushes its balance sheet into the red. The group responds with mass layoffs and cost-cutting measures. By 1932, only 1,000 staff are still employed at the Hermannplatz store and two entire sales floors stand empty. Driven by hunger, people are stealing food from the &ldquo;land of milk and honey&rdquo; <sup>4</sup> that is the food department. Desperate people are leaping to their deaths from the roof garden.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March 1933, under pressure from the Nazis, Karstadt dismisses most of its Jewish staff. The building is destroyed in the last days of the Second World War, and Karstadt starts rebuilding its former flagship store in 1950. But today&rsquo;s building is barely half the size of the original and provides few reminders of the glitz and glamour of the Roaring Twenties.</p>\r\n",

At the time, it was the largest, most modern power plant in Europe.&nbsp; Built on the banks of the river Spree in the district of Rummelsburg, it was designed to satisfy Berlin&#39;s insatiable thirst for electricity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p><strong>Electropolis Berlin </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Berlin is dominated by the electrical industry. The global corporations Siemens and AEG both have their headquarters in the capital, along with huge production facilities. It is also home to other smaller producers of cables, light bulbs and electrical appliances. The city has an unquenchable thirst for electricity. One of the biggest consumers is the Reichsbahn, which is working on the electrification of the local rail network. By 1928 more than half of all private households are already connected to the grid. And then there are the street lamps, department stores, and neon signs &ndash; the city shows off its size and prosperity by lighting itself up at night.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The growing demand for electricity is matched by pressure to increase the city&rsquo;s power supply. The creation of Greater Berlin in 1920 makes it possible to standardise and centralise the city&rsquo;s power supply. In 1923, BEWAG, the municipal electricity company, takes over responsibility for planning and operating new power plants. The city&rsquo;s small, unprofitable power plants are shut down and an ambitious new building programme is drawn up. At the heart of the plans is the Klingenberg power plant.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A cathedral of electricity </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A huge building is constructed along both sides of K&ouml;penicker Chaussee. Its fa&ccedil;ade consists of rows of dark red pillars reaching skywards &ndash; like an industrial cathedral. Eight chimneys and a 42-metre-high administrative block make the power plant a prominent landmark. A special canal is dug so that coal can be shipped in directly. The plant employs a brand-new technique &ndash; the coal is ground to a fine dust before being fed into the furnaces. Three huge steam turbines generate the electricity. People are particularly impressed by the fact that the plant automatically adjusts power production in line with fluctuations in demand. The control centre is totally white &ndash; far removed from the image of coal-burning furnaces in soot-covered vaults.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>First the work... then the fun! </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>BEWAG is proud to show off its new power plant as evidence of how the city&rsquo;s infrastructure is being modernised. Every day, groups of visitors are given tours of the new beating heart of this industrious city. The company wants Berliners to know where their electricity comes from.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Klingenberg provides the city&rsquo;s residents with more than just power. At first BEWAG doesn&rsquo;t know what to do with the waste heat produced by the power station because there are no nearby residential areas that could use it for heating. So the water from the plant is fed into a specially designed outdoor swimming pool &ndash; a nice warm alternative to swimming in the Wannsee lido.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Schwarz is to give a talk on the problem of securing peace in Europe. The car arrives with three men in it, all claiming to be radio technicians. After a while, Schwarz realises they are not heading for Voxhaus in Potsdamer Stra&szlig;e. When he tries to raise the alarm, they threaten him with guns.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>Meanwhile, Karl Schulz, a Communist member of the Prussian parliament, arrives in the Voxhaus broadcasting studio. He says he is Wolfgang Schwarz. When he goes on air, he begins by reading a few lines from the talk as announced. Suddenly, he changes the cadence of his voice &ndash; and the content of the speech. He forcefully argues for supporting the Communist party referendum to prevent German naval rearmament.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Germany&rsquo;s first radio broadcasts from Voxhaus</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 29 October 1923, the Berlin Funkstunde goes on air &ndash; the first German radio programme. It broadcasts from simple sound studios in the attic of the Voxhaus building, once on the Alte Potsdamer Stra&szlig;e close to today&rsquo;s entrance to the Panoramapunkt viewing platform in the Kollhoff Tower. The Funkstunde broadcaster sets out to entertain and educate in equal measure. In the 1920s, fierce debates rage over how much of the daily programme should be devoted to political developments. Initially, the government tries to restrict political discussion on news broadcasters, and so Wolfgang Schwarz&rsquo;s talk is censored in advance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Banditry, fraud or a legitimate political weapon?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many newspapers treat the kidnapping and fake lecture as a cheap trick &ndash; but the background is a serious political conflict over Germany&rsquo;s rearmament. The opposition SPD social democrat party first rejects the funding for new armoured cruisers for the navy. After elections in spring 1928, things change. The SPD are clear winners and can nominate their candidate as chancellor &ndash; but rely on coalition support from the conservatives. So, the SPD changes tack in cabinet and supports building the armoured cruisers. The change of heart leads to bitter exchanges in the SPD, and further fuels the heated dispute between the SPD and the Communist party. The Communists call for a referendum against constructing the cruisers &ndash; and their audacious broadcasting adventure is a vain attempt to mobilise the masses for their cause.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the broadcast finishes, the car leaves Wolfgang Schwarz on a country road outside Berlin. Over the following weeks, all three kidnappers are apprehended and charged with coercion and unlawful detention. They show no remorse for their actions. They assure the court that Wolfgang Schwarz was never in serious danger. Two of the guns were toys, the other was genuine but not loaded.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The entire affair is also embarrassing for the Funkstunde studios. No one there ever notices the talk is different from the manuscript. Afterwards, the broadcaster even insists on paying the agreed fee &ndash; but the fake speaker refuses to accept it.</p>\r\n",

The violence escalated because of a ban on demonstrations issued by Berlin&rsquo;s social democrat police chief Karl Z&ouml;rgiebel. He is prepared to use all his powers to uphold the ban, and only allows rallies to be held indoors. But the communists ignore the ban and organise rallies on the streets of Berlin to mark the proletariat&rsquo;s day of struggle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>First water hoses, then machine guns</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the early hours, demonstrators gather all over Berlin. One procession heads off to Alexanderplatz and gathers in front of Tietz department store. They are awaited by a large police contingent who attack them with water cannons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The day takes a more dramatic turn in other parts of Berlin. The police frequently and needlessly resort to the use of firearms, and around noon a demonstrator is shot at Hackescher Markt. Social democrat Max Gemeinhardt is shot dead at K&ouml;sliner Stra&szlig;e 19 in Wedding when he leans out of his third-floor window to talk to police. This is just the tragic beginning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Curfew and state of emergency in Berlin&#39;s slums </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The protests drag on for days, especially in the area around Hermannstra&szlig;e. The demonstrators erect barricades using advertising columns here and on Prinz-Handjery-Stra&szlig;e, today&rsquo;s Briesestra&szlig;e. They smash street lights, cut overhead cables and hijack trams. The chief of police and his commander Magnus Heimannsberg struggle to get a grip on the situation. Z&ouml;rgiebel issues a curfew and announces a state of emergency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The police advance with armoured cars, flares and spotlights, firing on balconies and windows. 50-year-old widow Marie R&ouml;bner and her friend Mrs K&ouml;ppen are killed by police bullets on their balcony at Hermannstra&szlig;e 177.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It takes until the weekend to subdue Berlin&rsquo;s working-class neighbourhoods. By the end of the uprising 33 people have been killed and almost 200 injured. The victims &ndash; like journalist Charles Mackay &ndash; were mainly innocent bystanders. No policemen sustained gunshot injuries, but they fired close to 11,000 bullets. Their reckless behaviour goes unpunished.</p>\r\n",

"mainText": "<p>Some hail taxis, while others take a turn on Berlin&#39;s most prestigious boulevard, the Kurf&uuml;rstendamm, before heading home. Money talks, and the bars, caf&eacute;s and cabarets all vie for the attention of the passers-by, whether it&rsquo;s Berlin&rsquo;s bohemian set, visitors from abroad, or German tourists.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Champagne, champagne &ndash; the crazy years <sup>1</sup></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the corner of Joachimsthaler Stra&szlig;e and Augsburger Stra&szlig;e, the Kakadu bar is managed by brothers Georg and Dagobert Tichauer. It&rsquo;s a hip place to be, with a daily programme that includes acrobatic dancers, comedy, cabaret, live bands, a vegetarian restaurant on the mezzanine floor and Berlin&#39;s longest bar, which stretches 15 metres along the back wall. The bar promises its guests a touch of exoticism. The South Seas-style furniture evokes memories of long-lost colonies. The walls are covered with golden red fabric and the rooms are flooded with rich red light. Meanwhile, the bar provides a striking contrast in shades of blue and gold.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hostesses glide around, ensuring their guests are having a good time. They are dressed like &ldquo;flappers&rdquo;, confident young women in loose, sleeveless dresses, who smoke and drink and behave like brash young men. Outside, the economy is in tatters. Inside there is dancing and drinking, flirting and partying. All accompanied by a wild kind of music that is rapidly gaining popularity in the Twenties, but also attracting criticism &ndash; jazz.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The rhythm of the city </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the Kakadu has a regular house band led by Max Herrnsdorf, it also occasionally puts on a &ldquo;Tschetzbend&rdquo;, or jazz band. Then the dance floor is jumping as guests dance the Charleston and Shimmy. Everybody can have a go because there don&#39;t seem to be any fixed dance steps. The guardians of public morals view all this wiggling and shaking with suspicion; they seem to be breaking sexual taboos. But, as Franz Wolfgang Koebner notes as early as 1921, the waltz is &ldquo;as good as dead&rdquo;. <sup>2 </sup>In contrast, the jazz bands are alive and kicking &ndash; playing music that is fast, eccentric, and loud. The new, modern city dweller rushes everywhere &ndash; and jazz rushes with them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bands are brash and noisy, but the Kakadu also puts on more refined jazz ensembles for those with more sophisticated musical tastes. There&rsquo;s a constant coming-and-going at the Kakadu, which is disturbing for local residents. But it&rsquo;s all over at three in the morning. The band plays its last number as the audience call for more. The next day, it all starts again. Until 1936, when it really is all over &ndash; forever.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>Saturday, 9 November 1918. A wave of revolutions across Germany reaches Berlin. In the afternoon, the Lustgarten square fills with packed crowds. The guards at the gateways to the City Palace leave their posts. The police and officers move off. The revolutionaries take over the City Palace, the Prussian centre of power and century-long residence of the Hohenzollern rulers.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>On the first floor over the impressive entrance known as Portal IV, a window opens. A red blanket is placed over the balustrade. This is the same window where, on 1 August 1914, Kaiser Wilhelm II announced the start of the war to his cheering subjects. But four years and 16 million dead later, the Kaiser has abdicated. Now, the figure at the window is the workers&rsquo; leader, Karl Liebknecht, son of the founder of Germany&rsquo;s SPD socialist party and godson of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. For Karl Liebknecht, this is the climax of his political career, a moment making the deprivations, imprisonment, and persecution he suffered all worthwhile.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shouts out his message to the eager crowds below. The war is over, the day of freedom has come, never again will the Hohenzollern dynasty, the Prussian rulers, walk over this square. From the window, he proclaims the free socialist republic of Germany. <sup>1 </sup>The people cheer and wave flags, raising their hands to take an oath in support of the new republic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A bloody civil war</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Liebknecht&rsquo;s triumph is short-lived. The revolution ushers in a civil war, with months of bloody uprisings and street battles. On 15 January 1919, a paramilitary unit of World War I veterans arrest Karl Liebknecht, and summarily execute him together with Rosa Luxemburg. By then, the City Palace&rsquo;s Portal IV &ndash; where crowds gathered to celebrate the start and end of the First World War &ndash; is already badly damaged, shelled during a skirmish on 24 December 1918 between regular army units and the socialist revolutionary <em>Volksmarinedivision</em> entrenched in the palace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Berlin City Palace demolished</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Portal IV fades into obscurity until 1950, after the end of World War II. The regime in East Germany wants to tear down the shell of the burned-out City Palace, eradicating all traces of this relic of Prussian power. At the last minute, measures are taken to secure the balcony from which Karl Liebknecht reputedly declared Germany a socialist republic. The remains of the portal are put into storage. Finally, ten years later, construction brigades integrate the &ldquo;Liebknecht Portal&rdquo;, as it is now known, into the fa&ccedil;ade of East Germany&rsquo;s State Council building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Humboldt Forum</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, you can find two Portal IVs. The remains of the original are set prominently in the front fa&ccedil;ade of the former GDR&rsquo;s State Council official building, now home to a private college. Facing Lustgarten square, a replica of the portal has been set up on the original site as part of the reconstructed fa&ccedil;ade of the Berlin City Palace &ndash; the new Humboldt Forum.</p>\r\n",

"mainText": "<p>On 14 February 1926, 20,000 spectators flock to the Gesundbrunnen district to watch the big match in the &ldquo;Plumpe&rdquo;, the affectionate nickname that Hertha fans have given to their home ground. Hertha takes the lead thanks to a penalty scored by centre forward Hans Grenzel. But the Violets equalise just three minutes later, when Hans Schr&ouml;der&#39;s cross is headed in by Otto Wiese. Hertha&rsquo;s goalkeeper, &ldquo;Fredy&rdquo; G&ouml;tze, has no chance. At half-time, it&rsquo;s still one-all.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cool, charismatic, successful </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>All over Germany, football is growing in popularity, providing an outlet for emotion and aggression. A fan culture emerges that rewards the passion and fighting spirit of the team with fierce loyalty and support. Every weekend the fans make their pilgrimage to the football stadium to cheer on their idols &ndash; who work alongside them in the factories from Monday to Friday. Hertha is riding the crest of the football wave. The Blue and Whites merge with the wealthy Berlin SC club in 1923 to create Hertha BSC. This provides the funds to buy the sports ground in Gesundbrunnen and turn it into the city&rsquo;s most modern football stadium. Led by playmaker Johannes &ldquo;Hanne&rdquo; Sobek, who joins the club before the start of the 1925/26 season, and striker Hans Ruch, the team soon pulls in the crowds. Cool, charismatic, successful, the working-class club &ndash; known as the &ldquo;old lady&rdquo; &ndash; has never had a more authentic image.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The old lady can be fickle </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second half kicks off at the Plumpe. Six minutes after the restart, Wiese scores again to give the Violets a 2:1 lead. The game has completely turned around. Fast, flat passes, attacks down the wings, unexpected offside traps &ndash; everything that the Hertha players normally do so well is simply not working for them today. Reporting on the match, the local press says the Borussia team gained the upper hand because they were &ldquo;much fitter&rdquo;. <sup>1 </sup>When &ldquo;Bubi&rdquo; V&ouml;lker misses a free kick for Hertha in the 83rd minute and Wilhelm Hoffmann scores a penalty for TeBe, it&rsquo;s all over. The final score is 4:1 to TeBe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>German Championship final </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, that loss against TeBe turns out to be Hertha&rsquo;s only defeat of the 1925/26 season. They are the undisputed kings of Berlin football. They also reach the final of the German Championship, beating K&ouml;nigsberg, Frankfurt along the way. The semi-final is played at the Deutsches Stadion, where Hertha quickly dispatch the Hamburger SV team with a score of 4:2. But in the final they suffer a resounding defeat at the hands of an excellent F&uuml;rth team. But it won&rsquo;t be the last time that Sobek&rsquo;s team make it to the final.</p>\r\n",

"mainText": "<p>In the Twenties, the multi-purpose arena in Sch&ouml;neberg is a mecca for sports fans. Tens of thousands of spectators gather to cheer on cyclists as they whiz around the track during a six-day event or Norwegian figure skater Sonja Henie as she spins across the ice. Boxing is especially popular. It&rsquo;s the evening of the 4 April 1928. People in the stands have paid 5 marks to get in, while the wealthy punters at ringside have forked out 75 marks. It&rsquo;s not cheap entertainment, but the arena is sold out. This kind of hand-to-hand combat attracts people from every social class. Bravery, aggression, speed &ndash; such attributes have turned boxing into a mass spectator sport and the boxers themselves into superstars.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The German Oak </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main attraction is the third fight of the evening, the German Heavyweight Championship. The favourite among bookmakers and journalists is defending champion Franz Diener, known as the German Oak. The Th&uuml;ringian heavyweight is 1.83 metres tall and weighs in at a solid 175 pounds, mostly muscle. He is only 26 but this butcher by trade is an experienced boxer who has learnt his trade in America.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His challenger, Max Schmeling, weighs in 10 lbs lighter. The 22-year-old has become a firm favourite among Berlin&rsquo;s boxing fans since becoming light heavyweight champion of Europe by beating the Italian Michele Bonaglia with a first-round knockout in the same arena just three months earlier. But this title fight against Diener is his first bout in the sport&rsquo;s top weight category.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Berlin&rsquo;s sporting crucible&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The referee&#39;s talk is brief, and the crowd goes quiet as the anticipation builds. Diener looks tense when the fight gets underway, but he&rsquo;s on the front foot. Schmeling suffers an injury to his thumb early on; he later discovers he has chipped the bone. Round three really gets the crowd going. Diener surges forward, forcing Schmeling onto the ropes. The challenger is briefly confused, unable to defend himself from the punches that are raining down on him. But the defending champion seems reluctant to go for the killer punch. Schmeling raises his guard and goes on the counterattack. The pain in his hand is forgotten. He breaks through Diener&rsquo;s guard, landing a hard right to his opponent&#39;s eye. Blood pours down Diener&rsquo;s face, clouding his vision. The German Oak is toppling but refuses to be felled.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The boxers batter each other remorselessly for 15 rounds; punches hammer into faces and ribs. The final bell rings and the fight for fame, honour and 30,000 marks is over. Both men are so exhausted they can barely stand. The audience screams, claps, cheers. The Sportpalast has once again lived up to its reputation as the capital&rsquo;s sporting crucible. The judges declare Schmeling the winner on points. Controversy swirls around his wafer-thin success, but Schmeling doesn&rsquo;t care. He is the undisputed champion of Germany and a stellar boxing career lies ahead.</p>\r\n",

"<p>But victory is quickly followed by disillusionment. Schmeling only remains German champion for four weeks. The injury to his thumb proves slow to heal and he can&rsquo;t defend his title, so the boxing association forces him to relinquish all his titles. But the young boxer has much loftier ambitions. In May 1928 he boards a ship bound for America. Big purses and world championship titles are beckoning.</p>\n"

"introtext": "<p>75 million eggs? If the thought of eating even one egg for Sunday breakfast is too much for you, you might find it hard to believe that 75 million eggs were once stored in this huge building with the yellow clinker facade. In their typically blunt fashion, Berliners call this cold storage warehouse the &ldquo;Eierspeicher&rdquo;, or &ldquo;egg store&rdquo;. It opened in 1929 in the Osthafen dock area as a logistics hub for the city&rsquo;s egg trade.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>Along with handling 450 truckloads of eggs, the warehouse also has plenty of space for other chilled goods, such as 8,000 tonnes of frozen meat, game and poultry. The facility has nine storeys and thousands of cubic metres of storage space, which is kept at -10 to +8 degrees Celsius. It also stores butter, wine, canned goods and deli products.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Feeding Berlin&rsquo;s millions </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The steel-frame building commissioned by Leipziger K&uuml;hltransit AG is a classic example of a modern, purpose-built facility designed for a distribution company in the Twenties: efficient, functional, dull. Around 10 million eggs are consumed in Berlin every day, that&rsquo;s two eggs per person per day. The egg storage warehouse is designed to close a gap in the supply chain. It&rsquo;s a constant source of annoyance to chefs and housewifes alike that eggs go off so quickly, but now they can arrive in the shops in perfect condition. Berlin is growing, and so are the challenges of moving goods around the city. Berliners want fresh food.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Goods from all over the world </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The cold storage warehouse is mainly a transit hub. Perishable foods from as far afield as Argentina, Austrialia and China arrive here to be repackaged and prepared for onward transit. It has the perfect location, providing easy access by sea, rail and road. Ramps and freight elevators ensure a fast turnaround of goods.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Form follows function </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The functional, plain block designed by architect Oskar Pusch is inevitably a little short on aesthetic appeal. The building envelope is well insulated, with smooth brickwork on the outside and a 20-cm layer of cork cladding on the inside. There are no windows (except in the stairwell), no wall openings, no sunlight &ndash; because if any heat gets in, the energy consumption of the refrigerators and other machinery goes through the roof. The architect tries to brighten up the exterior by adding a coloured clinker facade, but the beauty of this imitation Gothic ornamentation is very much in the eye of the beholder. Don&#39;t be fooled by the glass frontage that you can see on both sides of the building. The glass was added during renovations in 2001 to try to break up the monotony of this brick monolith. The Universal Music Group moved into the building in 2002. At least they don&rsquo;t have to worry about sound insulation!</p>\r\n",

Instead, the soldiers hurl abuse at the Spartacist. &ldquo;See, gunpowder&rsquo;s too good for you, we&#39;ll rip you open and cut you up so that everyone has a piece of you!&rdquo; <sup>1 </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Battle for the <em>Vorw&auml;rts </em>building </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 5 January 1918, mass protests break out when police chief Emil Eichhorn, a supporter of the radical Spartacist League, is fired. The demonstrators spontaneously decide to occupy Berlin&rsquo;s newspaper district. Hilde Steinbrink, a mother of two from Neuk&ouml;lln, joins other revolutionary workers to storm the headquarters of <em>Vorw&auml;rts</em>, the newspaper of the SPD party. The Social Democratic government under Friedrich Ebert is worried that there could be a Russian-style coup. So this amateurish uprising provides an opportunity to crush the &ldquo;Bolshevik menace&rdquo;, as the movement has been dubbed by the press over recent weeks. <sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>SPD member and later Minister of Defence Gustav Noske sends troops marching into the centre. The poorly-armed revolutionaries are no match for the battle-hardened former soldiers that make up the Freikorps. On the morning of 11 January, they turn their machine guns and mortars on the <em>Vorw&auml;rts </em>building.&nbsp; The revolutionaries realise their situation is hopeless, so they send out a delegation with a white flag to negotiate terms. But the bombardment continues until the occupiers offer their unconditional surrender.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Beat Red Rosa to death!&rdquo; <sup>3</sup></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between 200 and 300 revolutionaries, including 20 women, step out onto the street with their hands up. The government&rsquo;s troops greet them with blows, kicks and insults. Hilde Steinbrink is a particular target of their hatred because they think she fired the machine gun that claimed the most Freikorps victims. They also believe she is actually Rosa Luxemburg.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jeered at by the soldiers and beaten with sticks by passers-by, the prisoners are herded to the nearby Dragoon barracks. There they are set about with rifle butts and riding whips. Finally, they are lined up against a wall and forced to look at the grotesquely arranged corpses of their comrades who attempted to negotiate with the government.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The soldiers mockingly tell them to expect the same fate. For an hour, they stare down the barrel of the machine gun, fearing for their lives. The cruel game is only brought to an end when Friedrich Stampfer, editor-in-chief of <em>Vorw&auml;rts</em>, intervenes. Four days later, the leaders of the Spartacist movement, Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, are captured. This time, no-one is there to save them.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>Welcome to the opening of the third &ldquo;Great German Radio Exhibition&rdquo;! On 3 September 1926, the late summer sun is shining brightly on the fairs and exhibition grounds along Berlin&rsquo;s Kaiserdamm boulevard. The guests gathered for the opening admire the festive decorations in the exhibition hall. The Berlin Radio Orchestra launches into Beethoven&rsquo;s Leonore Overture No. 3. As the final notes fade away, radio announcer Alfred Braun reads an inauguration poem. Then Gustav B&ouml;&szlig;, Mayor of Berlin, officially declares the new Radio Tower open to the public.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p><strong>A mini-Eiffel Tower</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Radio Tower rises into sky behind the ceremony, a silent guest of honour, its iron braces decorated with garlands of flowers. Although inspired by the Eiffel Tower in Paris, Berlin&rsquo;s Radio Tower looks more linear and less elaborate &ndash; and, as a result, is lighter and much cheaper to construct. The German capital&rsquo;s new iconic landmark is around 150 metres high, just half the height of the Eiffel Tower, and stands as a symbol of global communication and technical progress. In his Welcome Address, Dr. Alfred Schick, director of fairs and exhibitions, enthuses: &ldquo;As a new Victory Column in the west of the city, the Radio Tower proclaims the human mind&rsquo;s peaceful victory over time and space.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>From A for anode to W for wave meter</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the foot of the Radio Tower, visitors stream towards the large exhibition hall known as the <em>Haus der Funkindustrie (House of the Wireless Industry)</em>. So, let&rsquo;s take a look at the attractions for ourselves. For ten days, 250 exhibiters at the trade fair are showing the latest innovations in wireless transmission technologies. The Berlin companies of Siemens, AEG and Telefunken are the market leaders &ndash; and they assert their right to place their exhibition areas and displays in the centre of the hall. Around them, competitors from local heroes, like the Nora-Radio company from Charlottenburg, to national players, such as SABA from the Black Forest, show off radio frequency coils, condensers and headphones. Does that lush sound seem familiar? Then it must be an Acuston speaker! Don&rsquo;t miss a visit to the gallery &ndash; there, in one of the soundproofed demonstration booths, you can experience a radio broadcaster in action. The Funkstunde, Germany&rsquo;s first radio broadcaster, is broadcasting live from the fair and exhibition grounds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Radio is uncharted territory</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The years of radio&rsquo;s enthusiastic youth, between 1923 and 1933, are a time of innovation and experiments. Early radio construction and listening is, first and foremost, driven by amateurs, geeks and boffins. In the early days, technical know-how is needed to set cables and antenna for interference-free reception. But by 1928 at the latest, German companies are already looking to produce radios in series. The young republican democracy of Germany, founded in 1919, promises to put a radio in every home so all its citizens can participate in cultural life. After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, the regime instrumentalise the Great German Radio Exhibition as a political show. Aware of the power of wireless as a propaganda channel, the Nazi regime prioritises production of the affordable Volksempf&auml;nger (&ldquo;people&rsquo;s receiver&rdquo;). Then, at the latest, the world of radio loses its innocence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Radio Tower falls silent</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the Second World War, the idea of a major fair for radio is revitalised. From 1971, Berlin hosts the<em> IFA (Internationale Funkausstellung)</em>, attracting electronics experts and fans from all over the world. Just as in the 1920s, the event is held in the exhibition hall directly next to the Funkturm &ndash; Berlin&rsquo;s Radio Tower. There is, though, one major difference &ndash; with modern transmitters so powerful, the Radio Tower has long fallen silent. But the Radio Tower restaurant and viewing platform remain just as popular as ever.</p>\r\n",

The Violetta women&#39;s club is meeting in the Red Room for an &ldquo;evening of fun&rdquo;. Men have to stay outside &ndash; gawkers are not welcome. The band strikes up and everyone lets their hair down.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>The organiser and club leader is Lotte Hahm, a leading light of Berlin&rsquo;s lesbian scene. Looking dapper in her tuxedo, she gets everyone dancing the Tyrolienne. She wants everyone to dance with everyone else. Dance a few steps, then change partners &ndash; the women are always in the arms of someone new. Everyone is dancing, laughing, flirting &ndash; nobody&rsquo;s going home alone tonight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>An intimate, easy-going place</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nationalhof is actually a relic of the imperial age, when it was known as the K&ouml;nigshof (the Royal Court). In the 1920s, it becomes a popular meeting place for gays and lesbians. A homosexual theatre company puts on shows, it&rsquo;s home to a glamorous men&#39;s club and the largest of the gay rights pressure groups, the <em>Bund f&uuml;r Menschenrecht</em> (Federation for Human Rights), organises dances and gay rights events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For lesbians, the Nationalhof has its heyday between 1927 and 1929. The Violetta has about 400 members and the Nationalhof serves as their clubhouse in the heart of a neighbourhood packed with pubs and bars. The area around Nollendorfplatz is the &ldquo;lesbian love quarter&rdquo;, as Curt Moreck describes it in his famous <em>F&uuml;hrer durch das lasterhafte Berlin</em> (<em>Guide</em> <em>to Depraved Berlin).</em> <sup>1</sup> The Hohenzollerndiele, Dorian Gray, Topp-Keller, Ol&aacute; l&aacute; &ndash; there&rsquo;s a gay bar or club on every corner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Violetta club evenings are all about escaping everyday cares, being free to dance and find love in a laid-back, safe atmosphere. Moreck describes it as somewhere that women go to find &ldquo;diversion, entertainment, conviviality, love&rdquo;, adding: &ldquo;For many lesbian women, Violetta is the home they are deprived of elsewhere.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup> The Nationalhof allows them to be themselves, to find love and passion. It&rsquo;s a place where the predominantly young lesbians who frequent it can enjoy the kind of freedom that they are denied in the provinces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vibrant, diverse, creative</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Berlin is the lesbian capital of the world &ndash; and the world needs to know about it. Lesbian life is vibrant and exciting, female homosexuality is no longer taboo. Dozens of clubs large and small, like Violetta and its main competitor Monbijou, jostle to attract members by placing ads in magazines like <em>Die Freundin</em> and <em>Ledige Frauen.</em> Cool clubs like the Nationalhof hold sailor parties with tug-of-war competitions, &ldquo;Purple Nights&rdquo; with showers of sweets, costume balls and special evenings for transvestites, crossdressers and drag queens. Gay culture is flourishing with a diverse, creative nightlife.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, even before 1933, there are campaigns to criminalise lesbian lifestyles and denounce female homosexuality as immoral. Before long, magazine advertising is prohibited, and in 1932 the police chief bans the LGBT community from holding public dances. Raids and police checks ruin ladies&#39; evenings in bars and clubs. Then the Nazis take power and outlaw homosexuality, forcing lesbian Berlin to go underground.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>Imagine that it&rsquo;s Monday morning and you&rsquo;re on your way to work. You walk past Danatbank, a branch of Germany&#39;s second-largest bank here on Nollendorfplatz. People have gathered around a notice saying Danatbank is temporarily closed, but all savings deposits are safe as the government will guarantee these deposits and maintain business as usual.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>The notice is meant to be reassuring, but unfortunately it has quite the opposite effect. Now you&rsquo;re thinking you&rsquo;re glad your account is with the Sparkasse, not Danatbank. But you still rush round there to withdraw your money, just in case. You find yourself standing in a long queue at the Sparkasse. The run on the banks has begun. By 11.30 on the morning of 13 July 1931, the banks can no longer cope with the stampede of customers. Berliner Sparkasse alone has to pay out seven million Reichsmark. Bank holidays are declared to keep the banking system from total collapse. &ldquo;Holidays&rdquo; sounds harmless enough, but these prove to be dark days for the financial sector. Nobody can access their savings, and monetary transactions grind to a halt for weeks on end.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Despair and distrust </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The banking crisis is homemade. German banks have taken out short-term foreign loans and used the money to offer longer-term loans to German companies &ndash; but without adequate capital to cover these longer terms. German industry is struggling after the stock market crash of 1929. Foreign creditors are getting jittery about the success of extremists in the Reichstag elections of September 1930 &ndash; especially the Nazi Party, which gets 18.3 percent of the vote. Confidence starts to wane in the reliability of German companies and the stability of the German government. Hundreds of millions of Reichsmark are withdrawn and the Reichsbank is running out of cash. Germany is on the verge of insolvency.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bail-outs, nationalisations and a bad bank </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Danatbank is the worst hit. Its head is Jakob Goldschmidt, one of Germany&#39;s best-known bankers, but he has overcooked the bank&rsquo;s expansion with some risky lending. The collapse of the Bremer Nordwolle company, which had disguised its losses and falsified its balance sheets, has dragged Danatbank into the red. Attempts to set up a solidarity package are unsuccessful after resistance from the bank&rsquo;s competitors &ndash; other major banks are not keen to get their fingers burned.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Standstill agreements with foreign lenders and the suspension of reparation payments help to calm the situation, and the introduction of a regulatory system shows that politicians are looking for long-term solutions. But it&rsquo;s too late for Danatbank, which is taken over by the state-owned Dresdner Bank. Other big banks like Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank are restructured with state aid. And a crisis management instrument is introduced that has a familiar ring to it. An acceptance house and guarantee bank is set up to provide guarantees to the Reichsbank and allow troubled credit institutions to secure additional capital &ndash; the historical equivalent of a bad bank.</p>\r\n",

Like many others, the famous Berlin novelist makes a pilgrimage to Britz to sit on the terrace of cafe on the horseshoe crescent and gaze at the future of modern living. D&ouml;blin believes architect Bruno Taut&rsquo;s buildings are more than just the successful application of ideas on social housing. In the unostentatious grandeur of the architecture, he feels there is a force at work that will lead to the creation of a new, truly modern human being: &ldquo;It slowly has an educational effect, like a silent daily sermon.&rdquo;</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p><strong>A new town in the meadows </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Britz is a large residential development that was built from scratch after 1925. Trade union housing cooperatives and civil servants&rsquo; associations built 2,300 apartments on what had previously been fields and meadowland. The buildings designed by Bruno Taut and Martin Wagner for the trade union cooperatives came to represent a movement that was seeking to bring radical changes to urban life. &ldquo;Daylight, fresh air and sunshine&rdquo;, combined with good transport connections, would encourage families to leave Berlin&rsquo;s dark, squalid tenements and move to the suburbs. For many new tenants, this is the first time they have enjoyed the luxury of their own bathroom, complete with running water. Some people find the bright colours of the interiors provocative, even shocking, but this is typical of Bruno Taut&rsquo;s work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is mainly young families who move into the new apartments in September 1926. The spacious green areas make a perfect playground. Only the inside of the horseshoe is off limits. The original plan was to install a paddling pool with a sunbathing area and benches, but cost pressures led the local authorities to plant a hedge and instruct residents to keep off the grass. After all,<em> Ordnung muss sein &ndash; order must prevail!</em> But once a year the council allows them to hold a big summer party on the lawn. Then the estate turns into a model socialist community, with much waving of red flags and lusty renditions of the <em>Internationale </em>by workers&rsquo; choirs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A residential community with 10,000 members </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Members of the residents&rsquo; committee are elected annually to look after day-to-day matters. The estate&rsquo;s own weekly newsletter, the <em>Wohngemeinschaft (residential community)</em>, provides a forum for airing disputes. Are residents allowed to paint or wallpaper their brightly coloured walls? Can they hang out their laundry to dry in the front garden on public holidays? Is it OK to listen to the radio with the window open? Can they allow their cats to roam freely and let their kids play naked in the garden? The small community of artists that grows up around the anarchist Erich M&uuml;hsam and the communist Heinrich Vogeler regularly comes into conflict with their less free-spirited neighbours.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After 1929, the residents&rsquo; disputes about their garden fences become increasingly political. The Communist Party tries in vain to undermine the residents&#39; committee and publishes its own magazine called <em>Die andere Wohngemeinschaft &ndash; the other residential community</em>. The final summer party is held in July 1931, and now it&rsquo;s a purely social democratic event. Once the National Socialists gain power, the once so forward-looking community of the estate&rsquo;s early years is forced underground.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

"mainText": "<p>It&rsquo;s three days since Freikorp troops suppressed the Spartacist uprising in Berlin, when Communists occupied the police headquarters and the office of social democratic newspaper <em>Vorw&auml;rts</em>. The bloody protests ended with leaders of the uprising going on the run, including Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Arrests and interrogations </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around 9pm on 15 January, men of the Wilmersdorf militia force their way into Mannheimer Stra&szlig;e 43, the home of a merchant called Siegfried Marcusson. This is where the leaders of the Sparticist movement had taken refuge the previous day. Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg and Wilhelm Pieck are all led away. Luxemburg is allowed to take a small suitcase of books with her. They&rsquo;re taken to the Hotel Eden on Kurf&uuml;rstendamm, today&rsquo;s Budapester Stra&szlig;e 35, which houses a division of the Freikorps. Liebknecht is brought in around 9.30, Luxemburg half an hour later.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They&rsquo;re both taken to the interrogation room on the first floor. 38-year-old Captain Waldemar Pabst interrogates them separately. Luxemburg is clearly exhausted by the events of the last few days. She looks gaunt, with dark circles under her eyes. When Pabst ask whether she is really Rosa Luxemburg, she simply says: &ldquo;Decide for yourself&rdquo; <sup>1 </sup>and starts sewing up the hem of her skirt, which was torn during her arrest. And she reads Goethe&#39;s <em>Faust </em>&ndash; for the very last time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Transportation and murder </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During Luxemburg&rsquo;s interrogation, soldiers take Liebknecht down to the foyer around 10.45 pm. At the side exit, soldier Otto Runge strikes him twice in the face with his rifle butt. Bleeding, he is led to the car. Lieutenant Pflugk-Harttung&rsquo;s official orders are to take Liebknecht to Moabit prison. But instead he heads for the Tiergarten. Under the pretext of a flat tyre, the soldiers stop the car and tell Liebknecht to get out. Pflugk-Harttung pretends to release Liebknecht, but then shoots him in the back of the head at close range. Three other soldiers also fire at him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Lieutenant Vogel takes Rosa Luxemburg outside shortly before midnight, she has no inkling of Liebknecht&#39;s fate. Runge once more swings his rifle butt, and she loses consciousness. She&#39;s still alive as she&#39;s driven away in an open-top car, but just 40 metres from the hotel, Lieutenant Hermann Souchon takes out his pistol and shoots her. The soldiers throw her lifeless body into the Landwehr Canal near the Lichtenstein Bridge. Today, a memorial to Rosa Luxemburg stands on this spot near the bridge.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>A German Jewish scientist living and working in Berlin in the 1920s, renowned the world over and respected for his research &ndash; does that remind you of anyone? It might first sound like acknowledged genius Albert Einstein, but it equally applies to sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld, a pioneer of gender studies and icon of the gay movement.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p><strong>Tolerance instead of homophobia </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the contemporary American press, physician Markus Hirschfeld is dubbed the &ldquo;Einstein of sex&rdquo;. His own motto is the far less sensational &ldquo;Justice through Science&rdquo;. Hirschfeld dedicates his life to researching love and sexuality, its techniques and practices, and diversity and extremes. In early July 1919, to further his research, Hirschfeld founds his Institute of Sexual Research &ndash; a previously unimaginable institution seeking to fight prejudice with science and homophobia with information.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Institute itself takes an approach as diverse as the categories of <em>sexual intermediary</em> which Hirschfeld defines. The researchers include biologists, forensic scientists, gynaecologists and anthropologists all working under one roof. These include, for instance, respected psychiatrist Arthur Kronfeld, who offers consultations, or his successor, dermatologist Bernhard Schapiro, who experiments with remedies against impotence, or physician and sex educator Max Hodann who offers sex counselling. The Institute not only treats venereal disease, hormone disorders and potency problems, but also offers marriage counselling, seminars and consultancy services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Institute also carries out surgical sex change operations. In the second half of the 1920s, in addition to its programme of medical care, the Institute increasingly takes on an active public role. The educational programme includes sex education films, advice evenings on contraception as well as group tours through the library and archive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hirschfeld&rsquo;s work in sex education is often fiercely condemned, and he himself is repeatedly the victim of verbal and physical violence. At the same time, the call for sexual reform also attracts illustrious guests. The evening events in the Institute&rsquo;s rooms are attended by Dada artists, writers, dancers and philosophers such as Andr&eacute; Gide, Christopher Isherwood, Anita Berber and Walter Benjamin. Film director Sergei Eisenstein is said to have visited, as well as the elderly playwright and writer Gerhart Hauptmann.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A vanished location </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The former site of the Institute of Sexual Research is now almost forgotten in Tiergarten. The Institute once stood at the intersection of the two streets In den Zelten/Beethovenstra&szlig;e, but both have long since disappeared. Since 1957, this area has been the site of Berlin&rsquo;s former Congress Hall, since 1989 the Haus der Kulturen der Welt cultural centre. Hirschfeld&rsquo;s Institute was east of here, located in a triangle formed by the venue Tipi am Kanzleramt and the Federal Chancellery. There, in one of the best locations, it was housed in two town mansions linked by a central corner house set slightly back from the pavement. The interiors were inspired by an elegant classicism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, there are sites commemorating Hirschfeld&rsquo;s life and work directly in the vicinity. If you follow the curve of the River Spree to the west toward Bellevue Palace, you find a rust-coloured memorial column just a five-minute walk away, directly opposite the boat jetty. On the other river bank, a path is named after Magnus Hirschfeld close to a memorial for the first homosexual emancipation movement.</p>\r\n",

Its ambience is reminiscent of a station concourse, the food is bad, the floor is filthy and the air smoky. There&rsquo;s also a strict hierarchy. A distinction is made between the <em>Schwimmerbassin (swimmers&rsquo; pool)</em>, which is frequented by the regulars, and the <em>Nichtschwimmerbecken (non-swimmers&rsquo; pool)</em>, where strangers are allowed to sit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But people are attracted by the fact that they can sit for hours over a single cup of coffee.

Artists flock to sit with Impressionist painter Max Slevogt, whose table is occasionally graced by the presence of Max Liebermann. Journalists and critics meet up here, though the influential critic Alfred Kerr rarely shows up because his reviews have usually upset one or other of the regulars. It&rsquo;s a regular haunt of actress Carola Neher and her husband, the poet known as Klabund. Gabriele Tergit describes the cafe in her novel <em>K&auml;sebier </em>erobert den <em>Kurf&uuml;rstendamm</em>. Director and screenwriter Robert Siodmak recalls how the cafe sparked the idea for his film <em>Menschen am Sonntag</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some guests, the coffee house is a way of life. Bohemian artist John H&ouml;xter is part of the furniture, spending his days scrounging from table to table.

"introtext": "<p>Just before eleven in the morning, in the upmarket suburb of Grunewald, shots ring out, closely followed by an explosion. It&rsquo;s Saturday, 24 June 1922. The shots are fired at Germany&rsquo;s Foreign Minister, Walther Rathenau. The assassins shoot from a car as it overtakes the Foreign Minister&#39;s open-top vehicle on a bend. Rathenau dies in his car, hit by five bullets and a hand grenade.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p><strong>The murdered minister </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walther Rathenau was the son of AEG-founder Emil Rathenau, and a member of the company&rsquo;s board. He was also a well-known journalist and keen to be involved in politics. At the start of World War I, he was responsible for organising the war economy at the Prussian War Ministry. After the war he was appointed Minister for Reconstruction, and then Foreign Minister.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Rathenau&#39;s views and political actions tend to polarise public opinion. He is regularly the target of severe anti-Semitic attacks by right-wing nationalist groups and the recipient of defamatory letters and death threats. Despite this, he often refuses police protection, as is the case on the day of his assassination.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The fleeing assassins </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>News of the assassination spreads quickly, with all the Berlin newspapers headlining it in their evening editions. The perpetrators are also quickly tracked down. The accomplices and the driver of the car are arrested within a week and the police clarify the sequence of events. But the two shooters are still on the run. A huge manhunt is led by Bernhard Wei&szlig;, Vice-President of the Berlin police, but the assassins manage to escape on bikes to Saaleck Castle in what is now Saxony-Anhalt. But the police eventually catch up with student Erwin Kern, who is killed in an exchange of fire, and mechanical engineer Hermann Fischer, who later shoots himself.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The men behind it </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The subsequent court proceedings were unable to prove what we now know &ndash; the three young men in the car were acting on the orders of the Organisation Consul, a monarchist, anti-republican secret society under the leadership of Hermann Ehrhardt. The group made regular attempts to undermine democracy with a series of politically motivated attacks. The secret organisation was also behind the assassination of Centre Party politician Matthias Erzberger and the assassination attempt on Social Democrat Philipp Scheidemann. As far as they are concerned, Rathenau is the &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; victim &ndash; he is a representative of the Republic; they oppose his policy of reconciliation with the victorious Allies; and they hate him because he&rsquo;s Jewish.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The fall-out from the crime </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the Organisation Consul fails to achieve the real goal of the assassination &ndash; the destabilisation of the Republic. The hoped-for chaos does not break out over the following days and weeks. In fact, supporters of the Republic &ndash; at least temporarily &ndash; close ranks in the wake of the assassination. Millions of people across Germany join funeral marches and even call a general strike. The newly created Constitutional Court hands down long prison sentences to the surviving accomplices to the murder. Chancellor Joseph Wirth, Centre Party member, sounds more like a Social Democrat in his speech to the Reichstag, saying: &ldquo;The enemy is on the right.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup></p>\r\n",

The myth of dying a glorious, heroic death for the fatherland is contrasted with the horrific reality of industrial mass murder. Soon after the museum opens in October 1925, the police arrive and remove pictures of deformed faces, mutilated bodies and shattered corpses from the display window.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The shocking pictures come from Friedrich&#39;s book <em>Krieg dem Kriege! (War Against War!)</em>, which brings him international attention in 1924. He uses the proceeds from this bestseller to set up the &ldquo;first international anti-war museum&rdquo; in a dilapidated house in Parochialstra&szlig;e. Photos of victims and perpetrators are placed next to drawings by Otto Dix and K&auml;the Kollwitz. Weapons, medals and war toys are displayed alongside ration cards and prostheses, all accompanied by sarcastic captions. German and French steel helmets have been turned into flower pots. Above the entrance hangs the symbol of conscientious objectors &ndash; two hands holding aloft a broken rifle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;From peace museum to Hitler barracks&rdquo; <sup>2 </sup></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a conscientious objector, Ernst Friedrich is initially sent to prison during the First World War, and then committed to an asylum. After his release in November 1918, he campaigns against the state and the military, against enforced obedience and violence. His passionate commitment to peace in his lectures and writings soon brings the &ldquo;peace agitator&rdquo; <sup>3 </sup>back into conflict with the authorities. A dozen court cases result in him spending three years in prison, but they also bring Friedrich into the public eye. It is rare to see a soldier in his museum, but he has more success with children and teenagers. For some, such as the futurologist Robert Jungk, a visit to the Anti-War Museum becomes a life-changing event.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the final years of the Weimar Republic, Friedrich increasingly finds himself fighting a losing battle. In 1930 he is sentenced to one year in prison. The windows of his museum are smashed, and he is injured in one of the attacks. The sign &quot;Closed due to chronic pecuniary embarrassment!&rdquo; appears more regularly in the window. <sup>4 </sup>In February 1933, the SA storm the museum, destroy the exhibits and set up a torture chamber in the cellar. Friedrich is taken into protective custody and eventually flees the country in December. Before long, the destruction of the reminders of the atrocities of one World War is followed by the murder and devastation of another.</p>\r\n",

Newspaper tycoon Rudolf Mosse&rsquo;s new advertising-based business model turned his publishing company into a rich, powerful concern.

Mosse decides it should not be merely renovated, but radically rebuilt. He hires young architect Erich Mendelsohn to draw up the plans. His designs are bold and futuristic, an expression of the new, fast-paced age. Mendelsohn adds two storeys of modern steel-reinforced concrete to the original sandstone building and creates a streamlined, curved corner with wide glass windows. The building reflects the movement of people and traffic on the street below. Mendelsohn has given the building wings! The frontage protrudes over the street corner like the bow of a ship. Puffing out its chest, it proudly sets sail for new horizons. The building work begins in late 1921, but the construction is not allowed to interfere with editorial operations. Relocating or temporarily suspending operations is unthinkable for a major publishing house like Mosse.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Death comes from above </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the building work nears completion, disaster strikes out of the blue. On the morning of 24 January 1923, the upper floor suddenly collapses. Great piles of gravel and cement were being stored on the newly concreted roof. They soak up the rain during the night and their weight causes the upper floor to cave in. An avalanche of rubble sweeps through eight storeys, destroying everything in its path. On the fourth floor it picks up a heavy metal cabinet, which crashes down on the unsuspecting staff working in the newspaper offices below.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the dust settles, 13 employees are dead and 11 others are seriously injured. Reporting on the disaster in their own offices, stunned journalists from the <em>Berliner Tageblatt</em> newspaper describe hearing cries for help from the piles of rubble and iron girders, which have been &ldquo;bent like matchsticks by the sheer force of the catastrophe&rdquo;. An editorial secretary recounts how women and men struggled out of the building, &ldquo;panic-stricken, dust-covered and with a look of horror on their faces&rdquo;. <sup>1 </sup>A gaping, ten-metre hole now splits the Mossehaus from roof to basement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Mosse steamship </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the court case that follows, nine men from the construction company are charged with causing manslaughter and bodily harm due to criminal negligence. A master builder is jailed for six months, while two foremen receive two-month sentences. Their sentences are reduced because of inadequate regulations and their lack of experience with the materials involved. Despite the tragedy, Mendelsohn&#39;s building is hailed as an architectural triumph: &ldquo;The good ship Rudolf Mosse is steaming down Jerusalemer Stra&szlig;e&rdquo;. <sup>2</sup></p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>1 February 1933, Berlin. The crackling of static on the radio. The programme of the <em>Funkstunde</em>, the first German radio broadcaster, has just started. The speaker is the young pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer, just 26 years old. His voice rings out, definite and firm. Two days after Hitler&rsquo;s seizure of power, Bonhoeffer gives a radio address on the &ldquo;Younger Generation&rsquo;s Altered View of the Concept of F&uuml;hrer&rdquo;. Bonhoeffer never once mentions Hitler&rsquo;s name, but his listeners know who he means. He says that a leader who becomes his followers&rsquo; idol easily turns into a &lsquo;misleader&rsquo;. These are courageous words. Suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, the broadcast is cut off.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>Dietrich Bonhoeffer stands up against state injustice, opposes the principle of the F&uuml;hrer&rsquo;s word as above all written law, and speaks out against the persecution of the Jews. In the internal struggle in the Protestant Church, he is active in the opposition to Hitler&rsquo;s church party, the German Christians. Together with others including Martin Niem&ouml;ller, he plays a crucial role in supporting the Confessing Church which opposes the Nazi regime&rsquo;s plan for a single pro-Nazi Protestant Reich Church.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pastoral care and resistance </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dietrich Bonhoeffer has been working as a pastor in Berlin for several years. He preaches at the St. Mathew&rsquo;s Church in Tiergarten, and looks after a group preparing for confirmation at the Zionskirche church in the Mitte district. His work for the Zionskirche parish and his later activities in the resistance against the Nazis are honoured by an exhibition in the church and a sculpture. You can find the sculpture if you go to the left around the church past the entrance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The way to freedom&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1936, Bonhoeffer is forbidden to work as a teacher. This is soon followed by a ban on publishing and public speaking. He is also banned from staying in Berlin. Several times he has the chance to flee Germany. But he stays with his parish, even though he knows his efforts for freedom can cost him his life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through Hans von Dohnanyi, a schoolfriend and later his brother-in-law, Dietrich Bonhoeffer is enlisted by the disaffected Abwehr military counter-intelligence unit headed by Admiral Canaris. There, he comes into contact with groups in the German military resistance. He cultivates contacts to the Kreisau Circle of dissidents around Helmuth von Moltke. In 1941 and 1942, Bonhoeffer travels to Norway, Sweden and Switzerland as a courier for the resistance. As a representative of the resistance against Hitler, his task is to contact the Allies abroad. In 1943, Bonhoeffer is entangled in an attempt to assassinate Hitler by the group around Admiral Canaris.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Gestapo uncover the conspiracy, arresting Bonhoeffer and his brother-in-law Hans von Dohnanyi for sedition and subversion of the war effort.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In prison, Bonhoeffer writes many poems, including <em>Stations on the Way to Freedom</em>. Freedom means daring to do what is right, and taking up responsibility &ndash; and it transcends the private sphere. Bonhoeffer also calls for direct political action since &ldquo;mere waiting and looking on is not Christian behaviour&ldquo;. <sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1944, since he is classified as a &ldquo;personal prisoner of Hitler&rdquo;, Bonhoeffer is interrogated at the Gestapo headquarters in Prinz-Albrecht-Stra&szlig;e. He is sent to Buchenwald and then to Flossenb&uuml;rg concentration camp. Shortly before the end of the war, he is summarily court-martialled and sentenced to death. The sentence is carried out on the morning of 9 April 1945. As a final humiliation, he and the other condemned prisoners have to walk out naked to the gallows.</p>\r\n",

German-Jewish artist Max Liebermann can view the scene directly from his apartment at Pariser Platz 7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With characteristic bluntness, Liebermann does not mince his words: &ldquo;I cannot eat as much as I want to vomit.&rdquo; <sup>1 </sup>For over 40 years, he and his family have been living in his parent&rsquo;s home at Pariser Platz. The house is the work of August St&uuml;ler, a well-known student of Berlin&rsquo;s renowned architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel &ndash; built at a time when the Brandenburg Gate still marked the city boundary. Once when asked for the address, Liebermann laconically replies: &ldquo;First house on your left in Berlin&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the prominent buildings around include the French Embassy and Hotel Adlon. In his day, German writer Thomas Mann calls Liebermann&rsquo;s house &ldquo;a focal and gathering point for refreshing and influential personalities&rdquo;. <sup>2</sup>&nbsp; Liebermann builds a glass studio at the top of his house &ndash; and the German Emperor tries to ban it for infringing building law. But Liebermann fights for his rights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For many years, Liebermann dominates the German art world. In 1920, he is even elected President of the Prussian Academy of Arts &ndash; the institution he rebelled against in his youth. As leader of the Berlin Secession artists&rsquo; group, he belongs to the avantgarde. When the Nazis seize power in 1933, Jewish artists are banned from exhibiting. Liebermann resigns from his office as Academy President. Two years later, he dies in his house at Pariser Platz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The building is destroyed in Allied bombing raids. Today&rsquo;s Max Liebermann Haus is a new post-Wall building, designed by Josef Paul Kleihues, and inspired by the historical original. Since 2000, this has housed the Stiftung Brandenburger Tor (Brandenburg Gate Foundation). In Liebermann&rsquo;s spirit, the Foundation supports artistic projects. Why not visit and see for yourself!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Summer residence on Wannsee lake</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1909, Max Liebermann buys a vast plot of land along Berlin&rsquo;s Wannsee lake. Today, surrounded by attractive villas, this is one of the last open lakeside areas. Here, Liebermann builds his summer residence, finished in just a few months. He called it &lsquo;my palace on the lake&rsquo;<sup>3</sup>&nbsp; &ndash; a place where he is exceptionally productive. In the months he spends here with his family every summer, he paints over 200 works. Rather like Monet, he draws his inspiration, above all, from his garden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, reconstructed from Liebermann&rsquo;s paintings to create an artistic unity, the beautiful lakeside house, exhibition area, garden and caf&eacute; are open to the public.</p>\r\n",

In October 1932, this famous school of design, art and architecture left Dessau and moved to Germany&rsquo;s capital city. The Bauhaus, founded in 1919 in Weimar by the architect Walter Gropius, is renowned for its modernist furniture and architecture. In 1925, with Thuringia&rsquo;s conservative government cutting its funding, the Bauhaus School moves to Dessau. Yet even before the seizure of power by the National Socialists in 1933, Dessau&rsquo;s City Council has a right-wing majority. The city councillors fiercely condemn the Bauhaus as decadent, cosmopolitan and Bolshevist. In 1932, the Nazi Party in Dessau&rsquo;s city council forces through the closure of the Bauhaus.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The teachers at the Bauhaus decide on Berlin as the new location. In the Lankwitz district, the Bauhaus rents a former telephone factory. But it still lacks all the equipment. They make a virtue out of necessity &ndash; and the first semester is declared as practical experience. The students clear the building, then set to work using their craft skills. They transform the factory into a college building. In early January 1933, the courses can start.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Nazi regime piles the pressure on the Bauhaus </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 30 January 1933, the National Socialists under Hitler seize power in Germany. The spirit of the Bauhaus School is inspired by modernism and the Neues Bauen architectural movement &ndash; all anathema to the Nazis. The newspapers talk of the Bauhaus School as a poisonous communist cell. When police search the building in April 1933, they only find four copies of <em>Die Weltb&uuml;hne</em>, a left-wing weekly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, head of the Bauhaus, refuses to give in. He goes to see Alfred Rosenberg, Hitler&rsquo;s chief ideologue. Rosenberg is head of the Militant League for German Culture (KfdK), and fobs Mies van der Rohe off. But the Bauhaus director then even goes to talk to the Gestapo. Bauhaus students try to contact Joseph Goebbels, Hitler&rsquo;s Propaganda Minister. The result? The Bauhaus School can only be reopened if two of the teachers, Ludwig Hilberseimer and Wassily Kandinsky, are fired.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are new teachers &ldquo;firmly rooted in the ideas of National Socialism&rdquo; <sup>1 </sup>ready to take over their positions. But the Bauhaus management refuses. It would mean the end of free and independent teaching. To pre-empt the Nazi authorities from dissolving the college, Mies van der Rohe himself declares the Bauhaus closed. Many of its teachers and students leave Berlin.</p>\r\n",

Shortly after 9pm, sirens are heard in the inner city &ndash; the Reichstag, the German parliament building, is on fire! The fire services arrive quickly, but too late to save the building. A fateful night for democracy in Germany. The Reichstag fire comes to symbolise the Nazi seizure of power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p><strong>The Reichstag is burning </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just thirty minutes after the fire starts, the core of the building is almost beyond rescue. The Nazis openly disparage the German parliament. For them, it is just a &ldquo;talking shop&rdquo; &ndash; and now the parliament building is in flames. The police find a young Dutchman inside, and arrest him as a prime suspect. His name is Marinus van der Lubbe, a communist supporter. Had he really set fire to this massive building all on his own?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his first interrogation, he describes in detail how he set the fire. He climbed through a window on the west side of the Reichstag, setting fire to the curtains, wooden panelling and desks. As he went through the building, he used his shirt as a burning torch. Soon curtains, tapestries, carpets, and tablecloths were all on fire. After less than thirty minutes, van der Lubbe walks straight into the arms of two guards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s set to work. Everything&rsquo;s bright. That&rsquo;s what we need!&rdquo;&nbsp; Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels is thrilled. The Nazis immediately see the propaganda potential of the Reichstag fire. Now, they have an excuse to eliminate their political opponents. Just a few hours after the fire, they arrest hundreds of Communist party functionaries in Berlin. In the course of the day, Hitler&rsquo;s cabinet suspends basic democratic rights. From now on, anyone can be arrested without specific charges. The Nazis claim the country must be protected against a Communist putsch. The tolerance marking Germany in the 1920s is thrown overboard. There is an end to press freedom and freedom of opinion. President von Hindenburg approves the emergency decree ushering in a wave of terror. The measures under the so-called Reichstag Fire Decree turn Germany into a dictatorship.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>At odds over historical events&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In December 1933, a Leipzig court sentences Marinus van der Lubbe to death for arson and treason. Since then, historians have argued over the Reichstag fire. Did van der Lubbe really set the fire alone? Did he have helpers? Was he working for someone else? And what role did the Nazis play? After all, they profited most from the fire.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For years, a secret underground tunnel connects the Reichstag with the palatial residence of the Reichstag President &ndash; in 1933, Herman G&ouml;ring. So could G&ouml;ring have sent his SA or SS henchmen through the tunnel?&nbsp; No surviving historical documents prove the Nazis were involved in the fire &ndash; and even fire experts believe Marinus van der Lubbe could have acted alone.</p>\r\n",

Today, you can explore the history of the site at the Topography of Terror exhibition.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p><strong>A place of terror&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The area around Wilhelmstra&szlig;e develops from the eighteenth century. Before 1933, it can boast elaborate town residences, the ethnological museum, an Arts and Crafts College and the exclusive Hotel Prinz Albrecht. Prussia&rsquo;s renowned architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel and landscaper Peter Joseph Lenn&eacute; design the adjacent square.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 8 November 1934, Reich SS Leader Heinrich Himmler takes over the Hotel Prinz Albrecht with his personal command staff. Himmler also moves the SS Administrative Main Office here as well as the SS Central Office and the SS Personnel Main Office. The Prinz Albrecht complex, as it is called, is home to the Gestapo headquarters, the SS Security Service and later the SS Reich Security Main Office. Himmler is a leading figure in the Nazi hierarchy. He systematically fights all those critical of the Nazi regime. As Reich SS Leader and Chief of the German Police, Himmler plays a key role in supporting Hitler&rsquo;s machinery of power. From here, with its system of concentration camps, the Nazi regime implements its policies of the persecution and extermination of political and &ldquo;racial&rdquo; opponents in the German Reich and occupied territories. Here too, plans are forged for the mass murder of European Jews and the war of ideologies and extermination in eastern and south-eastern Europe.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, no buildings are left on the site from the pre-war period. Instead, the site is home to an exhibition and a Documentation Center. Go through the main entrance to the Topography of Terror exhibition next to the Martin-Gropius-Bau building, and walk down the steps. You are now standing in the former Prinz-Albrecht-Palais basement. Almost as soon as Hitler seizes power, these cells are packed with political prisoners. The Gestapo have 38 solitary cells and one communal cell in their headquarters, and often use brutal torture methods to interrogate the prisoners. In the twelve years of the Nazi regime, over 15,000 prisoners pass through these cells. After interrogation, many of the prisoners are sent to the concentration camps.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The traces of the past&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take a look behind the Martin-Gropius-Bau building. Here too there are traces of Berlin&rsquo;s history. You can see the remains of former buildings on the site and the prison walls. At the end of the little used path through a copse of locust trees, you can find the remains of two monumental structures for the Reich Security Main Office.</p>\r\n",

Minister for Aviation Hermann G&ouml;ring strides across the forecourt. Curious employees lean out of the windows of his ministry. It is 16 March 1937, the second anniversary of the reintroduction of Germany&rsquo;s right to military rearmament. G&ouml;ring steps up to the microphone for a radio broadcast and reports on the successful rearmament of Germany&rsquo;s Air Force.

This new ministry is set up to work on building a national air force, one of the key steps to becoming a military superpower. This is prohibited under the Treaty of Versailles. But after two years of secret rearmament, Hitler declares Germany&rsquo;s right to military rearmament at the Nuremberg Reich Party Congress. What he actually means by this is the country&rsquo;s right to rearm in contravention of existing treaties.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1935, the new German Luftwaffe gets its own ministry building on Wilhelmstra&szlig;e. It is one of the Nazi&rsquo;s first monumental building projects. More than 1,000 workers toil on the construction site, working around the clock in three shifts. An entire city block is demolished and cleared and work on the new Aviation Ministry begins on eight different sites. The reinforced concrete building goes up quickly thanks the latest construction methods. For the Nazis, it is one of the key construction sites of the new era &ndash; an expression of their power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A building with a chequered history </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are now standing where Hermann G&ouml;ring and the architect, Erich Sagebiel, officially opened the building in July 1936, shortly before the opening of the Olympic Games. Imagine two huge imperial eagles on their pedestals and swastika flags flying on the roof. Otherwise, nothing much has changed. G&ouml;ring is happy with the building. He praises its &ldquo;austere lines as an expression of the austere spirit that governs us all today&rdquo;. <sup>1 </sup>With more than 2,000 rooms, the Ministry is one of the biggest office buildings in Europe. But &ldquo;Fat Hermann&rdquo; is rarely found at work in his Berlin fortress. He doesn&#39;t even have a proper office there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The state rooms have been preserved to this day. The dark wood panelling of the small banqueting hall has witnessed many stories and occupants over the years. Ironically, the building where the bombing of Europe was planned and organised survived the war largely unscathed. It has remained in uninterrupted use to this day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its thick walls have housed more than 80 years of political history. G&ouml;ring&rsquo;s Ministry of Aviation was succeeded by the Soviet military administration, then on 7 October 1949 the building provided the location for the GDR&rsquo;s official founding ceremony. It changed its name to the House of Ministries. After the fall of the GDR, the building became the headquarters of the Treuhand, an agency for restructuring East Germany&rsquo;s state-owned industries after reunification. Today, it houses the German Ministry of Finance.</p>\r\n",

Many fathers and sons are still fighting on the front. Joseph Goebbels walks out onto the Propaganda Ministry balcony. On Vo&szlig;stra&szlig;e, Hitler&rsquo;s massive Reich Chancellery dominates the skyline. A vast banner hangs down the Propaganda Ministry fa&ccedil;ade. The message it bears is written large: &ldquo;Our Militia Fights for the Life and Freedom of Greater Germany!&rdquo; Underneath, Goebbels looks down at the waiting crowds. Then, he walks over to the microphone.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>The Third Reich&rsquo;s military defeat has been certain for months. But the Nazi leadership is determined to fight to the last drop of blood. Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels is the &ldquo;Reich Commissioner for Total War Mobilisation&rdquo;. <sup>1 </sup>He calls for unconditional sacrifice from the Volkssturm &ndash; the euphemistic name for a national militia comprising an army of badly equipped children and old men. Cannon fodder for Hitler&rsquo;s bloody final stage of the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Freedom of opinion in chains </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels belongs to the old guard of the Nazi party, joining in the very early years. In 1926, Hitler entrusts Goebbels with a challenging task. Goebbels is appointed Gauleiter (district leader) of Berlin. With the support of the local SA &ldquo;Brownshirts&rdquo;, he begins to create and expand a Nazi power base in Germany&rsquo;s capital city, known as a left-wing bastion of social democrats and communists. With the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, he achieves his initial goal. Now, Goebbels aspires to a seat in Hitler&rsquo;s cabinet with his own ministry &ndash; and becomes head of the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, one of the Nazi regime&rsquo;s key pillars. He can now sway public opinion almost at will.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ministry&rsquo;s key tasks are the control of the entire German media &ndash; the press, broadcasting, visual arts, film and theatre. It is no longer possible to freely form an opinion. Aware of the power of wireless as a propaganda channel, Goebbels makes production of the affordable <em>Volksempf&auml;nger (&ldquo;people&rsquo;s receiver&rdquo;) </em>a priority. In no time, the locals have nicknamed this radio the <em>Goebbelsschnauze</em>, which roughly translates as &ldquo;Goebbels&rsquo; gob&rdquo; &ndash; and it lives up to its name with an unbroken stream of propaganda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wilhelmplatz square disappears</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1933, the Propaganda Ministry moves to Wilhelmplatz square into a large town house known as the Ordenspalais &ndash; the Palace of the Order of St. John. But with staff numbers rapidly growing, the building soon proves too small. Until shortly after the outbreak of war, architect Karl Reichle oversees a new monumental building with a series of annexes. Wilhelmplatz serves the Nazis as a central destination for their marches. Here, massed crowds also gather to listen to speeches by Goebbels and Hitler.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Towards the end of war, much of the complex is destroyed in bombing raids. The reconstruction has primarily focused on the tract of buildings designed by Reichle. When East Germany is founded, the building houses the National Front of the German Democratic Republic, a satellite party of the ruling SED. This also becomes the official residence of Wilhelm Pieck, the first president of the GDR. Today, the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (BMAS) uses the sections of buildings once housing the Nazi Propaganda Ministry. Wilhelmplatz square, as shown on the historic photo, no longer exists.</p>\r\n",

He orders Albert Speer, his General Building Inspector, to design and build a new Chancellery reflecting the Third Reich&rsquo;s aspiration to world power. Speer has an entire street at his disposal for his design. The new Reich Chancellery is to stretch 500 metres. So if you walk down all of Vo&szlig;strasse, you get a feeling of just how vast this building was.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Working without a break </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A brochure published to mark the opening of the Reich Chancellery contains the lines, &ldquo;The F&uuml;hrer&rsquo;s Reich Chancellery is built overnight, there Professor Speer has created a masterpiece!&rdquo;. <sup>2 </sup>Not surprisingly, the new Chancellery takes more than one night to construct, although it is built within a year &ndash; quite an achievement. The workers are on site in shifts, day and night, every weekend, and every public holiday. The costs spiral to three times the original budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hitler&rsquo;s new Reich Chancellery opens its doors for a New Year reception. The reception rooms are designed to impress &ndash; but there is still scaffolding in the offices on the upper floor. The Reich Chancellery is not functional, and hardly used in the years afterwards. But it is a symbol of Hitler&rsquo;s power.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hitler is especially impressed by the long marble gallery, twice as long as the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles &ndash; a place hated by the Nazis as the scene of signing the Treaty of Versailles that ends the First World War. &ldquo;On the long walk from the entrance to the reception hall, they&rsquo;ll get a taste of the power and grandeur of the German Reich!&rdquo;, <sup>3 </sup>Hitler says to Speer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nothing left to see </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Second World War, the Reich Chancellery is less damaged than many buildings in the vicinity. Its ruins become a tourist attraction. Before the Potsdam Conference, both British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and US President Harry S. Truman come by to view it. Then work starts on demolishing this monolith &ndash; and takes seven times as long as it did to build it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Berlin Wall goes up, the open site of the former Reich Chancellery becomes part of the border area, lost in no man&rsquo;s land. Shortly before the Wall falls, East Germany constructs some prefabricated concrete-slab apartment blocks on the eastern section of Vo&szlig;stra&szlig;e. The tower blocks are still there today. In search of the remains of the Reich Chancellery, tourist groups often visit the tube station at Mohrenstra&szlig;e. The red marble there seems suspiciously similar to the materials used for the Reich Chancellery. But historians have shown there is actually no connection. There really is nothing left to see of the Third Reich&rsquo;s once monumental symbol of power.</p>\r\n",

With its shimmering reddish-brown fa&ccedil;ade, it stands out from the grey buildings all around. From inside comes the sound of hammering and the voices of German and Italian construction workers. This prestigious building project at the heart of the Third Reich is nearly finished &ndash; the new Italian Embassy.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p><strong>New diplomatic quarter&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is to be the most impressive embassy in the city&rsquo;s new diplomatic quarter. Adolf Hitler and his architect Albert Speer have drawn up a plan to turn Berlin into the new capital of the Reich, to be called Germania. But entire districts, including many embassy buildings, stand in their way. So Speer decides to build a new diplomatic quarter in the western part of the Tiergarten district to accommodate twelve embassies and residences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best locations and largest plots are reserved for Germany&rsquo;s closest allies: Italy and Japan. Hitler has a particularly close political alliance with the Italy&rsquo;s Duce, Benito Mussolini. The Italian embassy is due to be built at one end of Siegesallee. This &ldquo;Victory Avenue&rdquo; runs to the Victory Column, which has recently been moved to its new location in the Gro&szlig;er Stern square.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Construction work on the embassy begins in 1938. The architect is a German, Friedrich Hetzelt. But the Italians are involved in drawing up the plans and hold frequent meetings with Hetzelt. The results are clear when you look at the fa&ccedil;ade. The front of the building is faced with travertine, a type of stone from Tivoli. Marble from the Strona Valley has been used for the stairs and terraces at the rear. The Italian Embassy resembles a Renaissance palazzo.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The party is over&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1939. Work on the building grinds to a halt just before it is completed. Germany has declared war on the world. The construction workers have to go off to fight. Building materials become scarce. But Hitler wants to show his respect for the Duce and insists the embassy has to be finished. So construction resumes with the help of Italian builders from Volkswagen in Wolfsburg. In autumn 1942, Renaissance doorways and sections of French wooden wall panels are delivered to ensure the interior is as magnificent as the exterior. Electrically operated dumb waiters are standing by, ready for the glitzy opening ceremony.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the party is cancelled. There&rsquo;s a war on, so it&rsquo;s not a good time to be swilling champagne and scoffing canap&eacute;s. Architect Friedrich Hetzelt and an Italian colleague simply sign off the building and it&rsquo;s ready to move in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the Italian ambassador barely has time to get his feet under the table before the building is bombed. After the war, the Tiergarten diplomatic quarter falls into a deep sleep. Children use the ruins as an adventure playground. Part of one wing is renovated to accommodate the Italian Consulate General.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1990. After German reunification, Italy is determined to rebuild the embassy. It reopens in 2003, part of a brand new embassy district in the Tiergarten.</p>\r\n",

As always, the restaurant is bustling. The waiters hurry from table to table. The smell of fried steak fills the room. Several SS officers in uniform are waiting for their order. At the same time, Walter Unger is sitting at a table in a neighbouring room, gaunt and pale, his suit now far too big for his emaciated body. Unger is co-owner of Kempinski, brought here especially from Sachsenhausen concentration camp &ndash; but only to agree to the further Aryanisation of his business.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p><strong>Cosmopolitan flair on Ku&rsquo;damm boulevard </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1926, the doors of the Kempinski Restaurant open. The guests stream into this new culinary palace, dedicated to good food. Every day, the restaurant is packed. The open-air terrace is especially popular with locals. The cars roar past, and women with bobbed hair and men in frock coats stroll the boulevard. And inside? The local <em>Berliner Zeitung</em> newspaper enthuses: &ldquo;A marvel of architecture &hellip; sophisticated and welcoming, yet as the Berliner would say, really cosy&rdquo;. <sup>1 </sup>Business is booming. For the Kempinski family business, their Kurf&uuml;rstendamm restaurant is the jewel in the crown in a chain of fine hotels and restaurants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1863, Berthold Kempinski, a Jewish businessman from Posen in today&rsquo;s Poland, founds a wine merchant shop. In 1872, he opens a branch in Berlin&#39;s Friedrichstra&szlig;e, followed by restaurants in Leipziger Strasse and on Kurf&uuml;rstendamm. In 1928, the Kempinski business takes over the Hotel Vaterland at Potsdamer Platz.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The golden years end in 1933. Across Germany, the Nazi regime organises boycotts of Jewish shops and businesses &ndash; a campaign also affecting the restaurant. At the same time, they start the &ldquo;Aryanisation&rdquo; &ndash; the compulsory sale &ndash; of Jewish firms. Large companies like Kempinski are not initially targeted &ndash; they are too important for the German economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A tragic end </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1937, Richard Unger, Berthold Kempinski&rsquo;s son-in-law, has to negotiate the forced sale of the Kempinski group. Aschinger, one of Europe&rsquo;s largest hotel and restaurant companies, is keen to take it over. Aschinger promises &ldquo;top quality at the lowest prices&rdquo; &ndash; and has strong business links with the Nazi regime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 29 April 1937, after protracted negotiations, the Kempinski business becomes a limited company, a subsidiary of Aschinger. The Kempinski family no longer have a say in the business. Nearly all the family members leave Germany. Walter Unger, the son of the main shareholder, remains in Germany to wind up the business. He hopes to save parts of it &ndash; a vain hope.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1938, Walter Unger is arrested and taken to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. In January 1939, he is brought back to the Kempinski Restaurant once more, for the final renegotiation. Four years later, Walter Unger is deported as number 014387 to Theresienstadt concentration camp. In 1944, he is murdered in Auschwitz.</p>\r\n",

General Building Inspector Albert Speer is pleased with his choice of gift. Years earlier, Hitler had given him a sketch of a triumphal arch that he had drawn himself. Now it is to be the centrepiece of the new imperial capital of Germania. The arch never gets built, but Berlin still bears the traces of this gigantic building project.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>The sheer size of the world&rsquo;s biggest triumphal arch Is hard to grasp. The Arc de Triomphe in Paris would fit into it several times. But that&rsquo;s also a worry for Albert Speer &ndash; is it actually structurally possible to build such an arch?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sandy Berlin&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The General Building Inspector has a problem. Unlike other major European cities, Berlin is not built on rock, but on sand. That presents something of a challenge for his building plans. To be on the safe side, Speer orders the construction of a test load structure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are now standing on a viewing platform on General-Pape-Strasse. If you look to the north, you will see a huge grey cylinder sticking out of the ground between the trees. This is the structure now known as the Heavy Load-Bearing Body. Its only function was to simulate the weight of the planned triumphal arch and the pressure it would exert on Berlin&rsquo;s sandy substrata. Is it possible for the marshy, sandy ground to support such a building? Now look behind you, to the south, and you are looking at the spot where the triumphal arch was due to soar to the heavens as a memorial to the fallen soldiers of the First World War.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With typical Prussian thoroughness, engineers examine the impression made by the 12,650-tonne concrete block and take measurements in the soil. They find it has sunk by 19.4 centimetres, more than expected. But the engineers don&rsquo;t give up hope. They believe the triumphal arch can still be built if they stabilise the soil. Fortunately, it never comes to that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During opening hours, you can also look around the inside of the structure. Below ground, the building is 18 metres deep and there are places where you can look all the way down.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Germania needs space </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Heavy Load-Bearing Body is, quite literally, a concrete reminder of the planning carried out by the General Building Inspector. But traces of these plans can be found in other parts of the city. The one thing Speer needs for his massive buildings is space, and lots of it. The Victory Column stands in the way of his plans to build the world&rsquo;s largest domed building, the Hall of the People. So he has the column moved from its spot in front of the Reichstag building to the centre of the Great Star road intersection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Speer is even more radical when it comes to residential buildings. Tens of thousands of them will need to be demolished. But what about the people who lose their homes? Some of them can be accommodated in new settlements on the outskirts of the city. The Jewish population is also affected by the Nazis&rsquo; plans, but they are simply forced to leave without legal justification or compensation for the loss of their homes. At least Speer&rsquo;s monstrous architectural vision never becomes reality.</p>\r\n",

The massive <em>Hindenburg</em> zeppelin has just turned. Now, white doves of peace flutter across the stadium. A fanfare rings out. A symphony orchestra accompanied by a choir over 3000 strong launches into the <em>Olympic Hymn</em>, composed and conducted by Richard Strauss.

Back then, people call this the &ldquo;F&uuml;hrer Tower&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1933, soon after the Nazi regime seizes power, they start planning for the Olympic Games. Their new Olympic complex &ndash; the Reichssportfeld &ndash; is to be unparalleled. The Nazi regime builds the largest stadium complex in Olympic history.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially, Hitler is sceptical. The Olympic ideal of international peace contrasts sharply with his belief in the dominance of race and nation. But then he realises the enormous propaganda value of the Games &ndash; a unique chance to show Nazi Germany to the world as a peaceful and tolerant country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A dictator on hold </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Berlin, anti-Semitic slogans and posters are removed. The bans in force on the Jewish population are relaxed. Taverns and dance bars could again enjoy some of their old freedoms. Guests could dance into the small hours to jazz and swing &ndash; previously condemned by the Nazis as &ldquo;nigger music&rdquo;. Now the city seems chic and cosmopolitan. Functionaries describe the Olympic Games as an &ldquo;oasis of freedom&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But if so, this is an oasis with nothing for Jewish athletes. The world of sports and athletics has long been coordinated with Nazi policies. Nowhere does anti-Semitism become more quickly accepted than in sport: as early as March 1933, many sports clubs and associations are already expelling Jewish members. In 1936, multiple high jump title winner Gretel Bergmann is dropped from the German Olympic squad at the last moment. In contrast, top fencer Helene Mayer is kept in &ndash; as a &ldquo;token Jew&rdquo;. Behind the scenes, the political terror continues. In the rows of the SA &ldquo;Brownshirts&rdquo;, they sing: &ldquo;Once the Olympics are through, we&rsquo;ll beat up the Jew!&rdquo;. <sup>2 </sup>While the Olympic Games are on, the Nazi regime also sets up the Sachsenhausen concentration camp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Olympic Grounds 1909&ndash;1936&ndash;2006</em>, an exhibition by the German Historical Museum (DHM) on the ground floor of the Glockenturm, shows how sport was increasingly instrumentalised to prepare for war.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Olympic Games only last two weeks. Perfectly staged and organised, the Berlin Olympic Games today are synonymous with a dictatorship&rsquo;s power of persuasion. For the concluding ceremony, anti-aircraft spotlights are projected into the sky to create a hundred-metre-high dome of light designed by Albert Speer &ndash; and the crowds&rsquo; shouts of Heil Hitler echo around the stadium. There would be no more token gestures to international understanding and the country&rsquo;s global standing.</p>\r\n",

Niem&ouml;ller&rsquo;s family are waiting for him outside the prison gates, but the Gestapo smuggle him out of the back and take him to Sachsenhausen concentration camp.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Martin Niem&ouml;ller becomes a &ldquo;personal prisoner of the F&uuml;hrer&rdquo;. But he&rsquo;s better off than most of the other prisoners. Joseph Goebbels says: &ldquo;Niem&ouml;ller should eat well and get fat so no-one can continue to call him a martyr. But he is not to be let loose on mankind.&rdquo; <sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thousands of protest letters are sent to the Chancellery, but the Nazis won&#39;t let him go. In 1941 Niem&ouml;ller is transferred to Dachau, where he is liberated by American soldiers shortly before the end of the war.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Martin Niem&ouml;ller has become a pacifist. He criticises the establishment of the Federal Republic of Germany and opposes rearmament. In the USA, school children learn the now famous words of Pastor Niem&ouml;ller: &ldquo;First the Nazis came for the Communists and I did not speak out, because I wasn&rsquo;t a Communist. Then they locked up the Social Democrats and I did not speak out, because I wasn&rsquo;t a Social Democrat. Then they came for the trade unionists and I did not speak out, because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for me &ndash; and there was no one left to speak for me.&rdquo; <sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are standing in front of Martin Niem&ouml;ller&#39;s parsonage in Dahlem. It hardly changed since it was built in 1910. It reopened in June 2018 after renovations. In the 1980s it was turned into a centre for peace and education.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the historic building is a place of learning and a memorial to the Protestants who resisted the Nazis. Along with St Anne&#39;s Church, the churchyard and the parish hall, the parsonage is a tangible reminder of dark days in German history.</p>\r\n",

Window panes shatter, chandeliers lie on the floor in smithereens. It&#39;s the night of November 9th. Jewish places of worship are being set alight all over Berlin, and the New Synagogue is no exception. Germany&rsquo;s largest synagogue is in flames, but the head of the local police is not prepared to stand by while the brownshirts burn it to the ground. He draws his pistol.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>The New Synagogue is the embodiment of Jewish life in Berlin. With its gleaming golden dome, its Moorish architecture is reminiscent the Thousand And One Nights. It is destined to be one of the Nazis&rsquo; main targets on the night of 9 November 1938.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ordnung muss sein &ndash; Order must prevail! </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wilhelm Kr&uuml;tzfeld, the head of the local police precinct, confronts the brownshirts. In one hand he clutches his pistol. In the other he holds an even more powerful weapon &ndash; a document from the imperial era showing that the monument is a protected historical landmark. Kr&uuml;tzfeld calls the fire brigade and ensures they can access the building. He throws out the rioters and arsonists, and the SA mob is forced to disperse. On this night of terror that is later dubbed <em>Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass)</em>, the New Synagogue is one of the few synagogues in the whole of Germany to sustain only minimal damage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The brownshirts didn&rsquo;t reckon with someone like Kr&uuml;tzfeld. On that fateful night, he is one of the few people who is prepared to stand up to them. The police officer is determined to maintain public order. As a Prussian official, he is conscientious with a sense of justice. But this means he is at odds with his nation&rsquo;s Nazi rulers. The next day, Berlin&rsquo;s police commissioner calls Kr&uuml;tzfeld into his office, but allows him to return to work with a verbal reprimand.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Correctness becomes courage </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not the only time that Kr&uuml;tzfeld and his colleagues take a moral stand. Kr&uuml;tzfeld stamps forged identity cards and warns Jewish residents in his neighbourhood when raids are imminent. The police lieutenant retires in 1943 and returns to his native Schleswig-Holstein.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He is memorialised in Heinz Knobloch Kr&uuml;tzfeld&rsquo;s book <em>Der beherzte Reviervorsteher (The Valiant Precinct Chief)</em>. To the right of the synagogue entrance you can see a plaque commemorating Wilhelm Kr&uuml;tzfeld. It was donated by the Berlin police.</p>\r\n",

The Sachsenhausen concentration camp epitomises the National Socialists&rsquo; systematic persecution and oppression. They imprisoned their opponents here under the most inhumane conditions.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p><strong>Sachsenhausen concentration camp&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The order from the head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler, is to build a &ldquo;totally modern, up-to-date, easily expandable&rdquo; camp. The project is assigned to architect Bernhard Kuiper. He draws up a plan for the complex, which is laid out like an equilateral triangle. It incorporates the prisoners&#39; huts, the commandant&#39;s office and barracks for the SS guards. The design is predicated on a &ldquo;geometry of total terror&rdquo;. From watchtower A, a single machine gun has a clear line of fire over all 68 of the prison barracks grouped in four rings around the semicircular roll call area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The camp is separated from the outside world by 3-metre-high walls and an electrified barbed wire fence. Nine watchtowers, mounted guards and vicious guard dogs stifle any hope of escape for the prisoners. The Nazis have chosen to build their chamber of horrors in the forest north of Berlin. From 1938 onwards, the camp also acts as the administrative centre for all other concentration camps in Germany.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As they enter the camp through the main wrought-iron gate, prisoners are taunted by the inscription &ldquo;Arbeit macht frei&rdquo; (&ldquo;Work sets you free&rdquo;). The SS commandant lives in Tower A. The tower&rsquo;s architecture symbolises the power of the SS, built solely on violence and cruelty. Every day, the prisoners spend up to 16 hours doing hard physical labour, building roads, working in local factories or in the forest. Death is an everyday occurrence. Inmates die from exhaustion, typhoid or dysentery. Day after day, prisoners are interrogated, tortured, shot or beaten to death.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Martyrdom is a part of everyday life </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Martyrdom is a part of the prisoners&rsquo; everyday lives. Thousands are crammed into 68 huts. Sometimes as many as 500 inmates are squeezed into a single hut. The day is organised along military lines. The lights come on at 4.15am sharp and the prisoners assemble for roll call. Their lives are dominated by back-breaking work. Anyone who doesn&rsquo;t toe the line or breaks the most minor of camp rules faces brutal punishment, such as being whipped on their naked buttocks. The force of the blows breaks the backs of some prisoners, exposes their kidneys or crushes their testicles.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first, the Nazis mainly send their political opponents to Sachsenhausen. Hitler&rsquo;s would-be assassin Georg Elser is held here until he is moved on to Dachau. Other prominent inmates include the Protestant pastor of the Confessing Church, Martin Niem&ouml;ller, actor Erwin Geschonneck, publisher Peter Suhrkamp, and SPD politician Rudolf Breitscheid. The National Socialists also do not tolerate homosexuals or &ldquo;the workshy&rdquo; in their &quot;people&rsquo;s community&quot;. With the outbreak of World War II, they start bringing people to the camp from all over the occupied territories. After 1941 thousands of Soviet prisoners of war are executed by shooting.</p>\r\n",

This camp complex is the only one in Berlin to have been preserved largely intact.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In plain sight</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1943, forced labourers are a common sight. Up to 11 million people are being forced to work in Germany and its occupied territories. Many of them are in Berlin. The camp in Sch&ouml;neweide, one of around 3,000 such camps in Berlin, is located in the middle of a residential area. Local residents can look over at the camp while they eat their Sunday breakfast.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first of over 2,000 forced labourers arrives in Sch&ouml;neweide in mid-1944. They work on building sites, in munitions factories, for the German Railway, or they&rsquo;re put to work building anti-aircraft installations or clearing rubble. Without forced labour, the German economy would collapse. The camp in Sch&ouml;neweide quickly fills up, mainly with deported civilians from Western and Eastern Europe and female prisoners from a satellite of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. There are also a few Italian soldiers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cigarettes can save lives</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Italians arrive in Sch&ouml;neweide at the end of November 1944. Until recently they were military allies. But when Italy switches sides, they become enemies whose labour is to be exploited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ugo Brilli is one of them. On 18 November 1944, he is issued with a housing card. He will live in building 3, room 7 until the end of the war. At first Brilli works for Siemens, clearing rubble. The job is physically exhausting, and he gets thinner by the day. Then he uses cigarettes to buy himself a kitchen job in the camp. It proves to be his salvation &ndash; his weight has dropped to 48 kilos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A life in limbo</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from going to work, the forced labourers rarely leave the camp. They are not forbidden to leave, but they are not allowed to take any part in public life. So they can&rsquo;t go to the cinema or play sport. Public transport is off limits. This restricted freedom of movement means that many inmates are killed in air raids because they are not allowed to use public air raid shelters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brilli survives. On 23 April 1945, the Red Army liberates the forced labour camp. He has a long journey home, arriving in northern Italy in September 1945. Decades later he recounts his experiences of daily life in the camp. You&rsquo;ll hear his story as part of the audio guide that accompanies your tour of the camp.</p>\r\n",

A small crowd of women are waiting outside, huddling together to keep warm. To begin with, there is only silence. Then the women start shouting &ndash; &ldquo;Give us back our men!&rdquo; The shouts grow ever louder: &ldquo;We want our men back!&rdquo; Demonstrating without permission is strictly forbidden, but the women remain there waiting.

"mainText": "<p><strong>The Factory Action&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In early 1943, the Nazi authorities launch a large-scale campaign to round up the remaining German Jews and deport them to Auschwitz. The Gestapo and SS close in to haul the men off. In Berlin, they arrest around 8000 Jews at their places of work, taking them directly to a series of designated assembly points. Later, those arrested call this raid the &ldquo;factory action&rdquo;. Under the Nazi regime&rsquo;s racial laws, 2000 of those arrested are spouses in &ldquo;mixed marriages&rdquo; &ndash; largely Jewish men married to non-Jewish women. The Gestapo herd the men into the Jewish community building in Rosenstra&szlig;e. Family members desperately try to contact their loved ones locked inside. The building hardly has any toilet facilities and no places to wash. The stench in the rooms sticks in the throat. In the corridors and rooms, the men can only sit, stand and sleep in turns.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are at an advertising pillar in front of the building at Rosenstra&szlig;e Nr. 2&ndash;4. This kind of advertising pillar was also here in 1943. A small girl stands in front of it, looking anxiously upwards. In the bitter cold, her tears freeze as they trickled down her face. There is a man at the window of the third floor - her father Abraham Pisarek, a photographer. He waves to her. He&rsquo;s received the sandwiches that Ruth and her mother manage to give to a guard. Inside the pack of sandwiches, they have hidden a slip of paper with a loving message.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A courage born of desperation </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Several days go by, and the women are still standing in front of the building in Rosenstra&szlig;e &ndash; and so is the girl. They refuse to move, even when the Gestapo threaten them with guns. After six days, the first men are released. Ruth Pisarek throws her arms around her father. He is thin, unshaved and looks exhausted &ndash; but he has an official notice of release.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does the women&rsquo;s protest in Rosenstra&szlig;e lead the Gestapo to release the men? Historians still dispute the demonstration&rsquo;s effect &ndash; but no one disputes the women&rsquo;s courage at this difficult time. They risked their lives to save their men. This was the only public demonstration against the deportation of German Jews in wartime Nazi Germany.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The building used to incarcerate the men is destroyed in the war. Today, the site is a small greened space.

They are ordered to report here, often first gathered at a collection point in the city. Then they are marched in columns to Grunewald station, led across Berlin, visible to all local residents. The aim is to make Berlin &ldquo;Judenfrei&rdquo; - &ldquo;free of Jews&rdquo;. The Nazis rob the Jewish population of their dignity and freedom, and their lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The transports for the east usually leave the station weekly, sometimes daily, destined for the ghettos in Lodz, Minsk, Riga and Warsaw. For many deported on these trains, journey&rsquo;s end means a mass execution. From late 1942, the trains only go to the Theresienstadt concentration camp or to Auschwitz. From platform 17 alone, thirty-five trains deliver around 17,000 Jews to the gas chambers of Auschwitz.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The death business </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the Deutsche Reichsbahn railway, deportation trains are a business. Rates are charged per kilometre for the people crammed into the wagons: 4 pfennigs for an adult, and 2 pfennigs for a child. Deportations of over 400 people qualify for a group discount. The Jewish communities have to pay for deportation to the ghettos and death camps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you now go onto the platform and walk up and down, you&rsquo;ll see 186 cast iron plates set either side of Gleis 17. They list the dates of the transports in chronological order, and the number of Jews deported. Today, weeds and small trees are growing in the gravel bed of the track. Birds are singing. Nature is reclaiming this platform to hell.</p>\r\n",

"<p>The events on 19 April 1943, the day of the deportation shortly before Hitler&rsquo;s birthday, are portrayed in a feature film. It was produced by Artur Brauner, himself a Holocaust survivor. <em>The Last Train</em> from 2006 tells a dramatically moving story. The film is carried by brilliant actors, including Sibel Kekilli and Gedeon Burkhard. But the images can only tell part of the story of the inhuman cruelty people experienced at this location.</p>\n"

He walks rapidly towards the M&uuml;llerstra&szlig;e boulevard. Unobtrusively, he enters M&uuml;llerstra&szlig;e 174. He puts a hand-written postcard in the lobby, and quickly leaves. Together with wife Elise, Otto Hampel writes postcards against the Nazi regime.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p><strong>The path to resistance </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the National Socialists&rsquo; seizure of power, Otto and Elise Hampel are just like almost all other working-class couples. They simply adapt to the new conditions. But in 1940, Elise&rsquo;s brother is killed in the war. His death prompts the couple to turn their back on the regime &ndash; and to act. From 1940 to 1942, driven by this personal tragedy, they write around 200 postcards and leaflets. These are a general call to stop supporting the Nazi regime&rsquo;s criminal war, and to overthrow the dictator Adolf Hitler: &ldquo;Down with Hitler&rsquo;s gang responsible for the war!&rdquo; <sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Postcards for freedom </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Otto and Elise Hampel only attended elementary school for a few years. Their texts may reflect their simple background, but their feisty messages do not mince words: &ldquo;Hitlerism destroys the basis of all human rights!&rdquo; <sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hampels are taking an enormous risk. The Nazi regime has draconian punishments even for just listening to foreign radio broadcasts. Most people finding the Hampels&rsquo; postcards hand them directly to the police, either from fear &ndash; or obedience. The investigations are launched straight away.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Gestapo&rsquo;s Department IV, Detective Sergeant Willy P&uuml;schel sticks flags into a Berlin map on the wall, marking where the postcards and leaflets are found. Most of the flags are in the Wedding district, though some are in Charlottenburg, Sch&ouml;neberg and Kreuzberg. Despite the many clues, the Hampels repeatedly slip through the Gestapo&rsquo;s fingers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, in October 1942, after two years of investigations, the police arrest them. A woman saw the couple laying out postcards on Nollendorfplatz square and reports them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just a few months later, the People&rsquo;s Court sentences Elise and Otto Hampel to death for &ldquo;subversion of the war effort&rdquo; und &ldquo;preparing for high treason&rdquo;. Faced with the death sentence, they start blaming each other. On 8 April 1943, Elise and Otto Hampel are executed separately in the Berlin-Pl&ouml;tzensee prison.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>Karlshorst, a district in the south-east of Berlin, is well away from the bustling inner city. Here, social housing estates from the 1920s and 1930s rub shoulders with elaborate mansions and apartment blocks from the early years of Imperial Germany. This is the kind of solidly respectable district where no momentous events disturb the passage of time. And yet Karlshorst made a big splash in world history. You are now standing outside the former Wehrmacht officers&rsquo; mess. Here, at the end of the Second World War, the High Command of the German armed forces meet General Zhukov, commander-in-chief of the Soviet army that took Berlin.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>8 May 1945. Hitler is dead. The Soviet flag is flying over the Reichstag. Nazi Germany has been driven from the stage of world history for good. The country has unconditionally surrendered. But Germany&rsquo;s official capitulation still needs the signature of the commander-in-chief of the Wehrmacht &ndash; the German armed forces.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And where should this highly symbolic act take place? The Soviet forces look for a central location in Berlin, Hitler&rsquo;s planned world capital. But the city is in ruins, and so are most official buildings. Finally, they find a former officers&rsquo; mess in Karlshorst in the city suburbs &ndash; not the central location they wanted, but the building is still intact. Here on the evening of 8 May, representatives of the victorious Red Army meet the defeated generals of the German Wehrmacht.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Just a few hours before... </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Colonel General Alfred Jodl, Wehrmacht Chief of Operations Staff, is hundreds of kilometres away in the French city of Reims. At 2.41 am in the early hours of 7 May 1945, Jodl signs the unconditional surrender of all German armed forces. Not without a little pathos, he expresses the hope that the &ldquo;victor will treat them with generosity&rdquo;. &ldquo;The German people and armed forces,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;are now, for better or worse, delivered into the victor&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Soviet leadership feels robbed of its moment of glory. It insists on ratifying the capitulation already signed in Reims. And so Karlshorst in the south-east of Berlin has its moment of fame. On 9 May at around quarter past midnight central European summer time, the cameras click and cine cameras whir to capture world history in the making. In Berlin&rsquo;s Karlshorst district.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The signature ending the war in Europe </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shortly before midnight. General Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, then the highest ranking active soldier in the Wehrmacht, enters the packed room. Representatives of all four victorious Allies are present. Film cameras are on hand to capture the moment. General Field Marshal Keitel looks briefly at General Zhukov, Soviet commander-in-chief, and hesitates, as if he expects Zhukov to stand up. Zhukov remains seated. Keitel raises his Field Marshal&rsquo;s staff to acknowledge him, and sits down. After just a few moments, Keitel signs the ratified terms of unconditional surrender. Later, Zhukov recalled the moments after the ceremony: &ldquo;Everyone was congratulating one other and shaking hands. Many had tears of joy in their eyes.&rdquo; <sup>2 </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The world heaved a sigh of relief. The Second World War in Europe is finally over.&nbsp; This historical location has been a museum since 1967. Every year in the socialist GDR, the divided section of eastern Germany, the Day of Liberation by the Red Army was celebrated in the &ldquo;Museum of the Unconditional Surrender of Fascist Germany in the Great Patriotic War&rdquo;.</p>\r\n",

The headlights of a flatbed truck illuminate a pile of sand. Volleys of gunfire ring out, one after another. Their targets are General Friedrich Olbricht, Colonel Albrecht Mertz von Quirnheim, Lieutenant Werner von Haeften &ndash; and Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg.

The Imperial Navy moved in in 1911, followed by the Ministry of the Reichswehr and the army command of the Weimar Republic. During the Third Reich, the high command of the army and reserve army were based in the massive building. And it is here that General Friedrich Olbricht and his co-conspirators draw up plans for the coup &ndash; codename Operation Valkyrie.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The plan is for Stauffenberg to assassinate the dictator Adolf Hitler by bombing his Wolf&rsquo;s Lair headquarters on 20 July 1944. The unjust and brutal war has placed many officers in a moral dilemma. The conservative elites reject National Socialism, the barbaric war and the murder of European Jews. They conclude the war has been lost. They join forces with other resistance groups to plan the assassination. But the attack fails. Hitler survives &ndash; and takes revenge on the conspirators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Chained, but with heads held high </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The east wing of the building borders Stauffenbergstra&szlig;e. When you enter the courtyard from here, you see two long metal plinths of different heights in the centre of the yard. This is the exact spot where the sand was piled up on the night of the executions on 20 July 1944. The four men were made to line up here one by one. At the far end of the courtyard you can see several lime trees growing up towards the light. In front of them stands a statue called Young Man with Bound Hands. His slim figure exudes calm determination. He seems to be taking a step forward, head held high, towards his &ldquo;final journey&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Memorial Centre </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Memorial Centre commemorates different facets of the resistance against the National Socialist dictatorship and includes biographical information, political motives and the struggles of the various resistance groups. Alongside Stauffenberg, the exhibition commemorates everyone who opposed Hitler. The Memorial Centre is one of the main memorials to the revolt of conscience against the criminal regime of the National Socialists.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also remembers the struggles of the White Rose resistance movement, the communist and church resistance groups and the Edelweiss Pirates against the dictatorship of the National Socialists. Another Memorial commemorates the <em>Silent Heroes</em> &ndash; people who risked their lives to help persecuted Jews during the Nazi dictatorship.</p>\r\n",

The day before, air raids severely damaged parts of the prison. To prevent the prisoners from escaping, the regime decides to execute all those who have been sentenced to death. A black curtain divides the narrow execution room in two. The guillotine has been damaged by the bombing, so the executor&rsquo;s assistants hang the prisoners from wire loops attached to the eight hooks. Death is slow in coming. In this room, Hitler&#39;s murderers execute more than 250 people.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The victims</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The victims all have one thing in common: they defied the inhuman regime of the National Socialists. They are antifascists. They resisted in the hope of gaining freedom and fought to the bitter end to liberate Europe from fascism. They include communists and members of the Rote Kapelle, the Red Orchestra. But also Christians who resisted Hitler as members of the Kreisau Circle, and officers involved in the failed coup of 20 July 1944.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The execution site where we are now standing is in the grounds of Pl&ouml;tzensee prison. The construction of the prison in the grounds of the Pl&ouml;tzensee estate in the Tegel Forest began in 1868. After 1933 it was increasingly used as a central execution site for political prisoners.

"introtext": "<p>27 February 1943, Rosenthaler Stra&szlig;e 39. Gestapo trucks are parked in front of a workshop for brushes and brooms. The Jewish workers, most blind and deaf, climb into the trucks and are whisked away. Otto Weidt, the owner of a small factory workshop, is furious. Shortly afterwards, he is ready to leave. His destination &ndash; the Gestapo&rsquo;s Department of Jewish Affairs.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>The afternoon of the same day, passers-by see a very odd spectacle. Around 50 men and women are walking down Rosenthaler Stra&szlig;e towards the workshop for brooms and brushes. The group is led by Otto Weidt. Just like the others, he is almost blind. Later, writer Inge Deutschkron recalls, &ldquo;It was like a scene from an ancient tragedy.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup> She also works for Otto Weidt. Just as he has several times before, he manages to convince the Gestapo of how vital his workers are for the war effort.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Freedom for a time </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brushes and brooms can save lives. At the start of the war, they are declared essential to the war effort. <sup>2 </sup>The Wehrmacht, the German army, is one of the largest clients of Otto Weidt&rsquo;s little broom factory. For a long time, he can protect his blind workers, many of them Jews, from Nazi persecution. He brings many of his workers here from factories with brutal and inhumane conditions. In his workshop, they can demonstrate their skills &ndash; and survive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On an old photograph, Otto Weidt is sitting surrounded by his employees. They call him &ldquo;Papa Weidt&ldquo;. <sup>3 </sup>Otto Weidt is a pacifist. He loathes the Nazis &ndash; and wants to help the people they persecute.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During Hitler&rsquo;s dictatorship, more than 1700 Jews survive underground in Berlin &ndash; thanks to helpers such as Otto Weidt. These helpers become known as &ldquo;Silent Heroes&rdquo;. Today, Otto Weidt is also honoured in Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The survivors hidden in Berlin include later journalist and author Inge Deutschkron. Down the years, apart from her work as a writer, Inge Deutschkron gives many talks in schools to keep alive the awareness of the persecution and murder of the European Jews. In the late 1990s, when a group of students discover the empty rooms of Otto Weidt&rsquo;s old workshop by chance, Inge Deutschkron immediately wants to help. With her support, an exhibition is held in these historic rooms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A cupboard as a refuge </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you come into the exhibition, the floorboards creak at every step. The workshop is one small room after another. The last room seems to end with a cupboard against the wall. But carry on! Behind the cupboard door built on at the front, there&rsquo;s a secret doorway to another room. Without windows in the room, the atmosphere is oppressive. For many months, this is where Otto Weidt hides all four members of the Horn family. At that time, a cupboard with a double door stands in front of the little box room. It is a safe hiding place &ndash; until an informer betrays him to the Gestapo. In October 1943, the Horn family is arrested during a raid on the workshop. A little later, they are murdered in Auschwitz. This time, they are beyond Otto Weidt&rsquo;s help.</p>\r\n",

After the Reichstag building burns down on 27 February, the German parliament is moved just a few hundred metres to this former theatre and opera house. Swastika flags hang from the ceiling, the sound of marching boots resounds through the hall. The inaugural meeting of the newly elected German parliament is about to start.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>In this meeting, the Reichstag members strip themselves of their powers. Some have already fled the Nazis, others are arrested. The governing coalition of Hitler&rsquo;s National Socialists and the German National People&rsquo;s Party, the Centre Party, Bavarian People&rsquo;s Party and the German State Party all vote for the Enabling Act. This act, officially entitled &ldquo;Law to Remedy the Distress of People and Reich&rdquo;, <sup>1 </sup>suspends the democratic constitution of 1920s Germany. It grants Hitler and his government extensive power and is the basis for all the Nazi regime&rsquo;s legislation. <sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The last free speech in the Reichstag parliament </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shortly before 6 pm, Otto Wels, leader of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), stands up to speak. &ldquo;You can take our lives and freedom, but you cannot take our honour.&rdquo; <sup>3 </sup>It is the last free speech in the Reichstag. His words are applauded by the few SPD representatives in the hall. In this difficult hour, they fight for their democratic convictions. From the rows of the Nazi party delegates, the only sound is derisive laughter. The SPD is the only party that refuses to vote for the Enabling Act. The Communists would also have voted against Hitler, but many are already arrested. They have been stripped of their seats in parliament &ldquo;by decree&rdquo;. <sup>4 </sup>Almost immediately after the Enabling Act is passed, the SPD is banned.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After his courageous speech, Otto Wels flees to France. The Enabling Act marks the end of a democratic constitution under the rule of law. For many elected representatives of the democratic parties, especially in the SPD and the Communist party, it ushers in long years of suffering through persecution and suppression under the Nazi regime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Democrats against Hitler </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the Second World War enters its final phase, the Nazi regime wants to settle old scores with all its opponents on the German political scene. There is a new wave of arrests. This time only a few survive imprisonment. Most of the former parliamentarians die in the Sachsenhausen and Buchenwald concentration camps.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rudolf Breitscheid is one of the most prominent SPD politicians also incarcerated in these camps. His supporters applauded him for his speeches and policy of reconciliation with France &ndash; exactly why the Nazis hate him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March 1933, Breitscheid emigrates to France. On 10 May 1940, the German forces invade. The Gestapo arrest Rudolf Breitscheid in February 1941, deporting him and his wife to the Sachsenhausen and Buchenwald concentration camps. In August 1944, Rudolf Breitscheid dies during an American air raid. Today, many are unaware of his fate, but his name is still well known, commemorated in the name of the Breitscheidplatz square next to the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, when you approach the visitors&rsquo; entrance of the Reichstag building from Tiergarten Park, you&rsquo;ll notice 96 cast iron plates set in the pavement. The plates, rather reminiscent of gravestones, bear the names and dates of 9 women and 87 men, together with the name of their political party. This memorial, inaugurated in 1992, commemorates the murdered members of the Reichstag.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>30 January 1933. Goebbels is in celebratory mood: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done it. We&rsquo;re in Wilhelmstra&szlig;e. Hitler is Reich Chancellor. It&rsquo;s like a fairy tale&rdquo;. <sup>1 </sup>The NSDAP leaders are waiting for Adolf Hitler in the Kaiserhof Hotel. Outside, Wilhelmplatz is buzzing. Supporters, onlookers and journalists all wave, shout and surge forward when Hitler finally appears around noon. For months he has been living and working in this hotel in the government district. But this afternoon he&rsquo;s due to move across the street &ndash; into the Reich Chancellery.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>&ldquo;What does Wilhelmstra&szlig;e say?&rdquo; This is the question European diplomats have been asking since the middle of the 19th century. Wilhelmstra&szlig;e has been synonymous with political power since Bismarck, like Downing Street in London or the Quai d&#39;Orsay in Paris. Wilhelmstra&szlig;e has been the site of the official residence of the German head of state, the Reich President, since 1919. Now the National Socialists are taking over the Weimar Republic ministries that they so detest. But they don&rsquo;t only want to occupy these historic buildings. The new government is also planning to construct buildings that will reflect its grip on power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>From democracy to dictatorship &ndash; the Wilhelmstra&szlig;e History Mile </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new Reich Chancellery, the Ministry of Propaganda, the Ministry of Aviation &ndash; three monumental government buildings are built on Wilhelmstra&szlig;e over the next few years. Wilhelmstra&szlig;e is now a corridor of power wrapped in red swastika flags. It is like a huge political stage, hosting regular mass rallies and parades. Most days, a crowd of onlookers gathers in the hope of catching a glimpse of Adolf Hitler. They shout up to the balcony of the Reich Chancellery: &ldquo;Dear F&uuml;hrer, please show yourself at the window!&rdquo;. <sup>2&nbsp;</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Little is left </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ministry of Propaganda and the Ministry of Aviation are the only National Socialist government buildings built after 1933 to survive the war. Most of the older buildings, the palaces and ministerial buildings of the government quarter are destroyed by Allied air raids during the Second World War, by street battles when it ends, and by demolition in the post-war period.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Wilhelmstra&szlig;e History Mile open-air exhibition has 32 information boards providing details about the street&rsquo;s most important buildings. If you stand in Wilhelmplatz, you are approximately half way along the 2,400-metre-long History Mile. From here you really can see how dramatically the street has changed. You will no longer find a square surrounded by buildings. The Topography of Terror exhibition on Wilhelmstra&szlig;e is close by. A model of the city explains how the apparatuses of power and terror were closely entwined under the Nazi regime.</p>\r\n",

On 6 March 1942, he is meeting representatives of various state bodies to discuss the forced sterilisation of &ldquo;half-Jews&rdquo;.<em> </em>In this building, the Office of Jewish Affairs, civil servants are organising and coordinating the murder of Jews throughout Europe.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>Every five minutes, a number 100 bus drives past 115/116 Kurf&uuml;rstenstra&szlig;e. Bus route 100 is known as the tourist route because it goes past many of Berlin&rsquo;s main sights. But passengers rarely get off at Schillstra&szlig;e because the attraction is actually the bus stop itself. It&rsquo;s the only bus stop memorial in Berlin. Information boards and photos tell people about the building that stood behind today&rsquo;s bus stop around 1940.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A hotel was built on the site in the 1960s. The original building was built in 1910 to house a Jewish charity. This acted as a community centre where Jewish people could seek advice on everyday problems and attend plays and concerts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>First take their freedom, then take their life </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Nazis confiscate the building in 1939. In 1940 a Gestapo department, the Office of Jewish Affairs, moves into the building on Kurf&uuml;rstenstra&szlig;e. It soon becomes known as &ldquo;Eichmann&rsquo;s office&rdquo; after the department&rsquo;s head, Adolf Eichmann.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is where the Nazis organise the deportation of the Jews. It also issues specific directives affecting Jewish citizens who are still in Germany. The Office of Jewish Affairs orders Jews to wear the Star of David, prohibits them from using public transport and demands that they hand over their bicycles and cameras. Each directive chips away at their lives, removing another piece of their freedom.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By March 1941, the Office of Jewish Affairs has new objectives. Now Eichmann&#39;s office is responsible for organising the annihilation of Europe&rsquo;s Jews. By the end of the war, six million people have been murdered in Nazi concentration and extermination camps.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adolf Eichmann&rsquo;s department is involved in every aspect. His staff coordinate the transportation of Europe&rsquo;s Jews to the labour and extermination camps. It is this department that ensures one of the greatest crimes in history runs like clockwork.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eichmann&rsquo;s office organises these deportations to the camps until the spring of 1945. After the war Eichmann flees to Argentina. The Israeli secret service track him down in 1950 thanks to the investigative work of Fritz Bauer, the Hesse district attorney. The key organiser of the Holocaust is sentenced to death in Jerusalem.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The building in Kurf&uuml;rstenstra&szlig;e survives the war almost intact but is demolished in the 1960s to make way for the hotel that stands here today.</p>\r\n",

But justice and freedom are not on the agenda today in the plenary hall of the Court of Appeal at Kleistpark. The People&rsquo;s Court meets here on 21 August 1944. The accused are said to be conspirators in an attempt to assassinate Hitler on 20 July. Roland Freisler, President of the People&rsquo;s Court, raises his arm in a Nazi salute. Ulrich Wilhelm Count Schwerin von Schwanenfeld, one of the accused, is led into the room. The trial begins.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p><strong>The Volksgerichtshof (People&rsquo;s Court) </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1934, the Nazi regime establishes a &ldquo;People&rsquo;s Court&rdquo; to &ldquo;combat the enemies of the state&rdquo;. <sup>1 </sup>The court is set up in the wake of the Reichstag fire trial in late 1933. There, the presiding judge in the Reichtsgericht, the highest German court, acquits four of the five accused. Hitler is furious, and decrees that future cases of treason can only be heard by the People&rsquo;s Court &ndash; a new political court. At first, the court is housed in the Prussian state parliament building. In 1935, it moves to a former school building at Potsdamer Platz. But in July 1944, Roland Freisler, President of the People&rsquo;s Court, asks for a prestigious building as a showplace for the trials of those involved in the plot against Hitler&rsquo;s life. The building at Kleistpark housing the Court of Appeal dates from the Wilhelmine period. The entrance is daunting, a symbol of authority. The main hall is resplendent and large.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hitler has no doubts about Roland Freisler, who is well-known as a &ldquo;hanging judge&rdquo;. He will &ldquo;...make sure it all goes smoothly.&rdquo; <sup>2 </sup>After all, Hitler&rsquo;s loyal rabble-rouser has been President of the People&rsquo;s Court since 1942, mercilessly passing down the sentences Hitler wants. For the trial against the conspirators in the assassination attempt, the Nazis come up with a special idea &ndash; a camera secretly filming the trial through a small hole in the swastika flag behind Freisler. The film material shows Freisler screaming at the accused, mocking and humiliating them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>For freedom &ndash; with composure and dignity </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Count Schwerin von Schwanenfeld tries to explain the reasons for his actions, Roland Freisler screams at him, &ldquo;You really are a low scoundrel!&rdquo;. <sup>3 </sup>The film material is never released. Goebbels and the Nazi propaganda machine want scenes of the accused breaking down under Freisler&rsquo;s merciless contempt and ridicule. Yet despite Freisler&rsquo;s vitriolic performance, they seek to retain their composure and dignity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The People&rsquo;s Court also sentences Count Schwerin von Schwanenfeld to death. Between 1934 and 1945, the People&rsquo;s Court hands down sentences in 18,000 cases. The court&rsquo;s horrific record includes around 5,000 death sentences. One perversion of justice after another by the Nazis supported by lawyers and judges sympathetic to their cause <sup>4 </sup>creates a regime of open terror.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Freisler dies during an air raid on 3 February 1945. The court house in Bellevuestra&szlig;e is hit, and he is buried under falling masonry. The building is totally destroyed and never rebuilt. Today, the site is marked by a memorial plaque in the ground commemorating the victims of the People&rsquo;s Court.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Court of Appeal at Kleistpark survives the bombing raids. Initially, the Russian army liberating the city uses the building as a pigsty. Soon afterwards, it provides the setting for the constituent meeting of the International Military Tribunal of the Nuremberg trials. It also becomes the seat of the Allied Control Council until 1948. Today, it is once again home to the Berlin Court of Appeal.</p>\r\n",

He is lying on a hard stone floor. His left eye is bloodshot. His shirt clings to the wounds on his skin. The smell of sweat, blood and urine fills the air. It&#39;s 21 March 1933, and we are in one of the first Nazi concentration camps.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p><strong>Imprisoned without trial </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you go down the stairs in the brick building, the cold creeps into your bones. You are in the basement of an abandoned barracks in General-Pape-Stra&szlig;e. During the imperial era, the Railway Regiment was stationed here. During the First World War, this is where new recruits had to report for duty. They left with their uniform and rations in a cardboard box, which is why Berliners dubbed the street General-Pappkarton-Stra&szlig;e: General Cardboard Box Street.&nbsp; When the Nazis sweep to power in 1933, the SA&rsquo;s Field Police move in. They begin arresting the party&rsquo;s political opponents. The basement becomes a prison, and the goon squad is given free rein. Denied legal counsel, the prisoners are at the mercy of the Field Police. They are lashed to within an inch of their lives. They are forced to stand to attention or exercise until they drop. They count themselves lucky if they are given a drop of weak coffee or filthy water to drink. The majority of detainees are opponents of Hitler.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The neurologist Dr Fritz Fraenkel, a communist and a Jew, is a thorn in the Nazis&rsquo; side. He is tortured then released, but only after signing a statement saying he has been well treated. He immediately flees to Switzerland with his family.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rediscovering a torture chamber </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For nine months, the cellar is the scene of unimaginable horrors. At least 30 prisoners die at the hands of the SA Field Police. Then the prison is closed and the cellar is all but forgotten.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A memorial in the cellars on Papestra&szlig;e finally opens in 2013. Look closely at the walls and you will see remnants of its days as a prison. When you step into the corridor you can make out some red letters on the bricks. There is also an imperial eagle carrying a swastika and the abbreviation &ldquo;Fepo&rdquo; for Field Police. This former prison is one of only a handful of historical sites in Berlin that retain traces of the early days of the Nazi terror in 1933.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>14 January 1930. The woman renting the little apartment in Gro&szlig;e Frankfurter Stra&szlig;e 62 has quarrelled with her lodger again. Now, she&rsquo;s off to the corner pub to get reinforcements. The Communists there know who her lodger is &ndash; the &ldquo;Nazi boss of Alexanderplatz&rdquo;. <sup>1 </sup>His real name is Horst Wessel, long a thorn in the side of the Communists. They are only too happy to work him over. When Wessel comes home, a few muscular Communists are waiting with a special greeting. Then, a few shots ring out. Hit by a bullet in the face, Wessel falls to the floor.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p><strong>The propaganda machine creates a martyr </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The nearest hospital in the working-class district of Friedrichshain is not far from the scene of the shooting. Badly injured, Wessel is rushed through the impressive hospital gateway straight to the operating theatre. His life is saved by an emergency operation, but he dies of blood poisoning on 23 February 1930. Joseph Goebbels jots down three words in his diary, &ldquo;A new martyr&rdquo;. <sup>2 </sup>Immediately, he begins to plan how Wessel&rsquo;s death can best serve the Nazi propaganda machine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>From pastor&rsquo;s son to confirmed Nazi&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Horst Wessel is the son of the Lutheran pastor at the traditional St Nicholas Church in Berlin. Even as a young man, Wessel joins groups in nationalist &lsquo;v&ouml;lkisch&rsquo; circles. When he is 19, he becomes a member of the NSDAP &ndash; the Nazi Party. Quickly gaining the reputation of an effective speaker, he is seen as someone capable of whipping up emotions for the party. Only Joseph Goebbels, Gauleiter (district leader) of Berlin, gives more public speeches in the city. On 1 May 1929, Horst Wessel takes over as head of the SA troop in Friedrichshain &ndash; a district well known as a Communist Party stronghold.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With his brown shirts, Wessel enthusiastically implements a policy of street fights and brawls in pubs and taverns. Wessel sets out to be provocative &ndash; and succeeds. His SA troop are always active. They openly march to music through the streets. He also adapts the Communist tradition of workers&rsquo; songs, and has his SA troop play them on shawms, a piercing wind instrument. Wessel even composes new words to an old traditional melody: &ldquo;Raise the flag / The ranks tightly closed / The SA marches calm and steady&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Communists long to teach Wessel a lesson &ndash; and on 14 January 1930, they act. But it remains unclear if the clash with Wessel is just for political reasons, or if there is a private agenda. The Communist newspaper <em>Die Rote Fahne</em> claims Wessel is a pimp, killed in a fight in that milieu. But the German Communist Party (KPD) cannot stop the Nazis turning Horst Wessel into a martyr.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the seizure of power on 30 January 1933, Hitler and the Nazi regime raise their hero cult around Horst Wessel to a state cult. A guard of honour is placed at the scene of his shooting, and his death becomes a vehicle for solemn appeals to the public. Streets, squares and schools are named after him &ndash; and Friedrichshain is officially renamed Horst-Wessel-Stadt. <em>Die Fahne hoch</em> (Raise the Flag), Wessel&rsquo;s battle song from 1929, becomes the &ldquo;second German national anthem&rdquo;. <sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In October 1933, the hospital in Friedrichshain is named the Horst Wessel Hospital. The building is nearly entirely destroyed in the war. The only original parts remaining today are the impressive entrance and several outbuildings. Otherwise, Vivantes Hospital Friedrichshain is now distinguished by its buildings from a more recent past.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>It&rsquo;s summer, and the Wall is being built. But 12-year-old Erwin from Eiskeller, an exclave of West Berlin, has other problems. He&rsquo;s feeling upset because his parents have split up and he&rsquo;s having a hard time at school.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>So he comes up with a bright idea for getting out of Maths and Latin &ndash; he claims the East German police stopped him while he was cycling to school. The only way he can get to Spandau from Eiskeller is to ride 500 metres down a narrow corridor through East German territory. In the 1960s, 20 people live on 3 farms surrounded by barbed wire and the Wall. East German border guards watch over the fields and horses, the scent of freshly cut hay in their nostrils. After all, it would be relatively easy for East German citizens to escape to such a village.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The threatening environment of the Cold War means that Erwin&rsquo;s story brings the Allies onto the scene. Instead of a couple of days off school, he ends up with an escort &ndash; and quite a special one! He is followed to school by a British armoured car manned by five soldiers. To school in the morning, back home in the afternoon &ndash; every single day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cycling home through the GDR&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The division of Germany leads to the creation of several exclaves around Berlin. Villages in West Berlin suddenly find they are islands in GDR territory, and areas of East Germany are set adrift in West Berlin. This has an impact on people&rsquo;s daily lives, such as when West Berliners are harassed by East German border guards on their way home, even though they have the necessary permits. Steinst&uuml;cken is one such exclave. Its 190 inhabitants include Heinrich Lummer, leader of the CDU faction in West Berlin&rsquo;s House of Representatives and later Senator of the Interior. They have no choice but to keep to themselves, as apart from doctors and the fire brigade, only registered inhabitants are allowed to enter Steinst&uuml;cken. <sup>1 </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Four Power Agreement of September 1971 ushers in a change to the status quo. It paves the way for an exchange of territory between the West Berlin Senate and the GDR government. There are advantages for both sides, as the West wants free access to its citizens and territories, while the East wants a clearly defined border that is easy to secure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A schoolyard hero </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The agreement on the settlement of enclaves through territorial exchange enters into force on 3 June 1972 under the Four Powers Agreement. The GDR receives 15.6 hectares of West Berlin, while the West Berliners gain 17.1 hectares of East Germany, including Steinst&uuml;cken and improved access to Eiskeller.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Erwin? He&rsquo;s a schoolyard hero. A photo of Erwin on his bike followed by the soldiers in their armoured car flies around the world and he becomes a symbol of the Berliners&#39; desire for freedom. Even when he confesses that he was trying to play truant, <sup>2 </sup>he still keeps his escort &ndash; and his hero status.</p>\r\n",

In the top right we can read the words Berlin, 1 September 1939. It is addressed to Hitler&#39;s personal physician Karl Brandt and Philipp Bouhler, Chief of the Chancellery of the F&uuml;hrer. In his letter, Hitler authorises the two men to carry out the &ldquo;mercy killing&rdquo; of anyone who is allegedly suffering from an incurable disease. The department charged with carrying out this programme of mass murder is set up at Tiergartenstrasse 4, under the codename T4.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>Karl Ahrendt, a coachman, was one of the victims of the National Socialists&rsquo; euthanasia programme. In 1907, when Germany was still under imperial rule, he was arrested on Alexanderplatz. Ahrendt was wearing a general&#39;s coat and trying to pass himself off as a prince. The doctors said he was confused and a danger to the public. He was admitted to a mental hospital where he lived inside his own head &not;&ndash; and spent his time sketching. Many of his surreal drawings have survived to this day. In 1941 the National Socialists sent Ahrendt to the gas chamber.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Crime of the century </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Euthanasia, from the Greek for &ldquo;good death&rdquo; is not a new idea developed by the Nazis. Long before 1933, doctors and politicians in Europe had discussed the possibility of euthanasia for the terminally ill, people with physical and mental disabilities, and children with hereditary diseases. But for the Nazis, it becomes a guiding principle &ndash; they want to systematically terminate the lives of people who they deem &ldquo;unworthy of life&rdquo; according to their own particular criteria.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The &ldquo;desk murderers&rdquo; in the Tiergarten villa </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Berlin, Tiergartenstra&szlig;e 4. In front of you is a wall of blue glass. You are standing on what used to be the ground floor of one of the most magnificent villas in the Tiergarten. It was destroyed during the Second World War. An information centre and memorial to the victims of the National Socialist &quot;euthanasia&quot; murder programme opened here in 2014. Between 1940 and 1945, some 60 civil servants planned and organised the mass murder of people with mental disabilities. They were mainly people who were &ldquo;just following orders&rdquo;: doctors, administrators, secretaries, tradesmen, photographers, drivers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The office staff in Tiergartenstra&szlig;e send out registration forms to psychiatric institutions and nursing homes. The resident physicians dutifully fill out the forms. They note the patient&rsquo;s condition, the amount of care required, and the work involved. At the bottom of the document there is a black box that has to be left empty. Once the form is returned to Tiergartenstra&szlig;e an assessor decides whether the patient should live or die. A minus in the black box means the patient can go on living. A plus is a death sentence. The office staff organise the final journeys of those who are condemned to death. They draw up transportation lists. Buses carry the patients to one of six killing centres, where they are gassed. No one here on Tiergartenstrasse ever sees any of the victims.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Protests by church institutions lead to the Aktion T4 programme being officially discontinued in August 1941. But the killing continues in secret in sanatoriums and nursing homes. It is estimated that some 300,000 people across Europe are victims of the euthanasia programme.</p>\r\n",

They discuss what to do with the estimated eleven million Jews across Europe, both in countries occupied by the German forces as well as those not yet invaded.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The minutes of the Wannsee Conference leave no doubt about the fate of the Jews. They are to be &ldquo;utilized for work in the East in an expedient manner&rdquo;, primarily for building roads.

The &ldquo;remnant [...] will require suitable treatment; because it will without doubt represent the most [physically] resistant part&rdquo;. <sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The meeting ends after 90 minutes. Later, Adolf Eichmann reported that it was conducted very quietly and with much courtesy, with much friendliness &ndash; nicely and politely. <sup>4 </sup>Eichmann is head of the Department of Jewish Affairs in the Gestapo, and takes the minutes of the meeting. Now, the meeting is over and it&rsquo;s time for the meal and a cigar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The key document&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 15-page minutes of the meeting are on show in the dining room of the villa, today the House of the Wannsee Conference, Memorial and Educational Site. Eichmann&rsquo;s minutes are a key document on the organisation of the genocide of the European Jews &ndash; but one very nearly denied to posterity. Thirty copies of the minutes are prepared, all bearing a stamp reading &ldquo;Secret Reich Matter&rdquo;, the equivalent of &ldquo;Top Secret&rdquo;. Shortly before the end of the war, those responsible decide to destroy these incriminating documents. Just one copy survives &ndash; given to Martin Luther, who represented the Foreign Office at the Wannsee Conference. Luther falls from grace and, from 1943, is interned in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. His documents are confiscated to prepare the case against him &ndash; which is why they survive. Today, the original copy of the minutes is in the Foreign Office archive, in the vaults of the former Reichsbank.</p>\r\n",

Above the lectern, a huge banner is emblazoned with the words, &ldquo;Total War &ndash; the Shortest War&rdquo;. The arena is full to bursting &ndash; so full that thirty minutes before the speeches start, the doors have to be closed. The Nazi Party leaders are all present, along with many other prominent figures. The carefully selected audience includes soldiers home on leave and ordinary Berlin citizens. They are all waiting for Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. He steps forward to the microphone. It is his moment &ndash; a speech that will go down in history. &nbsp;</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p><strong>Total War </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The brutal Battle of Stalingrad has been lost, the mood in Germany is at an all-time low. The general population are suffering from the Allied bombing raids. The belief in the promised &ldquo;final victory&rdquo; is wearing thin. Goebbels plans nothing less than to rekindle enthusiasm for the war with a dramatic and fiery speech. He constantly reworks his text. &ldquo;I plan to give a speech which, in its radicalism, will surpass anything which has gone before.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The old inscription outside on the Sportpalast arena says, &ldquo;To German Sport&rdquo;. After all, it is originally built in 1910 as a sports arena. This is where local crowds thrill to the legendary six-day cycle races, the boxing matches, and the action on the world&rsquo;s largest artificial ice rink. But even in the 1920s, the arena is also used for political meetings. Early on, Goebbels sees the arena&rsquo;s potential for propaganda rallies and dubs it &ldquo;our stage&rdquo;. <sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, the Sportpalast is buzzing. When Goebbels&rsquo;s calls out: &ldquo;Do you want total war?&rdquo;, an audience of 15,000 leaps to its feet. For a moment, the applause fades. Then Goebbels takes a stance with his arms akimbo, and shouts out: &ldquo;Do you want a war - if it has to be &ndash; more radical and total than anything we can imagine today?&rdquo; The crowd erupts with an ecstatic &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Goebbels screams out another ten questions. He energetically conjures up the spectre of a triumphal procession of the Bolshevists across Europe, and his words &ldquo;...Fate&rsquo;s greatest wake-up call to the German nation&rdquo; <sup>3 </sup>echo around the hall.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A new era for the Sportpalast arena&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the Second World War, the Sportpalast lies in ruins. In the post-war years, the arena is reconstructed. A new era starts with crowds streaming into the venue for sports events and concerts. Now, the big names on stage here include jazz legends such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, as well as rock&rsquo;n&rsquo;roller Bill Haley. Later, the Sportpalast also hosts such stars as Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But by the early 1970s, that era is over. The venue is no longer profitable. On 13 November 1973, the Sportpalast is torn down. An apartment block is constructed on the site. A plaque on the building at Potsdamer Stra&szlig;e 172 recalls a dark chapter of German history with the abuse of this location by the Nazi regime and the infamous speech by Joseph Goebbels, Hitler&rsquo;s Propaganda Minister.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>Summer 1943, a few minutes past midnight. In the darkness, a deathly hush hangs over the Jewish cemetery in Wei&szlig;ensee, along with the scent of moss and freshly turned soil. Suddenly there&rsquo;s a rustling sound. A group of people emerge from the darkness and hurry across the cemetery. One of them stumbles over a fallen gravestone. They stop in front of a magnificent mausoleum, climb onto its roof, lift a glass plate and slip inside. They have found a safe place to spend the night.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p><strong>The largest Jewish cemetery in Europe </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;re standing in front of that very tomb. One of Berlin&rsquo;s greatest singers, opera star Joseph Schwarz, is buried here. It is one of the 116,000 graves that make Wei&szlig;ensee cemetery the largest Jewish cemetery in Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Berlin&rsquo;s Jewish community established the cemetery in 1880. Simple graves stand next to magnificent mausoleums. Some of them have been designed by famous architects such as Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius. It is also the final resting place of many well-known Berliners, including department store founders Adolf Jandorf (KaDeWe) and Hermann Tietz (Hertie), hotelier Berthold Kempinski and publishers Samuel Fischer and Rudolf Mosse. These names reflect the confidence and assimilation of Berlin&rsquo;s Jews in the imperial era.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walk past the tomb on the right and follow the narrow path between the graves and bushes. Turn left after 250 metres. This is the burial place of Jewish soldiers who fell in the First World War. This is also where young Harry Kindermann and his friends used to run around after a ball in the early 1940s. Really? A game of football among the gravestones? Rabbi Kindermann doesn&rsquo;t mind the boys running around. The cemetery is the size of 60 football pitches and it&rsquo;s one of the few places where they can run around in safety. The streets of Berlin are too dangerous. Harry spends much of his childhood in the cemetery. The children can eat wild plums and apricots from the trees that grow there.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking back, Harry has fond memories of the place that allowed him to play, laugh and fall in love for the first time. And hide &ndash; like in that tomb. Under the Nazis, Jews escaped persecution by hiding in the mausoleums. Sometimes they stayed one night, sometimes several days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Surviving the war and the surrender </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Wei&szlig;ensee cemetery never closes. It was one of the few institutions in Germany that remained in the hands of the Jewish community during the Nazi era. War-time air raids on Berlin damaged around 4,000 graves and destroyed the plant nursery and the new hall of remembrance. But the cemetery survived. Three days after the war ended, the Jewish community was once again holding religious services at the Jewish cemetery in Wei&szlig;ensee.</p>\r\n",

Just starving, suffering, dying &ndash; and killing time. <sup>1</sup> This is how Stalinism expert Frank Nemetz describes life in the ten special camps set up by the NKVD, the Soviet Interior Ministry, after May 1945. Their aim is different to that of the Nazi concentration camps: torture through isolation. The prisoners are given nothing to do and are not allowed any contact with their families.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They are imprisoned without trial. Under the pretext of preventing harm from &ldquo;anti-Soviet opponents&rdquo;, the Soviets arrest Nazi functionaries, SA and Gestapo members, political opponents and &ldquo;suspicious&rdquo; young people. People are denounced at random or sent to Sachsenhausen simply for being unpopular. Many innocent people end up in Special Camp No. 7.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The terror is back </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around 60,000 people were imprisoned here between 1945 and 1950; around 12,000 starved to death or succumbed to disease, mental and physical exhaustion or the terrible conditions. They can never escape the stench of cesspools, putrefaction and disease. Every day, bodies are buried outside the camp.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, when you stand on the site of the former camp, you are a free person in a place where freedom was abolished for 14 long years. Special Camp No. 7 was set up on the site of Sachsenhausen concentration camp in August 1945. The Nazi terror that reigned over the site from 1936 to 1945 has now been transformed into a new kind of tyranny. In 1948 it is renamed Special Camp No. 1 and becomes one of the three biggest special camps in the Soviet occupation zone. At first the inmates are allowed to play board games, exercise, listen to the radio and read the newspaper.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But time hangs over them like the sword of Damocles. Their days are dominated by uncertainty and isolation. How long will I have to stay here? Will I ever see my family again? Will I survive? Special Camp No. 1 is dissolved shortly after the founding of the GDR, but only some of the prisoners are released. 5,500 prisoners are moved to GDR prisons. Those who are released are threatened with punishment if they talk about their time in the camp. The GDR completely conceals or plays down the existence of the special camps.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyone who is lucky enough to be released from one of the camps is a different person from when they went in. After his release from Special Camp No. 2, painter Otto von Kursell (&dagger; 1967) described his health and finances as being &ldquo;in ruins&rdquo;. <sup>2</sup></p>\r\n",

A little girl cowers helplessly next to a dead Red Cross nurse. 23-year-old Soviet soldier Nikolai Ivanovich Massalov screws up his courage, crawls to the bridge and rescues the crying child from the hail of bullets.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>It&#39;s not unusual for heroes to be recognised for their courage &ndash; but the honour bestowed on Sergeant of the Guard Massalov takes on a whole new dimension. The story of his daring act reaches Yevgeny Vuchetich, whom the Soviet military administration commissions in 1946 to create a memorial to the fallen Soviet soldiers. After hearing the story, the sculptor decides to create a massive statue of a Red Army soldier carrying a child in his arms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A Red Army soldier standing over a broken swastika&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The memorial in Treptower Park is inaugurated on 8 May 1949, the fourth anniversary of the end of war. All eyes are drawn to the huge statue inspired by the heroic deed at Potsdam Bridge. Vuchetich&rsquo;s soldier stands on a high pedestal on the mausoleum hill &ndash; the imposing bronze figure is 30 metres tall. With his sword lowered and a shattered swastika beneath his boots, the statue symbolises victory over the Nazis and the hope of a future lived in freedom.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Covering some 100,000 square metres, the main Soviet War Memorial in Treptower Park is the largest in Germany, but it was not the first to be built. A memorial was constructed in the Tiergarten in November 1945, and the Sch&ouml;nholzer Heide and Buch memorials in Pankow were erected in 1947. All four complexes also house war cemeteries. Around 80,000 Red Army soldiers were killed in the battle for Berlin, and more than 20,000 have found their final resting place at one of these four memorials.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Like a film set&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Tiergarten, Treptow and Sch&ouml;nholzer Heide memorials are all built in a monumental style and reflect the grandiose stylistic ideals of Soviet realism. The sheer size of the memorial in Treptower Park is perhaps the most obvious example of this aesthetic. With its arched entrances, huge flags carved from red granite and an impressive view of Vuchetich&rsquo;s colossal statue, the complex looks like a set for a film about the Soviet era.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, more than 70 years after it was built, the huge statue still amazes visitors from all over the world. We still don&rsquo;t know the name of the girl who is immortalised in the arms of the bronze soldier. Her saviour, Nikolai Ivanovich Massalov, died on 10 December 2001 in Kemerovo, Siberia.</p>\r\n",

Berlin is as Truman so aptly remarked &ldquo;a ghost city&rdquo;. <sup>1&nbsp;&nbsp;</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Potsdam as the stage for world politics </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are now in the courtyard of the Cecilienhof Palace, completed in 1917 for the former imperial Hohenzollern rulers. Untouched by the Second World War, this is the perfect location for the delegations of the Victorious Allies. The streets of Potsdam are transformed into a high-security area, controlled by Allied soldiers and especially by Soviet troops. With Stalin&rsquo;s paranoia and persecution mania, the high levels of security are a must.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you enter the Conference Room today, you first notice is the massive round table. With a diameter over three metres, the table was especially made in Moscow for this meeting. The leaders of the negotiations sit in the three armchairs. The room is filled with thick clouds of cigar and pipe smoke &ndash; President Truman is the only passive smoker present. In this stuffy atmosphere, one thing soon becomes clear &ndash; after Nazi Germany&rsquo;s unconditional surrender, the Allies no longer have a shared enemy or common interests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>None the less, they do agree on the &lsquo;Four big Ds&rsquo; &ndash; Germany&rsquo;s denazification, demilitarisation, decentralisation and democratisation. The country is to be divided into four zones of occupation, each administered with relative political freedom by one of Allied Powers. In the middle of this fateful meeting, the results of the general election in the UK are announced. The Labour Party has won a sweeping victory. The new Prime Minister Clement Attlee replaces Churchill at the negotiating table in Potsdam. But Attlee &ndash; a man Churchill once slightingly refers to as &ldquo;a sheep in sheep&rsquo;s clothing&rdquo; &ndash; is no match for Stalin. He proves unable to stop Stalin&rsquo;s proposal of making the Oder-Neisse line Germany&rsquo;s eastern border to Poland, resulting in the expulsion of around 12 million Germans from central-eastern Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Enter the Cold War&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the United States Army detonates a test atomic bomb in the desert in New Mexico. From Potsdam, Truman orders atomic bombs to be dropped on Japan. The bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki cost the lives of 250,000 people and mark the start of the nuclear arms race over the coming decades. In 1949, the Soviets explode their own nuclear bomb, re-establishing the &ldquo;balance of terror&rdquo;. The former Allies became competitors and enemies &ndash; resulting in the division of Germany and Europe into East and West. If you stroll the few metres from the Cecilienhof Palace to the banks of the Jungfernsee lake, you are standing directly in front of one concrete outcome of the Potsdam Conference until 1990 &ndash; the former border between East and West Germany.</p>\r\n",

"mainText": "<p>In the summer of 1945 Berlin is in ruins and occupied by Allied troops. Every state authority has collapsed following the defeat and unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany. Yet people have no sense of liberation. All they feel is hunger and hopelessness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In June, the four victorious powers announce that they will assume and exercise supreme authority over Germany. The<em> Berlin Declaration</em> is signed by the four most powerful men in the country: General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Marshal Georgi Zhukov, Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery and General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny. Germany is divided into four zones and the commanders-in-chief of the USA, the Soviet Union, Great Britain and France have total discretion over how they administer their particular zone. But they are keen to make joint decisions on issues that affect the country as a whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>An administrative authority is set up&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 10 August 1945, the four men meet in the Plenary Chamber of Berlin&rsquo;s Kammergericht, a monumental, neo-Baroque building that has survived the war almost intact. Outside, the American, Soviet, British and French flags fly from the four flagpoles that still stand here today. The items on the Allied Control Council&rsquo;s agenda include the key objectives of the Potsdam Agreement: demilitarisation, denazification, decentralisation and, above all, rebuilding defeated Germany along democratic lines.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their delegates and interpreters then meet to tackle all the legal and organisational details on the 10th, 20th and 30th of each month. There is general agreement on the need to annul Nazi laws, dissolve and liquidate Nazi organisations and destroy any literature and works of a National Socialist and militarist nature.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But as time goes on there is a growing sense of mistrust, particularly on the part of the Soviet Union towards the Western allies. All too often, the Control Council &ldquo;decides&rdquo; to make no joint decision. On 20 March 1948, the Soviet representative walks out of the Allied Control Council. This paralyses the whole administrative apparatus, with all its directors, committees and working groups. The division between East and West that keeps Europe in suspense until 1990 has reached the Plenary Chamber of the Berlin Kammergericht.</p>\r\n",

"mainText": "<p>No one in the GDR is really free. Yet nowhere are East Germany&rsquo;s citizens further from freedom than in the subterranean bunker-like cells in the Stasi&rsquo;s secret remand prison in Hohensch&ouml;nhausen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prisoners there dub this damp and cold tract of cells the U-Boot &ndash; the &ldquo;Submarine&rdquo;. In the windowless cells, with a light bulb burning 24-hours a day, the prisoners feel as if they are deep under the sea &ndash; submerged, lost, beyond help.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Ministry of State Security (Stasi) lock Peter R&uuml;egg up here in a U-Boot cell in August 1959, and maltreat him over a period of months, he thinks &ldquo;Here, they can do what they like with you.No scream or cry ever escapes these walls.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The suffering here begins under the Nazis&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The history of human suffering in Hohensch&ouml;nhausen goes back to the war years. Even during the Second World War, the Nazi regime packs prisoners into barrack huts on the site of a Nazi welfare organisation canteen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the war ends, the Soviet forces in Berlin turn the former large canteen into their Special Camp No. 3 for political prisoners. Conditions are catastrophic. By 1946, hundreds have died. Afterwards, the Soviet secret police use the site for five years as a remand prison. The feared U-Boot tract of cells also dates from these years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you visit the memorial today, just imagine you would never escape these torture cells. Not only were the prisoners flogged and beaten, but also deprived of sleep or had ice-cold water poured over them. What seems inconceivable today was then the cruellest reality inside these walls.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Psychological terror replaces physical maltreatment&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1951, the Stasi finally takes over the building, turning it into East Germany&rsquo;s top-secret remand prison. Until 1989, over 10,000 men and women are held here. In the late 1950s, the Stasi close the notorious cellar cells. But this does not mean the end of torturing prisoners &ndash; just that the methods become subtler.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prisoners not only spend long stretches in solitary confinement, but Stasi staff sometimes hold invented phone calls in a prisoner&rsquo;s presence, pretending something dreadful has happened to one of the prisoner&rsquo;s close relatives. For the prisoners, the uncertainty is usually worse than any physical maltreatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, none of the prisoners in Hohensch&ouml;nhausen knows where they are. For many of the prisoners, the most worrying question was: Have I been taken out of Germany?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only after the Wall comes down does the East German Council of Ministers close all the Stasi remand prisons. On 2 October 1990, just one day before German reunification, the Hohensch&ouml;nhausen remand prison is finally shut down and placed under West Berlin&rsquo;s legal administration. Yet even today, Siegfried Rataizick, head of the secret prison from 1963 until it closed, denies all accusations. In an interview in 2002, he says: &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t miss a single day for the world. I&rsquo;d do it all again anytime.&rdquo; <sup>2</sup></p>\r\n",

The authorities discovered them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What he doesn&rsquo;t know is that the regime has turned the former workhouse and National Socialist collection point for &ldquo;anti-social&rdquo; elements into a brutal prison. Behind its walls, inmates are now subject to the new rules of the GDR&rsquo;s penal system: security, work and education &ndash; whatever the cost. The State Security Service, known as the Stasi, is responsible for the &ldquo;political operational processing&rdquo; of the prisoners and has its own employees and informers on the premises. Male prisoners are no longer guarded by trained staff but by the Vopos (Volkspolizei, the East German police) &ndash; with a dangerous mix of military drills and arbitrary punishments.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Resistance is futile&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hartmut Richter repeatedly protests against the prison&rsquo;s inhumane conditions and even goes on hunger strike. But it is impossible to fight the system. Solitary confinement, violence, chaining, endless interrogations and forced labour for state-owned companies are all part of daily prison life. The Vopos make no distinction between &lsquo;real&rsquo; criminals and political prisoners, indeed quite the opposite.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Peaceful protests are met with police brutality&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 7 and 8 October 1989, Rummelsburg becomes a &ldquo;central collection point&rdquo; for the Stasi. Anyone who takes part in peaceful demonstrations in East Berlin &ndash; and even innocent passers-by &ndash; can be arbitrarily arrested and carted off. The regime displays its brutality by forcing the detainees to stand for hours in overcrowded garages on the prison grounds, faces to the wall, hands up, legs spread. Anyone who collapses with exhaustion immediately feels the thwack of a police baton. Anyone who closes their eyes is yelled at. No-one is allowed to visit the toilet, they simply have to go where they stand. The drama increases when they are herded to the cells in the basement. 46 men are packed into 16 square metres. In desperation, women beg to be allowed home to their children, who have been left alone for hours. But sympathy is as rare as the oxygen in this confined space. After hours of interrogation, most of them are finally released. <sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, three five-metre-high steles commemorate the prison&rsquo;s three eras.

Look upon this city and know you cannot, you must not, forsake us.&rdquo; And his appeal is heard.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>You are now on the Platz der Republik, the square in front of the Reichstag Parliament building. The square covers around 40,000 square metres, an area equivalent to roughly six to seven football pitches. On 9 September 1948, Berlin residents crowd into this space to hear speakers in front of the Reichstag ruins. They have some eventful days behind them. Three days before, the city assembly in the Rotes Rathaus in the eastern sector is the scene of harassment and unrest. Members of the Socialist Unity Party, which has strong links to Moscow, violently disturb the session, but the East Berlin police do not intervene.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, in June the Soviet forces already seal off land and water access to the sectors of Berlin under the Western Allies. The blockade hangs like a dark shadow over the divided city. At that time, Ernst Reuter is the elected Lord Mayor of Berlin, but the Soviets refuse to recognise his position. He knows his city is facing a crucial test &ndash; and his appeal must make itself heard. Reuter is a man of the people with a very chequered biography. But as he moves forward to the rostrum his past is unimportant, whether as a former Communist, a left-wing social democrat, a concentration camp inmate or an &eacute;migr&eacute; under the Nazi regime. He knows exactly what is at stake &ndash; the freedom of the 300,000 people gathered to hear him, and the future of all those threatened by Communism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>From the rostrum to the entire world&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>His voice echoes over the square: &ldquo;Today is the day when the people of Berlin raises its voice. Today, the people of Berlin are calling to the entire world.&rdquo; <sup>1 </sup>Enthralled, his audience follow his speech closely as he talks of the hungry Russian bear not just ready to swallow up Berlin, but all of Germany. Yet rather than seeking to fuel people&rsquo;s fears, Reuter wants to break out of the victim role. Each of his words is a challenge to the threat from the East: &ldquo;We cannot be traded, we cannot be bartered away, and we can also not be sold.&rdquo; For him, Berlin in ruins is &ldquo;a bulwark, an outpost of freedom&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rhetoric against repression&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>His appeal to the determination of Berlin residents in the western sectors is enthusiastically received, with the huge square erupting into applause. Even well beyond Berlin and Germany&rsquo;s borders, Reuter&rsquo;s appeal is heard. The nations he calls on are ready and willing to support the divided city. Finally, with the Allied expansion of the airlift, the Soviet blockade is breached and defeated.</p>\r\n",

"mainText": "<p>Students are increasingly being spied on and forced to attend compulsory lectures on politics. This leads to ever-louder calls for a new, independent university to be set up.

Their demands are given a sympathetic hearing. General George Hay, High Commissioner of the US sector, sets up a special committee and gives the project the go ahead. This is followed by a meeting of professors, lecturers, politicians and students, including West Berlin&rsquo;s Mayor, Ernst Reuter. This group is now responsible for the process of setting up the Free University.

In the absence of tables and chairs, documents are laid out on the floor. Fortunately, the building has a telephone, as lots of people are already interested in applying for a place. Helmut Coper is elected Chairman of the General Student Council and works closely with Ernst Reuter and the US authorities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their help is vital, particularly during the Berlin Blockade, when power cuts mean that lectures have to be given by candlelight.

But this time the Allies are transporting a different, a valuable load &ndash; urgently needed relief supplies for a beleaguered city.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 24 June 1948, Stalin orders power to be cut off to the western sectors of Berlin. Just a little later, the road, rail and water routes to the divided city are blocked. People in the streets are just as alarmed as the western Allies. This is more than Soviet sabre-rattling. This is a threat to freedom, striking at the heart of over 2,200,000 people trapped in the city. Within just a few hours, confidence has turned to fear &ndash; how long can we survive like this?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Will we fall into the hands of the Russians?&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not if American Military Governor General L. D. Clay has anything to do with it! He isn&rsquo;t planning a military counterstrike, but a remarkable logistical feat &ndash; an airlift using all available Allied military planes from across the world. Under the Nazis, Tempelhof Airport was a place of forced labourers and armaments production, an architectural symbol of the regime&rsquo;s claim to power. Now, it quickly develops into a place of hope. Clay&rsquo;s &ldquo;Operation Vittles&rdquo; achieves the seemingly impossible &ndash; forging allies from victors and the defeated, fighting side by side to save Berlin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Turning enemies into friends&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every day, 1500 tons of food are flown in to West Berlin. At the busiest times, planes land and take off every three minutes, not only bringing tinned goods, coal, and so on, but also a belief in the goodness of humanity. Thousands of the pilots also pack in candy bars and chewing gum tied into bundles on tiny parachutes. As they approach the runway, they throw the little bundles out of the cockpit window. As they sail down to the ground, these sweet gifts capture the hearts of the waiting children. In total, the airlift flies in nearly one and a half million tons of coal, and almost half a million tons of food.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the night of 12 May 1949, after 322 days, the Soviets finally lift the blockade &ndash; West Berlin is saved.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>On the trail of the Candy Bomber&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the Airlift Memorial commemorates Berlin&rsquo;s friendship with the Allies and the 79 people who lost their lives in the course of the operation. If you stand with your back to the airport building&rsquo;s former main entrance, you can&rsquo;t miss the memorial, twenty metres high and made of reinforced concrete. For the locals, the memorial also has a nickname, ironically dubbed the &ldquo;<em>Hungerharke</em>&rdquo; (literally &ldquo;hunger rake&rdquo;). The three struts pointing west symbolise the three air corridors open to the planes. Originally, architect Eduard Ludwig plans an installation in light alloy, but it does not meet the building regulations. He also wants it to be a unique piece, but there too he will be disappointed. His second design is accepted and built &ndash; followed by a replica in Frankfurt am Main in 1985 and a third memorial in 1988 in Celle, both locations where Candy Bombers once took off for Berlin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Probably the most impressive testament to the airlift is a real Candy Bomber, a Douglas C-47 B Skytrain, set on the roof of the newly constructed terrace of the German Museum of Technology not far from Potsdamer Platz.</p>\r\n",

With its long, 185-metre-long strips of windows, brass door frames and walls clad in travertine, the result is an attractive blend of Bauhaus and Art Deco.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>What happens behind the fa&ccedil;ade is also a source of pride. Jazz greats like Ella Fitzgerald and Duke Ellington perform in the Badewanne, the jazz club in the basement. And on 29 October 1949, it writes a new chapter in political satire when it premieres a cabaret troupe called <em>Die Stachelschweine (The Porcupines)</em>. Their first show is retrospectively named <em>Alles irrsinnig komisch</em> (Everything Is Hilarious), and it goes on to be staged every Tuesday and Friday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How does humour work in the new democracy? Thierry, whose real name is Dieter Koch, writes the shows with cabaret founder Rolf Ulrich. He comes up with the name Die Stachelschweine because they want to be prickly, pointed and push the envelope of post-war, post-Nazi Germany. Alexander Welbat, Klaus Becker and Joachim Teege are some of the troupe&rsquo;s first freewheeling performers, alongside future TV stars such as G&uuml;nter Pfitzmann.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second show, called <em>per-speck-tiefen</em>, opens up new horizons for the young ensemble. At the Badewanne, conflicts with another cabaret troupe lead to a change of venue. The Stachelschweine move to the Burgkeller restaurant at Kurf&uuml;rstendamm 12 in February 1950. Their involuntary tour continues via the N&uuml;rnberger Trichter restaurant to the Ewige Lampe at Rankestra&szlig;e 9, where the ensemble stays for twelve years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Straight-talking, Berlin style </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, the Stachelschweine has included numerous witty, sharp-tongued cabaret artists who have shaped the cabaret genre in Berlin. Achim Strietzel is so good at imitating Governing Mayor Willy Brandt that people stop him in the street and ask him to &ldquo;Do Willy&rdquo;. Then there&rsquo;s fast-talking Wolfgang Gruber; Wolfgang Neuss, whose famous catchphrase is available today as a fridge magnet; and Berlin&rsquo;s own Edith Hancke, who began her long career with the Stachelschweine in the Fifties. When she died, Berlin&rsquo;s newspaper <em>Der Tagesspiegel</em> simply headlined her obituary: &ldquo;The eternal brat&rdquo;. <sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>They all turn the politics of reconstruction and economic miracle into satire &ndash; and some of the audience find their laughter sticks in their throats. Subversive and enigmatic, the Stachelschweine turn the spotlight on the Nazi heritage, the grotesqueness of two German states and the neuroses that develop in a front-line city like Berlin. The troupe survived the division of Germany and still play seven nights a week at the Europa-Center.</p>\r\n",

They are joined by Konrad Adenauer and US General Lucius D. Clay, who is about to make the replica of the famous Liberty Bell chime for the very first time. At 12 noon precisely, General Clay throws the switch. Everyone looks up in anticipation &ndash; but nothing happens.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p><strong>A gift from the USA </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Freedom Bell has made a long journey to get here. In early 1950, Lucius D. Clay &ndash; known as the &ldquo;Father of the Berlin Airlift&rdquo; &ndash; makes a proposal to the new National Committee for a Free Europe. He suggests making a replica of the famous Liberty Bell so that West Berlin has its own symbol of freedom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>16 million Americans donate money so that the bell can be cast and sign the following declaration of freedom: &ldquo;I believe in the sacredness and dignity of the individual. / I believe that all men derive the right to freedom equally from God. / I pledge to resist aggression and tyranny wherever they appear on earth.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bell cast in London is called the Freedom Bell. It acts as a reminder of all the people who are unable to live their lives in freedom. Clay initiates a Crusade for Freedom &ndash; the ten-tonne bronze bell travels right across the USA before reaching its final destination at Sch&ouml;neberg Town Hall on 21 October 1950.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you stand on Rathausplatz, where John F. Kennedy spoke those famous words &ldquo;Ich bin ein Berliner&rdquo; in 1963, it&rsquo;s hard to grasp the true scale of the Freedom Bell. High up in the 70-metre bell tower, it weighs 10,206 kilograms and measures 2.6 metres across.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>From the Town Hall tower to the world&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>General Lucius D. Clay must have had quite a shock when the bell didn&rsquo;t ring &ndash; but fortunately this hasn&rsquo;t been repeated. Right on cue, the Freedom Bell rings out for two minutes at 12 noon every day. It also chimes at midnight on 1 May, Christmas Eve and New Year&#39;s Eve, and marks major political events, such as the reunification of Germany on 3 October 1990. Two days after the 9/11 attacks, the bell tolled for 7 minutes in memory of the victims.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what was the problem on 24 October 1950? It was nothing serious &ndash; when General Clay threw the switch, he blew the fuses in the improvised electrical system. Fortunately, some workers up in the bell tower started physically pushing the bell &ndash; and the Freedom Bell began to chime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its premiere was broadcast by 2,000 radio stations around the world. From then on, the bells and the declaration of freedom were broadcast at noon every Sunday on RIAS radio, a station set up by the US military administration in West Berlin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the Freedom Bell is the biggest non-church bell in Berlin. When it rings out at noon every day, it reminds us of something very precious: our freedom.</p>\r\n",

"mainText": "<p>Food rationing, night-time power cuts, post-war cities in ruins and an empty public purse. At the start of the Fifties, the mood in East Germany has hit a new low. The planned economy is failing to deliver results quickly enough. High reparation costs and the collectivisation of agriculture are simply making a difficult supply situation even worse. People are increasingly voting with their feet and leaving East Germany. The situation is explosive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The big bang, when it finally comes, is triggered by the SED leadership&rsquo;s announcement in May 1953 that there would be a 10% increase in work quotas. This means that already underpaid workers have to work even longer hours for the same meagre wages. This provocative decision by the Politburo proves to be the final straw that sends workers to the barricades.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SED officials thrown into cesspools&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rebellion starts in the provinces. On 12 June 1953, protests break out in many small towns. Mayors are stripped of their office, SED officials are beaten up and even thrown into cesspools. In the G&ouml;rlitz and Niesky districts citizens even manage to remove the hated SED regime for a few hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tensions are also starting to build in the capital. On 16 June, construction workers on Stalinallee rush to the aid of colleagues who are allegedly being harassed by the Volkspolizei. They occupy a construction site, move on to the House of Ministries and the protest starts to spread. Thousands of people take to the streets, and now they have more than work quotas on their minds. They are calling for the government to step down, for free elections, press freedom and the release of political prisoners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That same day, the Politburo advises the government to repeal the controversial new work quotas, but it&rsquo;s too late. Years of accumulated rage have caused the situation to escalate, with tragic consequences. On the morning of 17 June the protests spread to the whole of the GDR. The Soviet occupiers have been steering East Germany&rsquo;s political fortunes since the end of the war with a strict process of Stalinisation. Now they can&rsquo;t afford to lose control with the eyes of the world upon them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Death sentences and Siberian labour camps&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the night of 17 June, Soviet army units march on Berlin and the crackdown begins. The protest that was fuelled by hope quickly becomes a bloodbath as tanks clear the city&rsquo;s streets and squares. 34 demonstrators are shot and killed by soldiers and the Volkspolizei. The Soviets execute insurgents and sentence hundreds more to detention in forced labour camps in Siberia. Later on, estimates suggest that GDR judges imprison another 1,600 insurgents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SED uses the rebellion as an opportunity to purge its own ranks. Moderates lose their jobs and mass surveillance increases. From now on, it becomes more and more difficult for dissidents and opponents to oppose the regime. It will be another 36 years before GDR citizens finally overthrow their oppressors.</p>\r\n",

"mainText": "<p>In the late 1960s, Biermann finds himself under enormous pressure from the East German regime. The state has effectively banned the lyricist, singer and composer of political songs from working. Biermann is not allowed to perform or publish his songs. His lyrics are too accurate, his criticisms too pointed, his satire too caustic and creative. The regime decides to muzzle him.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Barred from professional recording studios, he starts recording his first album at home. He smuggles in a top-quality Sennheiser microphone, which picks up the sound of trams and Trabants driving by. This would normally be a musician&rsquo;s nightmare, but here it acts as a perfect time capsule. The street sounds in the background are a charming reminder of how, in the GDR, criticism can only be articulated behind closed doors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biermann&#39;s LP <em>Chausseestra&szlig;e 131</em> is eventually released in West Germany. Later on, the singer comments: &ldquo;The title should have been: This particular Bierman is banned in the East, (...) but it&rsquo;s not like he&rsquo;s actually in hiding, he has a name and address in Berlin, easy to find for both friend and foe&rdquo;. <sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For many years, his apartment was as a meeting place for the intellectual opposition, and attracted Western celebrities such as Udo Lindenberg, Heinrich B&ouml;ll, Rudi Dutschke and Joan Baez. But Biermann&rsquo;s closest confidant and most regular visitor was Robert Havemann. During the Third Reich, Havemann worked for Communist International&rsquo;s intelligence service and was a founding member of the European Union &ndash; not today&rsquo;s organisation, but a Berlin-based antifascist resistance group. He was arrested and sentenced to death in 1943 but was never actually executed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the GDR, Havemann quickly became a leading critic of the regime and a friend and mentor to Wolf Biermann. But their time together in Chausseestra&szlig;e came to an abrupt end. After his concert in Cologne on 13 November 1976, the GDR expelled the songwriter and banned him from returning to East Berlin. At a stroke, Biermann had lost his friend Havemann and his legendary home.</p>\r\n",

Dr Fritz Moser is keen to learn more about its public libraries, which are considered a cornerstone of American democracy. Back in Berlin, he puts into practice what he has learned. The Amerika-Gedenkbibliothek (American Memorial Library) is destined to become a beacon of intellectual freedom on the River Spree.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>Just a few years earlier, Moser could only dream of a making this kind of overseas research trip. The Nazis banned the philosopher from putting pen to paper. However, in 1946, the Greater Berlin authorities put him in charge of the Department of National Education &ndash; partly because he remained untainted by the Nazis.

A donation from the American government turns the concept into reality.&nbsp; At the laying of the foundation stone in 1952, US Secretary of State Dean Acheson explains why his country has provided funding for the library: &ldquo;It is the freedom to learn, to study, to seek the truth.&rdquo; <sup>1 </sup>The most modern library in Europe opens two years later &ndash; and its director is Fritz Moser.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The people of Berlin are amazed by this gift from their liberators because the twelve-storey building is so different from the libraries they are used to. In the past they had to ask for a particular book title at the counter, but now they can simply wander through the shelves and select their own books. Librarians no longer have power over the knowledge they disseminate. Now they are just there to administer and advise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Years of oppression and Nazi censorship have left people thirsting for knowledge, and the new library is a huge hit from day one. The number of books and borrowers increases steadily as the years go by, and today the library has around 3,500 visitors a day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Girls in headscarves and Kreuzberg punks&quot;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the occasion of the library&rsquo;s 60th anniversary, Berlin&#39;s former State Secretary of Culture, Andr&eacute; Schmitz, sums up what the library is all about: &ldquo;At the American Memorial Library you&rsquo;ll find girls in headscarves and Kreuzberg punks, the Berlin Philharmonic getting its sheet music, fans selecting from a huge range of international films (...) In Germany&#39;s largest children&rsquo;s library, kids can find cosy corners to read in, while parents can get advice on the best books for their children.&rdquo; <sup>3 </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fritz Moser remains the library&rsquo;s director until he retires in 1973.

But its reporters are everywhere. During the Berlin blockade of 1948 to 1949, RIAS try to buoy up the city&rsquo;s residents by sending loudspeaker vans out on the streets. The station broadcasts Walter Ulbricht&#39;s statement that &ldquo;No one has any intention of building a wall&rdquo;, <sup>2 </sup>along with readings from literature that is banned in the GDR. During the 1950s, 70 to 80 percent of listeners are in the GDR. The East German regime views it all as provocation. It sets up a plethora of jamming stations in an attempt to block the station&rsquo;s transmissions &ndash; but fails miserably.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You&rsquo;ve got mail&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Broadcasts such as <em>Berlin Speaks to the Zone</em> and <em>Meeting Place </em>are particularly popular. Thousands of people write in to the station, though many letters never get there because they are confiscated by the Stasi. RIAS employs a number of ruses to get around the problem, such as setting up alias addresses. Listeners also protect their identities with aliases so that they don&rsquo;t get caught sending in requests and dedications. Draconian punishments are meted out to people who are caught listening to Western radio stations. But even this fails to dampen East Germans&rsquo; enthusiasm for RIAS and AFN, the American Forces Network. The AFN is actually aimed at the military, but English-language music is popular on both sides of the Wall. Even after the Wall comes down, RIAS and AFN retain many loyal listeners until they eventually stop broadcasting in 1993 and 1994.</p>\r\n",

The opposition demands the resignation of Berlin&rsquo;s Secretary of the Interior, and governing mayor Willy Brandt has to apologise. As for the Americans themselves, they take it all in their stride. Their attitude underlines the fact that this building on Hardenbergstra&szlig;e has been designed to be an open, tolerant space. It&rsquo;s a place where people even have the freedom to criticise the United States and its policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Turning Nazis into democrats </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Amerika Haus opens in Kleiststra&szlig;e in 1946, initially as a reading room.

Scott Fitzgerald.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the post-war years, Americans believe that Germans need to learn how to live in freedom according to basic democratic principles. The Amerika Haus is part of this re-education programme &ndash; and, of course, a way of disseminating propaganda.

Jackson Pollock exhibits his paintings, G&uuml;nter Grass debates with Uwe Johnson, Pulitzer Prize winner Rita Dove reads her poems, Richard Nixon and Robert Kennedy pay a visit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Berliners are free to use the extensive library and attend concerts, theatre performances, film screenings and language courses.

"mainText": "<p>Architect Ego Eiermann feels more than annoyed. On 25 March 1957, his design for rebuilding the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church wins the architectural competition. He plans to entirely demolish the old church, left in ruins by the war. But unexpectedly, the locals fight fiercely to save their ruined church, fondly nicknamed the &ldquo;hollow tooth&rdquo; &ndash; and they succeed. You are now standing in front of the ruins of the old bell tower.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eiermann has to integrate this ruin into his revised design. As a poignant reminder of the horrors of war, the ruins are to stand as a memorial. The old bell tower is framed by four new structures &ndash; a church and a foyer, the new bell tower and a chapel. The end result is a compromise unifying the modern architecture with the historical fragment from the war.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Island of peace </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you look around, you can see the new bell tower on the left in the shadow of the ruins. The single storey chapel is in front of the bell tower. On the other side of the ensemble of buildings, the Kurf&uuml;rstendamm boulevard is as busy as ever. Behind you, there is the noise of the traffic on Budapester Stra&szlig;e. Now, if you go up the five steps and enter the new church on the right, the first thing you&rsquo;ll hear is &ndash; nothing at all. This is an island of peace in the heart of the bustling metropolis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Egon Eiermann designs the church with a double wall to keep the noise of the big city at bay. The double wall has another effect as well, one for which the church is famous &ndash; it glows in a deep blue light. This effect is due to the powerful lights (today, energy-saving LED light bulbs) set in the two-and-a-half-metre gap inside the double walls. The lights shine on the blue glass mosaic windows, creating the glow inside and outside. The 23,000 individual glass panes for the church are the work of French artist Gabriel Loire. Installed only a few years after the end of the war, they show just how formative the idea of reconciliation is for Berlin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A church for peace </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The inside of the church is also rich in symbols of reconciliation. For example, the bronze plaque commemorating those who died opposing the Nazi regime and, set next to it on the north wall of the church, the Stalingrad Madonna.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On Christmas Eve 1942, during the long and bitter Battle of Stalingrad, German army doctor Kurt Reuber sketched this moving Madonna image in charcoal on the back of a map of Russia. Today, copies of the sketch also hang in the Russian Orthodox Cathedral of Volgograd (formerly Stalingrad) as well as in Coventry Cathedral in England.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a member of the Community of the Cross of Nails, the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church has another link with Coventry as well. The Memorial Hall of the old ruined spire includes a Cross of Nails made from nails found in charred roof beams in the old Coventry Cathedral, almost entirely destroyed during a wave of German bombing raids on 14 November 1940. As a sign of peace and reconciliation, the Cross of Nails is gifted to the memorial site in 1987.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church is consecrated on 17 December 1961. Shortly after East Germany gives a concrete form to the division of Germany in the shape of the Berlin Wall, the western part of the city creates this symbol of freedom and reconciliation.</p>\r\n",

The result is the building you see in front of you. Because of its height and colour, this high-rise building in the Hansaviertel district is known as the Giraffe. It is 53 metres high and has 164 studio apartments over 17 floors.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>The International Building Exhibition (INTERBAU) in 1957 proves to be a stroke of luck for architects Klaus M&uuml;ller-Rehm and Gerhard Siegmann. Not only do they get to work with other top international architects on the designs for a whole new quarter, but they are also picked to draw up the plans for its tallest building.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>From rubble to modernist minimalism&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original plan is for a single high-rise building to be built on a vast expanse of rubble. West Berlin Senate&rsquo;s Building Director Ludwig Lemmer thinks the project is too big for M&uuml;ller-Rehm to handle on his own, so he brings in Gerhard Siegmann. The latter is also an advocate of minimalism and is experienced in making the most of scarce building materials. They make a strong team, but the Giraffe project still has its share of challenges. Money problems mean the completion date is pushed back several times.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A response to Moscow-style socialist boulevards&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>West Berlin&rsquo;s Senate is determined that the prestigious INTERBAU project must not fail. It has to be a response to the &ldquo;wedding-cake&rdquo; socialist architecture of Karl-Marx-Allee on the other side of the Wall. The GDR regime commissioned architect Hermann Henselmann to build &ldquo;workers&rsquo; palaces&rdquo; on the first socialist boulevard. Now it is the turn of top architects such as Alvar Aalto, Walter Gropius, Oscar Niemeyer, Pierre Vago, Luciano Baldessari, Max Taut and Le Corbusier to give West Berlin its own new architectural apparel. While Le Corbusier&#39;s planned building has to be moved closer to the Olympic Stadium, the other architects get to realise their visions in the Hansaviertel. But not without compromises. Building regulations take their toll. Indeed, they cause so many problems that most of the international architects take down their nameplates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, the tower block is spared these problems. It earns the nickname Giraffe because of its colour and the restaurant of the same name on the ground floor. It is the first building to go up in the Hansaviertel.</p>\r\n",

They have barely hung their homemade Allied flags at the windows and come to terms with their Soviet occupiers when a new Allied power arrives on the scene.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>On 12 August 1945, the French are the last of the four Allies to take control of their Berlin sector &ndash; the districts of Reinickendorf and Wedding. But it soon becomes clear that the new occupiers will not be adopting a policy of laissez-faire. French commander General Geoffrey de Beauch&ecirc;sne issues a clear decree: &ldquo;France harbours no thoughts of revenge, but demands strict discipline and help from the local population in eliminating the Nazi regime.&rdquo; <sup>2</sup> There will be no retaliation, but not everyone likes the ensuing crackdown. Whenever the Tricolour is raised, they have to stand to attention and remove their hat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of Reinickendorf&rsquo;s residents are forced out of their homes to make way for the French administration, and houses and apartments are requisitioned. The French sector commander says these seizures are just a fraction of what the Germans appropriated in France during the war.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vive la France in Reinickendorf&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem is exacerbated when the army families move in. Accommodation is scarce in bombed-out Berlin. In 1952, the French decide to convert Camp Foch, which previously housed French gendarmes, into a complex called Cit&eacute; Foch. It is turned into apartments, a church, cinema, swimming pool, schools and a shopping centre and the street streets are blue, just like in France. In 1991 Cit&eacute; Foch houses 2,600 French army personnel and their families but is closed to civilians. The sealed-off complex with elegant street names such as Rue Montesquieu also houses military facilities, including a listening station with transmitter mast on Cyclopstrasse/Rue Montesquieu and the Berlin-Waidmannslust radio station.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>From tr&egrave;s chic to tr&egrave;s triste&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the early years, the shopping centre proves popular with the occupying powers, and Soviet officers also come here to buy their wine. Architecturally, Cit&eacute; Foch has been designed very much with function in mind. When the French move out, much of the complex falls into disrepair and is demolished, apart from a few residential buildings. Today, a new Cit&eacute; Foch is being built &ndash; but it still has the blue-and-white street signs with their melodious names.</p>\r\n",

Six metres below the city streets they have laid 450 metres of cable, moved 3,000 tonnes of earth and used 125 tonnes of steel. In August 2012, Werner Sabolewski, a former civilian employee of the East German army, is looking for firewood in the Pasewalk forest &ndash; and makes an amazing discovery.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p><strong>A tribute to the Western powers </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What he finds in the forest takes us back to one of the most exciting stories from the early years of the Cold War: a secret spy tunnel under Berlin. From May 1955 to April 1956, the CIA and Britain&rsquo;s MI6 use the tunnel to listen in on 440,000 of the Soviet army&rsquo;s telephone and telegraph communications. More than half a century later, this top-secret site still exists and is on public display at the Allied Museum in Berlin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why do the Allies have their own museum in Berlin? It is a thankyou to the Western powers for their commitment to restoring democracy and freedom &ndash; especially in West Berlin. The former enemies were welcomed as friends during the post-war years, particularly because of their help during the Berlin Airlift of 1948-49. In 1993, with the support of the USA, Great Britain and France, an international commission of experts drew up plans for a museum in honour of the Big Three.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Helmut Kohl opened the first exhibition at the museum in September 1994, on the eve of the Western powers&rsquo; final departure from Berlin. The museum is housed in the Outpost Theatre, a former US military cinema, and in the Nicholson Library. These were favourite haunts of US soldiers and their families in the post-war period. The exhibitions focus on the daily lives of the American, British and French communities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How can a tunnel be displayed in the museum? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The museum&#39;s many highlights include the last guardhouse from Checkpoint Charlie, a transport aircraft from the days of the Airlift &ndash; and, of course, the legendary spy tunnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part of the tunnel was discovered during motorway construction in 1997 &ndash; a seven-metre section of steel tube, large enough to walk through. The steel tube was later transported to the museum for restoration before being put on show. The sections that Werner Sabolweski stumbled across five years later are now held in the Museum&rsquo;s archives. Rainer Lemke, a member of the Pasewalk parish council, comments: &ldquo;This is a piece of Cold War history. It&rsquo;s vital that such finds are preserved for posterity.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Allied Museum was officially inaugurated on the 50th anniversary of the Airlift in 1998. By 2006, half a million people had already visited the exhibitions and this figure had doubled by 2013. Plans are underway to move the Museum to a new home in the former Tempelhof Airport in 2020/21. It is likely that the move will attract even more visitors to this unique exhibition dedicated to Germany&rsquo;s post-war history.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, the section of spy tunnel from the 1950s will move too &ndash; taking it a little closer to its original location, the former sector border between Neuk&ouml;lln and Treptow.</p>\r\n",

Now, two days later, a special task force is guarding the start of construction work on the wall that will split the city in two. Millions of East Germans have already fled to the West since 1945. Now the SED regime is putting a stop to this, even though their leader, Walter Ulbricht, said the exact opposite just two months earlier.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On this day, 15 August 1961, Conrad Schumann is one of the men guarding the temporary barbed wire border that has been erected on Bernauer Stra&szlig;e. He is in charge of two other officers, Erich Fierus and Peter Kr&ouml;ger. But while these two are conscientiously carrying out their duties, Schumann has the scent of freedom. The pavement on Bernauer Stra&szlig;e is in West Berlin. Just a leap away. Just one leap.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Everything seems possible&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Conrad Schumann still hesitates. Behind the barbed wire, the volume increases. Photographers, cameramen, onlookers &ndash; everyone is calling out to him. Some are hurling insults, calling him a &ldquo;Russian lackey&rdquo;; <sup>1 </sup>others are urging him to flee. Schumann lights another cigarette. The barbed wire fence is low. Fierus and Kr&ouml;ger are carrying ammo, but it is safely stowed in their pockets. Everything seems possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just a stone&rsquo;s throw away, in the Western part of the city, a cluster of photographers includes young photojournalist Peter Leibing. A cub reporter with the Conti-Press agency, he has been keeping his eye on the soldier with the cigarette. Onlookers tell Leibing that they have seen him pressing down the barbed wire. Checking the border is safe? Or preparing to escape? Peter Leibing stands and waits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Conrad Schumann knows that if he jumps he might never see his family again. But if Ulbricht&rsquo;s &ldquo;anti-imperialist wall&rdquo; goes up, he may be trapped in East Germany forever.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Leibing is an expert with moving targets&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter Leibing senses that something is about to happen. He trains his East-German-made camera on the soldier. With its 200-mm telephoto lens, this Exacta camera can capture anything. He has often taken photos at show jumping tournaments, so he knows how to photograph a moving target.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Fierus and Kr&ouml;ger move away, Conrad Schumann takes his run-up and leaps over the fence, dropping his Kalashnikov in the process. Peter Leibing captures the iconic image that flashes around the world. The escaping border guard becomes the worst PR nightmare of the SED regime. The photo was added to UNESCO&rsquo;s Memory of the World programme in 2011.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schumann later married, had a child, and moved to Oberemmendorft in Bavaria.

It became a &ldquo;gateway to the democratic sector&rdquo;. <sup>1 </sup>It was not only a gateway for the many cross-border commuters who failed to return to the Eastern sector, but also for illicit goods.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Closing the gap in the system&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 13 August 1961, the regime takes action. Today&rsquo;s U-Bahn lines 6 and 8 and the S-Bahn&rsquo;s north-south line (today&rsquo;s S1, S2 and S25) were no longer allowed to stop at the 16 stations in East Berlin. Passengers who got on in the West could only alight in the West.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>East Berlin train lines that are manned by West Berliners but not allowed to stop in the East? The absurdity of such a system sparks an outcry, spearheaded by Berlin&rsquo;s mayor Willy Brandt, who fumes: &ldquo;It is unacceptable that Western proceeds from the S-Bahn are being used to buy barbed wire.&rdquo; <sup>2 </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And indeed, the border police are equipping the platforms with fences, barbed wire obstacles, walls, beds of nails and guards galore.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Even the guards are escaping&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ironically, up to 1966 it was the regime&rsquo;s own people who were taking advantage of this underground escape route. A quick visit to the toilet, a moment without surveillance &ndash; and border guards were regularly disappearing through the emergency exits and tunnels. The authorities respond by gradually installing rolling grilles in the tunnels, locking the emergency exits, and in the end they even wall in the sentries. Now only officers can unlock the doors, and the guards have to watch over the platform through small windows &ndash; through which they can shoot if necessary. Many civilians try to escape via this route, and at least ten lose their lives in the attempt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the former Nordbahnhof ghost station is part of the Berlin Wall Memorial and houses an exhibition entitled &ldquo;Border Stations and Ghost Stations in Divided Berlin&rdquo;.

"mainText": "<p>The glass fa&ccedil;ade of the Tr&auml;nenpalast - the &ldquo;Palace of Tears&rdquo; &ndash; rises directly in front of you. The vast row of windows of this former border control hall is deceptive. Built under East Germany&rsquo;s SED regime, this is not a light-flooded architecture of welcome. Instead, it is a silent witness of tragic scenes of farewell. During the division of Germany, this border crossing hall was nicknamed &ldquo;The Palace of Tears&rdquo; after the tears that flowed where you are now standing. Anyone bidding goodbye to relatives or friends here could never know when or if they would see them again.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Free architecture&rdquo; meets control mania&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1961, railway architect Horst L&uuml;deritz is planning a very open, modern building in keeping with the contemporary architecture of his day. His steel construction is eight metres high with a trapezoid-shaped roof and long windows down to ground level. The building is intended as an easily monitored connection to Friedrichstra&szlig;e Station. It soon becomes clear that L&uuml;deritz does not have a free hand in his design. The East German SED regime likes the visual impression, but not the planned realisation. Made of glass - yes. But transparent? No, thank you very much! Ultimately, the windows do not actually reach the ground. Later, parts of them are also covered by building elements and signs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A needle&rsquo;s eye to freedom&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside, it is all about tearful farewells; inside the passport control units, under Stasi command, are waiting. Passport control always followed the same sequence. When you enter the &ldquo;Palace of Tears&rdquo;, you have to present a valid passport. Then you are subject to a strict customs check, and then an intensive passport check. You hardly see anything of the light design of this glass-fronted hall. Instead, signs take you down a series of enclosed corridors snaking through the building&rsquo;s 500 sq. metres, leading you ever closer to the final check &ndash; the notorious control booth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Where fear rules&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The control booth is narrow and long. When you enter, the door automatically closes behind you. The exit door in front is also closed. Neither door has handles on the inside. The passport official sits behind a raised counter with a glass pane looking down at you, or up in the mirror giving a view of the entire floor of the booth. You hand over your passport. This is not a place for pleasantries. If you leave with just a few words, you consider yourself lucky. Conversation here often means lengthy and gruelling questioning. In some cases, people are even taken off for a body search. Some spend hours here before the buzzer finally sounds, the exit door opens, and they can continue to Friedrichstra&szlig;e Station. Not everyone passes through this procedure unscathed. Attempts to escape from the GDR are foiled, and fates are sealed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once, the Tr&auml;nenpalast is intended as a symbol of the socialist system&rsquo;s superiority. Today, it is home to &ldquo;Border Experience. Everyday Life in a Divided Germany&rdquo;, a fascinating permanent exhibition also showing some of the original equipment and furnishings in the &ldquo;Palace of Tears&rdquo;.</p>\r\n",

The city&rsquo;s brutal dividing line runs directly in front of these residential buildings. He opens his doors to tourists and anyone who&rsquo;s interested in what is happening on the border. His exhibition proves to be so popular that he relocates it to the Haus am Checkpoint Charlie on 14 June 1963. From being purely a museum, it quickly becomes a focal point for demonstrators, journalists, refugees and escape helpers, who have a perfect view of the checkpoint from its small window.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it doesn&rsquo;t escape the authorities that the premises are also being used to plan escapes. Rainer Hildebrandt is subjected to several kidnap attempts, but he allows nothing to distract him from his peaceful fight against injustice. His museum grows with the stories of each new escapee.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Escaping over, under and through the Wall&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you see some of the exhibits it&rsquo;s hard to believe your eyes. People escaped by hiding in a car&rsquo;s petrol tank, building a home-made submarine and &ndash; in the &ldquo;escape of the century&rdquo; &ndash; two families flew over the wall in a hot air balloon in 1979. The museum also reveals the horror of the border&rsquo;s deadly self-firing weapons, the ruthless border guards, the tragic stories of those who died and suffered at the hands of the regime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fall of the Wall is a dream come true for Hildebrandt. He has always longed for &ldquo;freedom in unity&rdquo;, and now it has arrived. And the Haus am Checkpoint Charlie itself becomes a witness to history.&nbsp; Today the exhibition also covers broader themes, such as non-violent revolutions around the world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>BlackBox Cold War&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just a few metres from the Checkpoint Charlie house stands a black cube.

And, of course, everything has to be done secretly, furtively, quietly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But they get there in the end. 145 metres long, the tunnel runs from the cellar of an old bakery on the west side of Bernauer Stra&szlig;e to an unused toilet building in the courtyard of Strelitzer Stra&szlig;e 55 in East Berlin. On the nights of 3 and 4 October 1964, the tunnel is a ray of hope for 57 East German citizens. The escape organisers are armed with pistols &ndash; just in case. But they are unaware that the Stasi has got wind of the tunnel.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the second night, two men from the Stasi pretend to be part of the group who are nervously waiting to escape. They are so convincing that the escape organisers let them pass. The Stasi also enlist the help of a third &ldquo;escapee&rdquo; &ndash; East German border guard Egon Schultz. Shortly after midnight he receives the order to shoot, and there&rsquo;s a rapid exchange of fire in the tunnel. Schultz is killed by his own men.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an open letter to Egon Schultz&rsquo;s mother, the escape organisers describe what happened and claim that: &ldquo;The real killer is [...] the system, which deals with the mass exodus of its citizens not by eliminating the causes, but by erecting the WALL and ordering Germans to shoot other Germans&rdquo; <sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The escape tunnel is later called Tunnel 57, after the 57 people who managed to escape.

These representative offices are like embassies, but this is a term that West Germany is keen to avoid at all costs. It is prepared to recognise the GDR as a sovereign state, but not as a foreign country. In contrast to the two-state theory of the GDR, Germany&#39;s political aim is clear: reunification.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>West Germany&rsquo;s Permanent Mission opens in Berlin-Mitte in 1974. It is headed up by SPD politician G&uuml;nter Gaus. The mission&rsquo;s permanent representatives in East Berlin handle negotiations on transport routes, travel and cultural projects. But alongside their daily work they regularly face a more difficult task: helping East Germans to escape. This West German oasis in the heart of East Berlin represents a ray of hope for many citizens living under the iron fist of the SED. It provides a way for them quietly and discreetly slip into the West, such as by buying their way out.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A crazy four weeks </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The situation comes to a head on 26 June 1984. 55 East Germans, including 13 children, occupy the mission, which Berliners call the &ldquo;White House&rdquo;, demanding exit permits. Inge Albrecht was 20 at the time. In 2014 she recalls: &ldquo;The worst thing was not knowing how long we&rsquo;d be in this situation (...) and would it even work?&rdquo; <sup>1&nbsp;&nbsp; </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For four weeks in 1984, the former Permanent Mission, which you can visit today at Hannoversche Stra&szlig;e 28-30, was bursting at the seams. Conditions quickly deteriorated, as former deputy director Hans Otto Br&auml;utigam recalls: &ldquo;We cleared out the offices and laid out mattresses on the fifth floor (...) The atmosphere was explosive&rdquo;. <sup>2 </sup>For a while, the Mission had to abandon its principle of always being open to visitors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Permanent Mission regularly hits the headlines </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 16 February 1989, a family crashed their Trabant through the barriers outside the Mission, but they were still allowed to leave. The Mission had to close its doors again on 8 August 1989, when 131 GDR citizens occupied the building.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, a plaque at the former east entrance commemorates the escape route that led people to freedom before 3 October 1990.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And what about the occupiers in 1984? The story has a happy ending &ndash; after tough negotiations between East and West, they were all granted permission to leave in July.

"introtext": "<p>Rainer Eppelmann is going to die. It&rsquo;s been decided. A little tampering with his car followed by a fake accident &ndash; the Ministry for State Security has the assassination all planned out. The drama unfolds in the mid-1980s when Eppelmann, the pastor at the Church of the Good Samaritan, is driving his Trabant over a crossroads in East Berlin. A car pulls out in front of him and the collision causes Rainer Eppelmann to fly head first through the windscreen.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>A few years earlier, young people are dancing to blues music in the Church of the Good Samaritan in Friedrichshain. Someone is reading from the Bible, everyone feels free to enjoy themselves. It&rsquo;s not quite the normal image of the German Democratic Republic. But the Blues Masses held by the Samaritan church in East Berlin, are something special. They have been going on since 1979, giving young people a chance to escape the restrictions of living in the GDR &ndash; at least for the duration of the service. It&rsquo;s all thanks to their organiser, Rainer Eppelmann.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He is not only the pastor at the Church of the Good Samaritan but also a committed pacifist, conscientious objector and member of the opposition movement in his community. He is not one to mince his words when it comes to political grievances. He has been a thorn in the side of the East German regime for years. When he publishes his Berlin Appeal in 1982 calling for disarmament in both East and West it&rsquo;s seen as a milestone along the road to peaceful revolution &ndash; and Eppelmann is now considered an enemy of the state.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A tradition of rebellion </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even during the days of National Socialism, the Church of the Good Samaritan is at the heart of the opposition movement based around the Confessing Church&rsquo;s Emergency Covenant of Pastors. Under the GDR the church becomes a nucleus of the peace movement and the birthplace of one the country&rsquo;s largest opposition groups. This is all helped along by the popular Blues Masses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And Rainer Eppelmann? He breaks several vertebrae in his neck but survives the crash. He is slowly recovering when his career takes an unexpected turn. In May 1989, his church&rsquo;s Peace Circle takes part in a campaign to expose electoral fraud during municipal elections in East Germany. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Eppelmann becomes one of the founding members of Democratic Awakening (DA), a political party that merges with the CDU in 1990.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;We had won&rdquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following the first and last free elections to the GDR People&#39;s Chamber on 18 March 1990, Eppelmann becomes the country&rsquo;s first Minister for Disarmament and Defence. One of his main tasks is the dissolution of the National People&#39;s Army &ndash; a source of great satisfaction to a pacifist like Eppelmann. <sup>1</sup> He remains in office from 12 April to 2 October 1990 and to this day, Rainer Eppelmann is the only disarmament minister the world has ever seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today Eppelmann lives in Berlin and is chairman of the Federal Foundation for the Study of Communist Dictatorship in East Germany. In an interview in 2009, he talks of the moment he appeared before the GDR&rsquo;s generals in his new role as minister of disarmament: &ldquo;...that was the first time it really hit home: we had won&rdquo;. <sup>2</sup></p>\r\n",

It&#39;s 17 October 1987, just after 10pm. 2,000 East Germans have flooded into the church to see a concert by the West Berlin band Element of Crime.

"mainText": "<p><strong>A hub of resistance </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The church in Berlin-Mitte has a chequered history. Pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer worked here during the Second World War. As part of the church opposition movement, he was an active member of the resistance against the Nazi regime. He was executed in the Flossenb&uuml;rg concentration camp in 1945. On the west side of the church you can see a bronze memorial to this resistance fighter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later on, when Germany is divided into East and West, the Zionskirche is still a meeting place for opposition groups. In 1986, parish priest Hans Simon allows the &ldquo;Umweltbibliothek&rdquo; (Environmental Library) to be set up in the basement of the parish hall. The library contains banned books and magazines on environmental and human rights topics. Opposition groups also hold meetings in the basement. Of course, the East German regime is not happy about the meetings of the Zion Church Peace and Environmental Circle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, in October 1987, there&rsquo;s the concert by Element of Crime. The band&rsquo;s singer Sven Regener describes his impressions on entering East Berlin: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like a parallel universe just around the corner (...) like another version of West Berlin. Bizarre.&rdquo; <sup>1 </sup>Regener also says he expected the East Berlin police to turn up. But it&rsquo;s not the Stasi who storm the Zionskirche.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Skinhead attack and Stasi raid </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s actually violent neo-Nazis who attack the concert-goers. Many are seriously injured, but the police simply stand and watch. East Germany&rsquo;s Socialist Unity Party plays down the attack at first, but when news of the incident spreads throughout Germany, it has to admit that the GDR has a problem with neo-Nazis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Less than a month after the skinhead attack, the church is the target of a Stasi raid. On the night of 24-25 November 1987, they storm the Environmental Library and arrest its members. The raid triggers nationwide protests and demonstrations of support. The GDR regime has no choice but to release the prisoners and tolerate the presence of the library.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After German reunification in 1990, work begins on restoring the church, which was badly damaged during the Second World War. Historian Dirk Moldt, one of the organisers of the Element of Crime concert, expresses his hope that the church won&rsquo;t be given &ldquo;too much of a makeover&rdquo;. The scars of history should not be covered over. <sup>2</sup></p>\r\n",

He is met by a chorus of jeers and boos. The hands of the once powerful man start to shake. Civil rights activist B&auml;rbel Bohley notices his nervousness and in that moment realises for the very first time that &ldquo;The revolution is irreversible&rdquo;. <sup>1</sup>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Less than a month earlier and the GDR is celebrating its 40th birthday with an ostentatious military parade for state visitors such as Mikhail Gorbachev and Nicolae Ceausescu. Although they don&rsquo;t realise it at the time, this is the day that the SED leadership will sow the seeds for the Alexanderplatz demonstration a few weeks later &ndash; because citizens protesting against the anniversary celebrations are brutally chased away and beaten by the People&#39;s Police and the Stasi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The demo is not anti-GDR, but pro-democracy&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the organs of state security do not intimidate the GDR&rsquo;s dissidents with this orgy of violence. Quite the opposite: the citizens&#39; movement New Forum and representatives of East Berlin&rsquo;s theatres use the attacks as justification for calling the demonstration on 4 November. The strategy adopted by the civil rights activists and regime critics is simple &ndash; they are not demonstrating against the GDR but in favour of a new democratic socialism, freedom of speech and freedom of the press.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the event kicks off at 10am on 4 November in front of the ADN (General German Intelligence Service) building in Mollstra&szlig;e, it quickly develops into the biggest non-governmental demonstration in the history of the GDR. Hundreds of thousands of people converge on the Palast der Republik before moving on to Alexanderplatz for the final rally with 20 speakers from the arts and politics.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The protesters come up with some witty and creative slogans for their banners, such as &ldquo;Send the Stasi to Benghazi&rdquo;.<sup> 2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The intellectuals want to save the GDR, but it&rsquo;s too late&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feelings in the country are running so high that the rally is even broadcast on GDR television. Stasi shills among the demonstrators have little effect &ndash; the crowd cheers loudly for authors like Christa Wolf and actors Ulrich M&uuml;he and Jan Josef Liefers, while Politburo member G&uuml;nter Schabowski and former spy Markus Wolf are mercilessly booed and jeered.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking back, historian Ilko-Sascha Kowalczuk believes that &ldquo;The event was sustained by a belief that nothing should remain as it is&rdquo;, <sup>3</sup> &ldquo;Freedom had to come&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christa Wolf, Friedrich Schorlemmer and other speakers call on people not to leave the country &ndash; but these intellectuals are also a little out of touch with the prevailing mood.

In the border crossing point at East Berlin&rsquo;s Bornholmer Stra&szlig;e, Lieutenant Colonel Harald J&auml;ger is keeping the situation under observation. Events are moving fast. When he takes a break, he watches TV. Just like thousands of others, he hears of a new travel ruling for East German citizens. They will be allowed to cross freely to the West, effective as of now. Freely crossing to the West? But that means they&rsquo;ll come to his crossing point too!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The times are pointing to freedom&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the passport unit&rsquo;s officer of the day, Harald J&auml;ger contacts his superior officer. The response is total disbelief. J&auml;ger&rsquo;s superior has heard nothing about a new ruling on crossing to the West, and thinks J&auml;ger is exaggerating about crowds at Bornholmer Stra&szlig;e. But outside people are already pushing forwards chanting &ldquo;Open the gate&rdquo;. Inside the crossing point, the air of insecurity is palpable. Lieutenant Colonel J&auml;ger knows he has to act. After all, with the crowd waiting to cross to the West constantly growing, it would only take a spark to cause a riot. At last, Harald J&auml;ger manages to reach the responsible authority. He is given permission for an emergency solution. Known as the &ldquo;safety valve regulation&rdquo;, this allows those shouting loudest to cross.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Let the troublemakers go&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyone aggressively demanding to cross to the West is allowed through. They have a stamp put in their passport, just covering their photo. But they don&rsquo;t realise this stamp is an identification, so when they want to return to East Germany, they will be stopped at the border. Even if they knew, it wouldn&rsquo;t change anything. As far as they are concerned, &ldquo;The main thing is to cross to the West!&rdquo; The pressure keeps building. Evermore people are arriving on foot and in their Trabi cars. Harald J&auml;ger knows that if a panic starts, everyone would suffer. So around 11.30 pm he decides against the regime, and for a peaceful solution. He lifts the checkpoint barrier, and a flood of cheering people stream over the B&ouml;sebr&uuml;cke to the West. The border is open!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the square in front of the former crossing point is called Platz des 9. November 1989. There, you can find an open-air exhibition commemorating the over 20,000 people who crossed the border in the first hours, as well as the later fall of the Berlin Wall. The square is just a short walk to the other side of the B&ouml;sebr&uuml;cke bridge &ndash; once the site of the East German border crossing point.</p>\r\n",

"mainText": "<p>The grey architecture of oppression. That&rsquo;s one way of describing the dreary office buildings you see before you. When you look at the former Stasi headquarters from the inner courtyard, it feels like it is towering over you. This is typical of a surveillance state where the individual is subordinated and has to conform. What happens behind the walls and countless faceless windows? Interrogations, violence, reprisals of all kinds.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This exhibition is dedicated to the brave men and women who stood up to the regime between 1945 and 1989.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The many faces of the Revolution&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Intellectuals, church leaders, young people, opposition members, dissidents &ndash; their faces all look out at at the Stasi headquarters. They taste triumph at last. Their photos and documents seem to say: <em>Look at me. You thought you could silence our voices. But the only thing that is silent is the old, soulless lump of concrete that you once called your headquarters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1,300 square metres of peaceful protest&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The exhibition panels cover most of the courtyard at the Stasi HQ. The first part is dedicated to the beginnings of the Revolution. The first people&rsquo;s protests against the communist regime of the GDR and the rest of the Eastern Bloc began on 17 June 1953.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The protest groups were a mixed bunch. There was the peace movement with its strong &ldquo;swords to ploughshares&rdquo; symbol, the environmental movement and its subculture, and the regime&rsquo;s active opposition. A community of peaceful freedom fighters began to take shape.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second part of the exhibition focuses on the Revolution and sheds light on what happened in the last months, weeks and days before the fall of the Berlin Wall &ndash; from the Monday demonstrations in Leipzig to the mobilisation of hundreds of thousands of people on Alexanderplatz.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The long-awaited turning point, the fall of the Berlin Wall, is the link to the third part of the exhibition, which deals with unity and its consequences. The first free elections, sceptical voices, the new freedom &ndash; the exhibition takes us on an authentic journey through history with numerous large-format photos, prints of leaflets and newspaper ads and other recordings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>The morning of 10 February 1962 dawns cold and clear over Potsdam. At precisely 8.44am, a man steps onto the Glienicke Bridge. He walks slowly across the river Havel towards Berlin. He is the American pilot Francis Gary Powers &ndash; and when he reaches the halfway point, he knows he is finally free.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>Six minutes later, KGB Colonel Rudolf Ivanovich Abel crosses the bridge in the opposite direction. The first exchange of spies on German soil between the United States and the Soviet Union has gone without a hitch. The exchange is top secret, but information still leaks out to the public. Glienicke Bridge in Berlin&rsquo;s south west hits the headlines and becomes famous around the world at the &ldquo;Bridge of Spies&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The perfect bridge for secret operations&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s no coincidence that the US and USSR want to use this particular location for their top-secret exchanges. This steel construction first opened in 1907 as the Kaiser Wilhelm Bridge. Ironically, the GDR government later changes its name to the Bridge of Unity. It turns out to be the perfect place for conducting intelligence missions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike the checkpoints in the city, traffic is light. In winter, the bridge disappears into the mist that hangs over the Havel. It&rsquo;s easy for representatives of the two superpowers to reach the bridge from Berlin and simple to monitor and secure the surroundings. So it&rsquo;s hardly surprising that, after the successful premiere, the Iron Curtain rises twice more to allow real or supposed agents to walk free.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But we have to wait 20 years for the sequel. After years of intense negotiation, on the morning of 12 June 1985 the normally deserted bridge is a hive of activity. A bus is waiting on the Potsdam side of the bridge. It contains East Germans, Poles and an Austrian. Some of them have been in prison for years on suspicion of spying for the CIA. Limousines and minibuses approach the bridge from the West Berlin side. They are bringing four former spies from Warsaw Pact countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>23 US agents for 4 Soviet spies&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This exchange of prisoners has been mediated by Wolfgang Vogel, the GDR&rsquo;s famous negotiator. Once again he has done a good job: as the clock strikes noon, 23 US spies and 4 Soviet agents cross the border over the Havel. This time the agents are driven to the white border post in the middle of the bridge, where they simply swap vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third and last spy exchange on the Glienicke Bridge also goes smoothly. On 11 February 1986, four prisoners from the East are exchanged for five from the West. After German reunification, this wormhole between the two superpowers reverts to being a normal transport link. But the <em>Bridge of Spies</em> has never lost its fascination. In 2015, director Steven Spielberg visits this original location to shoot his film of the same name starring Tom Hanks.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>Germany&#39;s first communes are an attempt to break down the antiquated, conservative structures of post-war society through left-wing ideas and the creative power of political protest. They fail to last &ndash; but succeed in changing the country.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>Students go to university in suits and ties, unmarried people aren&rsquo;t allowed to live together, women need their husband&rsquo;s permission to go out to work. These days it&rsquo;s hard to imagine the prudish, conformist mentality that still dominates West Germany in the late 1960s.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Antifascism and the removal of toilet doors&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s February 1967 and a group of nine left-wing students led by Fritz Teufel and Dieter Kunzelmann have had enough of a narrow-minded society that suppresses individual freedoms and turns a blind eye to Nazi crimes. Together they set up Commune 1 in West Berlin. It is not only Germany&#39;s very first commune, but also a radical alternative to the country&rsquo;s conservative norms. Private property no longer exists, toilet doors are removed to do away with personal refuges, everyone supposedly loves everyone else.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The students view the German nuclear family as a breeding ground for fascism. They want their commune to give men and women the freedom to be themselves, and provide a nonconformist alternative.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For two years, these creative provocateurs and political activists make international headlines. They plan a &ldquo;pudding assassination&rdquo; of US Vice President Humphrey and are described by the Springer press as &ldquo;horror communards&rdquo;. The commune moves into an apartment in Niedstra&szlig;e, and then later to Charlottenburg and Moabit. Members come and go.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rebels are treated like pop stars&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the model Uschi Obermaier joins the group, nude pictures start doing the rounds and celebrities like Jimi Hendrix start dropping by. The revolutionary project mutates into something of a media phenomenon and the communards are treated like the pop stars of the extra-parliamentary opposition. They start charging for photo shoots and interviews and founding members are thrown out for drug addiction and having affairs. It seems some freedoms are now beyond the pale, even for Germany&#39;s most famous rebels. Commune members are drawn into heated arguments about their political direction, there is growing hostility from outside the group and conflict becomes the order of the day. Then the commune is attacked by rockers, and it breaks up in 1969.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looking back, the commune&rsquo;s wild and decadent lifestyle seems to have been staged to some extent. &ldquo;Free love - that was just propaganda. None of that really happened&rdquo;, recalls communard Dagmar von Doetinchem. <sup>1 </sup>But there&rsquo;s no doubt that Commune 1 exposed the authoritarian state to ridicule and sent out a liberating political message to the whole of Germany. It flew the flag for equality and inspired the house-sharing culture that swept the country in the 1980s.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The &ldquo;political commune&rdquo; is even more short-lived&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &ldquo;political commune&rdquo; known today as Commune II and set up in August 1967, breaks up after just one year. The group, which is pioneered by Rudi and Gretchen Dutschke, also includes the filmmaker and subsequent Red Army Faction member Jan-Carl Raspe, but it fails in its attempt to combine communal living with joint political action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Self-run housing collectives for teenagers and young adults still exist in Berlin today, such as the Tommy Weisbecker House in Berlin-Kreuzberg. Founded in 1973, it is named after a Red Army Faction member who was killed by the police.</p>\r\n",

She finds an empty apartment. The door is locked, so she simply breaks it open and moves in. Her name is Angela Merkel.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>But Germany&rsquo;s Chancellor was not a squatter in the classical sense. &ldquo;I simply transferred the rent to the state renting agency&rdquo;, <sup>1 </sup>she says later on. Back in the 1980s, Merkel was not the only one to find a home in this unorthodox way. In East Germany, <em>schwarzwohnen </em>&ndash; occupying vacant buildings &ndash; had become the norm. Merkel occupied two properties, first at Marienstra&szlig;e 24 and later in Templiner Stra&szlig;e.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rents at 1936 levels </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Real socialism has produced a severe housing shortage. The government is busy building prefabricated houses while old buildings in the city centres are derelict. Compulsory nationalisation has led to a shortage of skilled tradesmen. The SED freezes rents at 1936 levels, meaning rents stay low but it is impossible for landlords to cover their costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even for the state, letting property in the GDR is a loss-maker. There is no money for renovations and existing housing stock becomes uninhabitable. In the early 1970s, 600,000 people are officially looking for housing, and the trend is upwards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many young people choose to take matters into their own hands rather than waiting for the state housing agencies to act. On average, the waiting list for a new apartment is 10 years. Meanwhile, countless buildings are standing empty because they are deemed uninhabitable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Move in, then register&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the younger generation don&rsquo;t care. They are not looking for comfort, they want freedom. Outside toilets, coal stoves, leaky windows and roofs, no showers &ndash; nothing puts them off. Many of the occupants carry out repairs themselves and register with the police, so the authorities and other residents tend to tolerate them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The young people even voluntarily pay rent, as this increases their chances of staying in the long term. They ask their neighbours for the landlord&rsquo;s bank details and hang on to their receipts. If they are forced to move out of one building, they simply move into another. In this difficult situation, the penalties are limited. Fines are generally low, and evictions are prohibited under GDR civil law. This means that the occupiers often go on to become legal tenants.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The illegal occupations in East Germany provided people with desperately needed places to live. But they also had a psychological effect. The historian Udo Grashoff describes it as an important act of self-assertion by courageous young people, who were often students or artists. He believes the experience of taking action and discovering that state control has its limits was a key element in building the occupiers&rsquo; confidence in the political arena. Who is perhaps the best proof of this theory? Angela Merkel.</p>\r\n",

But, in fact, the building has had a turbulent history since it was built between 1845 and 1847. It has been the scene of many struggles for freedom and independence.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>It started life as a Central Deaconess Institute and Hospital commissioned by King Frederick William IV of Prussia. It was always said that the King &ldquo;only wants to build churches&rdquo;, which should be &ldquo;islands of promise&rdquo;, <sup>1 </sup>but with the new hospital in K&ouml;penick, the monarch sent a signal that public health was also important to him in the industrial age.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the mid-19th century, Bethanien was set amongst gardens and rye fields &ndash; &ldquo;surrounded by greenery&rdquo;, <sup>2 </sup>which was just how His Majesty liked it. His royal preferences were also reflected in the building&rsquo;s architecture. Today, the imposing entrance hall looks more like a church than a hospital. The hospital housed 500 beds, a nursing school and an orphanage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Barbarism or freedom?&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But just a year later, the bloody March Revolution reaches this haven of tranquillity. Theodor Fontane, a pharmacist in Bethanien at the time, notes: &ldquo;... the very day I moved into Bethanien, the militias were fighting on the K&ouml;penick fields, then the people stormed the armoury, and there were alternating calls of &lsquo;The Russians are coming&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Poles are coming&rsquo;. The former were synonymous with the collapse of barbarism, the latter with the establishment of freedom.&rdquo; <sup>3&nbsp; </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1933, the deaconesses are put to the test when the National Socialists try to turn the management of the hospital over to members of their party. But the deaconesses fight back and maintain their independence. Eight years later, the establishment is placed under the authority of the National Socialists&rsquo; welfare organisation, but time is already running out. Bethanien is badly damaged during the Second World War.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The battle for Bethanien continues </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reconstruction work lasts until 1966, but things are rapidly going downhill. The hospital&rsquo;s location close to the sector border means patients no longer come from East Berlin. It closes down in 1970, but the fight for Bethanien is not over. Now there are plans to tear down this magnificent complex. The building is saved after massive protests by conservationists and public campaigns. In 1969, the complex is listed as a historical monument.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 19 December 1971, after a concert by the rock group Ton Steine Scherben, squatters move into the nurses&rsquo; home, the Martha-Maria-Haus. They rename it the Georg-von-Rauch-Haus after a Berlin anarchist and urban guerrilla who had been killed in a confrontation with police the previous year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After much debate, the Berlin Senate finally approves the squatters&rsquo; legal right to occupy the building. In 1973, artists&#39; groups manage to turn Bethanien itself into a centre for cultural and social projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2005, the Yorck59 Group occupies the south wing of Bethanien to prevent the sale of the complex to a private investor. Some 25 social and cultural groups currently use the Bethanien site. We can assume that the deaconesses&rsquo; former hospital will see many more struggles for freedom in the future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>When Swiss musicologist Harry Goldschmidt crosses from East to West Berlin in December 1976 he doesn&rsquo;t arouse any particular suspicion. The East German border guards simply allow him to pass. But in fact he has something explosive in his bag &ndash; a manuscript that, just a few months later, will blow the lid of the GDR regime.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>On 22 August 1977, part of the smuggled text is printed in Spiegel magazine under the title <em>The Alternative &ndash; A Critique of Actually Existing Socialism</em>. On the same day, the East German philosopher Rudolf Bahro admits to being the author of the piece.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his book, Bahro is extremely critical of the GDR, which he says is still a class-based society. He describes the SED apparatus as a &ldquo;machine that is totally cut off from the people&rdquo; <sup>1 </sup>and calls for a new revolution. Never before has an East German citizen written such a scathing indictment of the regime. On the evening of 22 August, ARD and ZDF broadcast a recorded interview with Bahro. Suddenly &ldquo;actually existing socialism&rdquo; comes under massive fire in the Western media.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bahro is known to the Stasi </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next day Bahro is arrested and taken to Berlin&rsquo;s Hohensch&ouml;nhausen prison. He has been on the Stasi&rsquo;s radar for some time. He first came to the attention of the secret service as a student when he criticised the SED regime&rsquo;s position on the popular uprising in Hungary. Later on, he spoke out in support of the Prague Spring.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&rsquo;s only when his <em>Alternative</em> is published that the author finally ends up in jail. He always knew it was coming: &quot;I&#39;ve had almost ten years to prepare for this moment of truth. I&rsquo;m not going to be the victim. I&rsquo;m the one who attacks. Fortunately I was able to choose my moment.&rdquo; <sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Behind bars, Rudolf Bahro is unaware that he is experiencing a huge groundswell of support in the West. Writers such as Heinrich B&ouml;ll and G&uuml;nter Grass are coming to his defence, the first print run of his book sells out before it even hits the shelves in September 1977, and translations of are already in the pipeline. In the GDR <em>The Alternative</em> fails to cause a ripple &ndash; the regime makes sure of that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A new law is passed to deal with Bahro&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But when it comes to Bahro&rsquo;s trial, East Germany&rsquo;s leaders realise they have a problem. It&rsquo;s not actually a criminal offence to publish a political book in the GDR, so they pass a brand new law on intelligence-gathering so that they can try the dissident. The next problem is that the new law refers specifically to passing secrets directly to a &ldquo;class enemy&rdquo;. But Bahro&#39;s manuscript was handed to the German Trade Union Confederation&rsquo;s publishing house, not to the West German government.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But where there&rsquo;s a will there&rsquo;s a way, the author was found guilty and his lawyer Gregor Gysi was unable to keep him out of prison. On 11 October 1979 &ndash; the 30th anniversary of the founding of the GDR &ndash; the state deports its fiercest critic to the West. In 1990<em> The Alternative</em> is published for the first time in East Germany. It is now a country on the brink of collapse. Soon after, the state that Rudolf Bahro once criticised so harshly is consigned to history.</p>\r\n",

"mainText": "<p>A huge, empty hall. A tiny, scruffy bar and a couple of old mattresses. The smell of stale cigarette smoke hangs in the air. The atmosphere is rancid at Kulmer Stra&szlig;e, where SchwuZ was founded in 1977 by the Homosexual Action West Berlin (HAW). It&rsquo;s one of the few places that gay men can meet in a relaxed atmosphere, at a time when society still views homosexuality as &ldquo;verboten&rdquo;, &ldquo;unnatural&rdquo; and &ldquo;perverse&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Driving gay culture underground&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>SchwuZ is extremely political. Paragraph 175 entered Germany&rsquo;s Criminal Code during the 1870s, making homosexual acts between men a crime. They were partially decriminalised in 1969, meaning that homosexual acts would go unpunished under certain conditions. But paragraph 175 was still driving gay culture underground &ndash; into the &lsquo;cottages&rsquo;, the public toilets where gay men meet for anonymous sex.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s why, in 1971, Rosa von Praunheim makes the rousing cry &ldquo;Out of the cottages and onto the streets&rdquo; <sup>1 </sup>in his film <em>It is not the homosexual who is perverse, but the society in which he lives</em>. He calls on gays to come out of the closet and fight actively for equality and tolerance for their way of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The documentary film becomes a vital spark for the lesbian and gay movement. The film&rsquo;s director also provides SchwuZ with its first premises in Dannewitzstra&szlig;e. It was there, and in Kulmer Stra&szlig;e where you are now standing, that gay culture began to take root.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Queers and their gear&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fight for gay rights has its fun side, and SchwuZ hosts some legendary parties. The men&rsquo;s discos held on Saturdays soon become a cult and, decades later, people still remember the amazing drag shows. The drag queens&rsquo; outfits are a revolt against gender stereotypes, and their shrill performances are consciously and entertainingly crossing a boundary. SchwuZ provides a space for activism. Gay schoolboys gather here and set up their own group. It is the home of the pink telephone initiative, which later becomes a gay counselling service. It&rsquo;s the birthplace of <em>Die Siegess&auml;ule</em>, Berlin&rsquo;s gay &ndash; now queer &ndash; magazine. And SchwuZ activists organised Germany&rsquo;s very first Christopher Street Day back in 1979.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three parades and 40 years later, SchwuZ is still a major player in Berlin&#39;s cultural and party scene. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine the city without it. It has changed perceptions of how we live and love, to the point where Berlin&rsquo;s former mayor Klaus Wowereit proclaimed during his campaign: &ldquo;I&#39;m gay - and that&#39;s a good thing!&rdquo; <sup>2 </sup>Society has moved on and nowadays some of the clubbers at SchwuZ are not even aware the part it played in the struggle for gay rights.</p>\r\n",

"mainText": "<p>Knut Hoffmeister is sweating profusely as he drags his huge camera through the club. A few guests have already arrived, the bar staff are serving drinks, the neon lights change from yellow to purple to green. Filming is not allowed, but &ldquo;Lubo the Cerberus&rdquo; <sup>1 </sup>hasn&rsquo;t yet arrived to throw him out. So Hoffmeister sneaks a four-minute recording. It&rsquo;s 1986 and we&rsquo;re in Dschungel &ndash; the hottest, hippest club in West Berlin. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>New freedoms </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The club was first opened by Barbara Brandt and Todora Osikowski on Winterfeldplatz in the mid-1970s. The bar&rsquo;s legendary name &ndash; which was never displayed outside &ndash; came from its decor of palms and a mural of Disney&rsquo;s <em>Jungle Book</em>. It&rsquo;s a place where anything goes. There&rsquo;s no dress code, no focus on profit, no questions about your sexual orientation or where you&rsquo;re from. Jungle nights are all about openness, tolerance, and partying till 4 in the morning. Every night but Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fights are rare, the motley crew of punters are just there to have fun. In 1978, Dschungel moves to N&uuml;rnberger Strasse 53, where it rapidly develops into a stylish and glamorous club, complete with secure entry systems. As Berlin&rsquo;s counterpart to Studio 54, musicians, artists and stars such as Nick Cave, Zazie de Paris, Martin Kippenberger, Prince and David Bowie are to be found mingling with the lesser mortals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bowie is often spotted sitting at the bar, and he&rsquo;s also a fixture at the famous Caf&eacute; Anderes Ufer &ndash; Germany&#39;s first gay caf&eacute;. After all, he and roommate Iggy Pop only live two doors away. In his 2013 song <em>Where Are We Now?</em>&nbsp; Bowie pays musical tribute to the Dschungel (&ldquo;Sitting in the Dschungel, on Nurnberger Strasse&rdquo;) and singer Annette Humpe also gives a nod to her favourite club: &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what&rsquo;s going on at the Dschungel. The music&rsquo;s hot, the neon lights are shining.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The end of an era </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>West Berlin&rsquo;s club scene comes to an end when the Wall comes down. Techno is all the rage, and the party people move on to the clubs in Berlin&rsquo;s new centre. As jungle fever fades, the legendary club finds itself in difficulties. It finally closes its doors on 31 May 1993, but its mythical status remains.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Video 8 clip <sup>2</sup> made by Knut Hoffmeister is the only film in existence that shows the inside of the Dschungel. When you watch it today you can only imagine the atmosphere. The original soundtrack describes the famous club as the &ldquo;hub of Berlin&rsquo;s night life&rdquo; <sup>3</sup> (Walter Sch&ouml;rling, former Dschungel barman), a&rdquo;source of inspiration&rdquo; <sup>4 </sup>(Annette Humpe) and simply &ldquo;the most exciting bar of its time&rdquo; <sup>5 </sup>(Merve publisher Peter Gente).</p>\r\n",

In 1966 he becomes spokesman for the Extra-Parliamentary Opposition (APO) protest movement. By 1967 he is a leading figure in the New Left and coins the phrase &ldquo;the long march through the institutions&rdquo; to describe his strategy of subverting society by infiltrating the Establishment. The movement&rsquo;s mission is to fight against a system that it believes is run by former Nazi officials. As a symbolic figure of protest, Dutschke is often compared to Che Guevara. He even names his first son after him: Hosea-Che.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 11 April 1968, Dutschke goes out to get some medicine for Hosea. A young man in a brown leather jacket asks him: &ldquo;Are you Rudi Dutschke?&rdquo;. <sup>1 </sup>When he says yes, the man shoots him. The two bullets that strike Dutschke in the head also strike at the heart of the 1968 movement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Bild </em>helped to pull the trigger </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The assassination attempt leads to the biggest riots ever seen on Germany&rsquo;s streets. They go down in history as the Easter demonstrations. The protest revolves around the Axel-Springer publishing house. Many blame the assassination attempt on the months of criticism of Dutschke spewed out by the Springer-owned newspaper <em>Bild</em>. Demonstrators attack the publisher&#39;s headquarters in Kochstra&szlig;e chanting &ldquo;Springer &ndash; murderers&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>Bild </em>helped to pull the trigger&rdquo;. <sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The far-right <em>Deutsche National</em> newspaper also wrote &ldquo;Stop Dutschke Now&rdquo; <sup>3 </sup>a few days before the assassination attempt. On 11 April 1968, this newspaper clipping was found lying on the passenger seat of the car belonging to Dutschke&rsquo;s would-be assassin, Josef Bachmann. Eyewitnesses report that Dutschke tried to grapple with Bachmann after the first shot, but two more bullets sent him crashing to the ground.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;I&#39;m sorry to learn that Dutschke is still alive.&rdquo; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rudi Dutschke survives the attack but never fully recovers from his injuries. Bachmann is arrested on the same day, and his right-wing motivation is later revealed. In his statement he says: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to learn that Dutschke is still alive. I should have bought a submachine gun. If I&rsquo;d had the money, I could have ripped Dutschke apart.&rdquo; <sup>4 </sup>He is sent to prison for seven years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Dutschke forgives his attacker and they even exchange correspondence.

"introtext": "<p>&ldquo;<em>Cats </em>&ndash; I can&#39;t imagine anything more boring&rdquo; <sup>1</sup> Volker Ludwig, director of the GRIPS Theatre in Berlin, has very clear ideas about what he thinks makes a good show. His past success suggests he knows what he&rsquo;s talking about. No German musical has ever had more international success than <em>Line 1</em>, apart from Brecht&rsquo;s <em>Threepenny Opera</em>. Yet it all started with a bet!</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>The musical <em>Line 1</em> is a tribute to Berlin, a homage to the down-at-heel, a declaration of love to the lower classes of the divided city. And since its premiere on 30 April 1986, it has become the most-staged German musical ever.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The birthplace of this successful show was the GRIPS children&#39;s and youth theatre in Berlin&rsquo;s Mitte district. Theatre director Volker Ludwig explains how many of its shows since 1975 have been accompanied by rock musicians. But there was one time when he used recorded music, and the musicians complained bitterly. &ldquo;To mollify them, I bet them I could write a musical with 20 songs that would give them lots to do.&rdquo; <sup>2&nbsp; </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>From experiment to export hit </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No sooner said than done! Ludwig pulls together a bunch of existing storylines from his repertoire and gives them a completely new setting on a subway line. The rest of the plot writes itself: ticket inspectors, a tour through different districts of Berlin, some weird and wonderful people, the Wall &ndash; and a country girl in search of romance. At first no-one imagines that this simple story will turn out to be such a huge success.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The actors are sceptical and composer Birger Heymann is even a little embarrassed by the song he writes for the show called <em>Hey du</em>, &lsquo;Hey you&rsquo;. But he&rsquo;s paid a nice compliment when, many years later, it&rsquo;s covered by rapper Sido and punk band the Beatsteaks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After its premiere, the musical gets a lukewarm reception and poor reviews. But after Germany&rsquo;s reunification Ludwig is awarded the M&uuml;lheim Dramatist Prize at the prestigious M&uuml;lheim Theatre Festival and things really start to really take off. <em>Line 1 </em>is performed in 150 venues around the German-speaking world and also becomes an international hit. The famous subway line travels all the way to Vienna, New York and even South Korea.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Line 1</em> features universal characters </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ludwig&#39;s favourite version of <em>Line 1</em> is the one performed in Seoul. He says Kim Min-Ki, the &ldquo;Korean Bob Dylan&rdquo; <sup>3 </sup>was fascinated by the idea and decided to adapt it for his own country.&nbsp; He kept the original music but changed the characters to reflect life in Korea, so the widows of Wilmersdorf became the widows of dictators.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is exactly what audiences like about <em>Line 1 </em>&ndash;&nbsp; it doesn&#39;t have to be set in Berlin. Ludwig says: &ldquo;I&#39;ve created a typical city panopticon that reflects every major city in the world.&rdquo; <sup>4</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>During your stay in Berlin, why not head for the GRIPS Theatre and hop on <em>Line 1</em>? You&rsquo;ll be treated to three hours of great entertainment that&rsquo;s a far cry from <em>Cats</em>.</p>\r\n",

A 5,000-square-metre courtyard for just under two million D-Mark. The Mehringhof collective is keen to ensure that it does everything legally and above board.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It all starts with a grass-roots school </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the end of the 1970s, the SFE school &ndash; which you can still attend in the Mehringhof today &ndash; was desperately in need of new premises. This independent college provides adults with a second chance at education. In the Seventies, it was expanding and open to new joint ventures. The result was a merger with other similar, like-minded initiatives and the decision to move into Gneisenaustra&szlig;e 2 as joint owners. Regular monthly meetings were held to approve new tenants, how much money should be spent on the buildings, and what the theme of the next Mehringhof Festival should be.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alternative, democratic, united&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the courtyard is still home to a unique mix of projects and businesses. The brick buildings provide every tenant with all the space they need. With its reputation for tolerance, the Mehringhof is a breeding ground for radical, leftist and collective ideas. Alongside the bike shop, theatre, print workshop and pub you will also find a medical centre for refugees, a Latin American newspaper, a Turkish workers&#39; association and an emergency shelter that provides the homeless with a refuge on cold winter nights.<em> Schwarze Risse</em> was originally set up as an information centre for the anti-nuclear movement, but for the last 40 years, it has been a bookshop with a distinctly political flavour.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back in 1979, no-one imagined that the organisations, shops, initiatives and projects that make up the Mehringhof would still be operating independently 40 years later. It was quite an achievement to use capital to thumb its nose at the capitalism that was threatening to destroy Kreuzberg.</p>\r\n",

They use a ladder to scale the Wall, where they are awaited by the East German authorities. This is a major PR coup for the GDR regime. They give the escapees breakfast and provide a shuttle service to the nearest border crossing, even throwing in a free train ticket.

He writes a letter to Honecker with the subject line &ldquo;A yodelling licence for the GDR&rdquo;. He says the song is a declaration of love for the German Democratic Republic. And he appeals to Honecker as one musician to another. In his youth, the East German leader had played drums in the brass band of the Rot-Front-K&auml;mpferbund, a communist paramilitary organisation. Lindenberg&rsquo;s apology is accepted and, after much negotiation, the regime invites him to play at a Free German Youth (FDJ) festival aimed at promoting world peace.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a dream come true for Lindenberg &ndash; not only has he been given permission to sing, but it also makes a statement against the arms race, at a time when the Cold War has hit new depths because of plans to deploy American missiles in Western Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Stuffed shirts in &ldquo;Eric&rsquo;s lamp shop&rdquo;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The audience is hand-picked from members of the Free German Youth movement and other party supporters. The many lights that give the Palast der Republik the nickname &ldquo;Erich&#39;s lamp shop&rdquo; illuminate a conformist sea of blue FDJ shirts. The real Lindenberg fans have been standing outside for hours, chanting &ldquo;Udo, Udo!&rdquo; Fortunately, their idol comes out of the stage door during the press conference and greets his adoring fans. They scream, clap and even hoist Lindenberg onto their shoulders. And the 650 police officers and 1,615 Stasi employees? They are overwhelmed by the wave of excitement and are struggling to get the situation under control.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But there&rsquo;s no sign of such euphoria when he returns inside to play his show. Afterwards, Lindenberg says it was like playing to stuffed animals.

French stained glass artist Gabriel Loire is assembling millions of glass fragments to create mosaic windows for the new Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. Every piece is different. He is quite literally piecing together a work of art.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s an allegory of war and the life that follows &ndash; something new can emerge from the ruins; beauty can arise out of shattered dreams. And nations at peace can achieve more than nations at war. Gabriel Loire, the French artist who is commissioned to design the windows shortly after the end of the Second World War, proves to be the perfect partner for architect Egon Eiermann. Eiermann gives the new Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church its form and face, while Loire fills in the individual features.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A pioneer of slab glass painting </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The master craftsman from Chartres has something of a Sisyphean task. Loire sets to work framing the nave and bell tower with nearly 23,000 pieces of glass mosaic. He produces sheets of glass two centimetres thick in shades of ultramarine, cobalt, indigo, azure and royal blue, ruby red, emerald green and pale yellow. Then the workshop resounds to the sound of Loire shattering the glass. In the finished window, the splintered edges of the broken glass refract the light in fascinating ways. With these glass mosaics, Loire has &lsquo;painted&rsquo; 22,790 square honeycombs, which are cast in concrete and used as a linking motif on the church, bell tower, foyer and chapel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check out the outer wall of the church and you&rsquo;ll see the individual wall panels each have 5 x 5 honeycombs, so 25 in all. Inside, there are 56 honeycombs per wall panel, and in the two-and-a-half metre space between the exterior and interior walls the windows are illuminated by spotlights. Make sure you stand in the octagonal nave, where you can immerse yourself in the play of light, the gorgeous shapes, the overwhelming blueness. The light is always different, depending on its angle and the time of day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church was consecrated on a cold December day in 1961, one week before Christmas. Since then, it has beamed a message to the world. A message of peace and the freedom to create a work of art from blue fragments. A work of art like this stained glass window.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>Thud, thud, thud. The sound of the masons&rsquo; hammers echoes across the tract of land known as the Weberwiese. They reflect the mood of optimism that is sweeping through the German Democratic Republic. Brick by brick, the workers construct the tower that will welcome its first residents in just 6 months&rsquo; time. The high-rise building on the Weberwiese is a prototype for the new socialist style of architecture.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>The entrance to the 35-metre-high building is here at Marchlewskistra&szlig;e 25. The building was designed jointly by a group of architects, including Hermann Henselmann, Hans Hipp and Richard Paulick. In the early days of the GDR, the regime was looking for a prototype that could be applied to the redevelopment of the area around Stalinallee, which was destroyed during the war and later re-named in honour of Karl Marx. This huge building project is meant to demonstrate the superiority of socialism in the class struggle with capitalism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The wedding-cake style dominates the east of the city </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rulers reject the architects&rsquo; initial designs as being too modern, sober and functional. At the next presentation, up-and-coming architect Hermann Henselmann stresses how the design has been heavily influenced by the neo-classicist master builder Karl Friedrich Schinkel, who shaped much of Prussian, imperial Berlin in the 19th century. This is enough to convince the Soviet authorities. They want buildings that reflect national and regional building traditions with typical design features. This leads to the development of an architectural style known as Socialist Classicism. This Stalinist wedding-cake style dominates the early years of the GDR. The construction work starts on 12 October 1951.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Work goes on 24/7 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The East is determined to outdo the capitalist West by building faster, higher, more impressively. The magnificent socialist building is completed in record time. Work on the construction site on the Weberwiese building site never stops; the workers build, saw and hammer around the clock. At night, 20 floodlights illuminate the site. The authorities show little consideration for the workers, expecting them to carry on in wind, rain and freezing temperatures. Countless volunteers are also involved in the project. They are part of the Nationales Aufbauwerk (National Construction Project), called into life as part of efforts to rebuild East German cities destroyed during the war. The government is ruthless about increasing productivity and introduces measures such as longer standard working hours. As a result, the construction boom on Stalinallee, the great socialist boulevard, contributes to the workers&#39; uprising of 17 June 1953 &ndash; a first cry for freedom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the building on the Weberwiese gets a warm reception. The first tenants move in on 1 May 1952, just six months after construction work began. The apartments are equipped to a high standard with fitted kitchens, telephones, central heating and even a lift &ndash; a luxury that the residents of future &ldquo;workers&#39; palaces&rdquo; certainly won&rsquo;t get to enjoy. A verse by the playwright Bertolt Brecht is carved in stone in the entrance lobby. It sums up the mood of optimism surrounding this project on the Weberwiese: <em>Friede in unserem Lande, Friede in unserer Stadt, dass sie den gut behause, der sie gebauet hat (Peace in our country, peace in our city, that they may house and protect those who built them&rdquo;)</em>. <sup>1</sup></p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>Charles Edouard Jeanneret-Gris, better known as Le Corbusier, thought it would all turn out very differently. The original plan was for Le Corbusier to build a flagship residential unit here on the edge of Grunewald &ndash; a Berlin version of his &ldquo;unit&eacute; d&rsquo;habitation&rdquo;. It would be a first for Berlin, a high-rise building with a truly modern approach to living. But the building ends up being a shadow of its original design.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>At first glance, the new Cubist building bears similarities to other designs by the famous Swiss architect, who was responsible for the French contribution to the Interbau International Building Exhibition. But by the time the topping-out ceremony is held in the summer of 1958, it&rsquo;s clear that many of Corbusier&#39;s architectural principles have fallen by the wayside. There&rsquo;s no roof garden with an open-air theatre. The room height has soared to 2.65 metres, and there&rsquo;s no sign of his usual long, horizontal windows. German building regulations and the need to save money have taken their toll.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tenement or architectural landmark?&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What remains of Corbusier&rsquo;s original ideas are his favoured concrete columns and open-plan layouts. Even before the building is finished, the local press are calling it &ldquo;Berlin&#39;s largest tenement building at Interbau&rdquo;. <sup>1 </sup>West Berlin struggles to come to terms with the colossus, which is due to contain 500 apartments. Yet the city is proud to be working with such an eminent architect, whose building is meant to be a response to the Socialist Classicism that is rampant in East Berlin. Architecture is just another front in the battle between the two political ideologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s of little concern to the first occupants of the 17-storey block. They&rsquo;re just happy to enjoy the amenities &ndash; panoramic views, a row of shops on the ground floor with a post office, hairdresser, doctors&#39; surgeries and a grocery store that even delivers to their door.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Idea or ideology?&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Le Corbusier is particularly keen to lighten the burden on housewives: &ldquo;Freed from the heavy burden of housework and childcare, families will lead happy lives in my building. There will be no quarrels between neighbours and no divorces.&rdquo; <sup>2 </sup>However, he is not a proponent of women&rsquo;s rights. He still believes a woman&rsquo;s place is in the home, and his aim is solely to relieve them of some of their household chores.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Corbusier is clear that his huge, angular buildings are not designed to be creative refuges for the individual. He is seeking solutions for the masses. That&rsquo;s why he invented the Modulor, a standard scale for a building&rsquo;s proportions. It is based on an ideal body height of 1.83 metres and a navel height of 1.13 metres. He used this to calculate the ceiling heights for this building &ndash; 2.26 metres.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact that the basic principles of his &ldquo;machines for living&rdquo; work on paper but not in practice is of little interest to Le Corbusier. The building&rsquo;s endless corridors make life more difficult, and there are no cellars. And once the grocery store moves out there&rsquo;s no need for the celebrated food hatches in each apartment. At the end of the day, urban living can&rsquo;t be designed like a factory.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>Largely for political reasons, the iconic Berlin TV Tower is constructed in the heart of the city. The East German regime wants to prove something to West Germany and the world &ndash; and it does.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>If East Germany&rsquo;s Post Services had pushed through its original plans in 1952, you would not visit the TV Tower on Alexanderplatz today, but at the M&uuml;ggelsee lake.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In part due to East Germany&rsquo;s bureaucratic and fault-prone command economy, the TV Tower project starts out like a disaster waiting to happen. The project haemorrhages vast amounts of money with never a sign of a building.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And time is pressing. In the newly-established East Germany, the available TV and radio frequencies in the &ldquo;Workers&rsquo; and Peasants&rsquo; State&rdquo; are far from ideal. The SED regime&rsquo;s Central Committee fears some GDR citizens might start listening to the free channels from West Germany, and they cannot afford to risk such &ldquo;media emigration&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Searching for a landmark site&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Appropriately enough, East Germany&rsquo;s leaders in the 1960s are looking for an impressive symbol of their socialist society&rsquo;s superiority. Ultimately, various political motives speak for the new TV Tower as an architectural demonstration of power in the centre of Berlin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Allegedly in 1964, Walter Ulbricht, then East Germany&rsquo;s head of state, personally stands in front of a model of Berlin, gestures at Alexanderplatz and says: &ldquo;Well, Comrades, you can easily see for yourself &ndash; that&rsquo;s where the tower belongs.&rdquo; Certainly, Ulbricht gives the signal for what is, at that time, an unparalleled building project in the GDR. He wants a &ldquo;socialist city crown&rdquo; for Berlin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ulbricht is looking for a distinctive landmark &ndash; and finds it in the tower&rsquo;s simple yet iconic spherical shape. This design has another advantage. Everyone seeing the tower&rsquo;s sphere recalls the famous Russian satellite Sputnik 1 &ndash; the perfect model for socialism&rsquo;s symbolic victory.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The spiralling costs are kept secret&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>From 1965, in just under four-and-a-half years, the world&rsquo;s second highest TV Tower is finished. Berlin&rsquo;s TV Tower is 365 metres high, making it also the third highest freestanding building of its day after Moscow&rsquo;s Ostzankino TV Tower and New York&rsquo;s Empire State Building. When the tower is unveiled in 1969, Walter Ulbricht is not the only one who calls it a sensation. The city&rsquo;s new landmark quickly starts to draw the crowds.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the TV Tower, East Germany creates an architectural and design masterpiece outshining anything in West Germany, which has far more economic clout. And over the following years, the GDR enjoys the success of its tower to the full. Yet the East German state is more than coy about the cost. Its citizens are not told the actual price tag of this icon of socialist planning &ndash; 132 million Marks, four times the original budget.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the Berlin Wall falls in 1989, some critical voices call for demolishing the TV Tower. Fortunately, this radical suggestion is ignored. Today, the TV Tower attracts over one million visitors a year from as many as 86 different countries. The tower has long ceased to be a symbol of the SED dictatorship in East Germany, and firmly become a symbol of a free and modern Berlin.</p>\r\n",

This high school student is one of a small group of teenagers who have discovered a gap in the border fence on the railway line. One by one, they attempt their escape by climbing onto the bridge and hiding in an alcove until the Moscow to Paris Express passes by. The train drivers are instructed to pull out of the station as fast as they can to prevent stowaways from leaping on, but just a few metres further on they have slowed again. This allows nine boys to leap onto the steps of the train and smuggle themselves across the border.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Press coverage in the West, punishment in the East&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even the Western press picks up the story and reports on the schoolboys&rsquo; escape.

Meanwhile, more than a hundred East German fans gather on the other side of the Wall to listen to songs like <em>Hymn and Life is for Living</em>. 40 of them end up under arrest.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>The Stasi and the police are on high alert. The 20th birthday of the GDR had already led to clashes when Western stations mistakenly announced that the Rolling Stones would be playing on the roof of the Axel Springer building. Thousands of East German fans flocked to the Wall. Since then, the East German regime has been sensitive about music, because it&rsquo;s impossible to stop its sound carrying over the border.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Concert for Berlin brings international stars to the city </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>June 1987, and West Berlin is celebrating the city&rsquo;s 750th anniversary with a three-day open-air festival on the lawn in front of the Reichstag. Over the course of these three days, East German fans also gather to listen to artists such as David Bowie, the Eurythmics and Genesis. On the first evening, the sound of Heroes drifts over the Wall. The song about a couple in the shadow of the Wall reaches the people who are standing on the other side &ndash; precisely where you are now.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last stretch of Unter den Linden boulevard at the entrance to Pariser Platz is where the death zone begins. Security is incredibly tight, and Pariser Platz is closed off as far as Wilhelmstra&szlig;e. But it&rsquo;s still possible to see the Reichstag. The fine square we see today was reduced to rubble during the Second World War. It was cleared after 1945 and left as wasteland. The buildings that block your view of the Reichstag were built after the Wall came down.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>From peaceful gathering to political protest </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the second evening, the Eurythmics take to the stage. The wind has changed direction and the music rings out all along the Wall. Between Pariser Platz and Charit&eacute;, people gather to listen to Annie Lennox&#39;s distinctive voice. The crowd are well-behaved, but the police are getting twitchy. They start checking papers &ndash; teenagers, students, workers, punks, rockers and pop fans alike. Then the loudspeakers blare out: &ldquo;Attention, attention! This is the Volkspolizei! Leave the area immediately and go home!&rdquo; <sup>1</sup>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What? The state is trying to ban grown adults from listening to music? This harassment creates a sense of shared identity among the diverse crowd. They will not be moved. They will resist. When the police start using violence against peaceful citizens, swinging their batons at the crowd and making arrests, the music fans morph into political protesters. They start to whistle, calling for Gorbachev and chanting: &ldquo;The Wall must go!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This evening, two years before the fall of the Wall, has a huge impact on everyone who is there. Some people apply to leave the country, while it gives others the courage to join the protests that ushered in the end of the GDR in late 1989. The Concert for Berlin may not have brought down the &ldquo;anti-fascist barrier&rdquo;, but it certainly caused it to wobble.</p>\r\n",

The Wall leaves no one cold &ndash; except the border guards, who stoically endure their class enemy&rsquo;s music as it drifts through the open windows. In the 1970s, a trip on the S-Bahn through empty ghost stations inspires Iggy Pop to write his song <em>Passenger</em>. The musicians have not only fallen for the run-down charms of this divided city, but they also love the mix of old school and high tech on offer at Hansa Studios. At its heart is the Meistersaal, a huge room with a wood-panelled ceiling, parquet floors and unique acoustics. Bowie is bowled over the moment he sets foot in it, exclaiming: &ldquo;A big hall by the Wall!&rdquo;. <sup>1 &nbsp; </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>From Heroes to <em>Achtung Baby!&nbsp; </em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1980s, a local band called the Einst&uuml;rzende Neubauten transforms the hall into an experimental cellar with instruments made from old shopping trolleys and bits of scrap metal. One day Martin Gore of Depeche Mode can be found sitting naked at the piano in the Meistersaal composing <em>Somebody</em>. This is where U2 reunite after tensions in the band to record their album <em>Achtung Baby!</em> Between 1976 and 1990 it feels like anything is possible in West Berlin.

Of course, the grand hotel bows to the wishes of the Reich&rsquo;s influential youth leader, Baldur von Schirach.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because the customer is king at the Adlon &ndash; and in the early days they were even emperors. When it opened in 1907, the hotel&rsquo;s first regular guest was none other than Wilhelm II, who preferred the luxurious Adlon to his own residence. Hardly surprising, as Lorenz Adlon had decided to create a luxury hotel for Berlin&rsquo;s high society.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>From magnificence to ruin </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Roaring Twenties, the Adlon is known around the world as a meeting place for the rich and famous, but its guest numbers plummet during the Second World War. The hotel&rsquo;s cosmopolitan flavour is not to the National Socialists&rsquo; taste &ndash; they prefer a simple stew to a sophisticated ragout. As the bombs fall on Berlin, the Adlon is miraculously spared.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So it seems like a bad joke when the hotel is burned to the ground by two Red Army soldiers who break into the wine cellar on 2 May 1945. One of them drops a burning cigarette into the wood shavings &ndash; and starts a devastating fire. All that&rsquo;s left of the magnificent building is a rear service wing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the Wall is built in 1961, the German Democratic Republic renovates the hotel and runs it until the early 1980s &ndash; but the west-facing windows are walled up. In 1964 the hotel hosts the wedding of stage designer Horst Eilers and dancer Erna Lange. But the happy couple&rsquo;s special day is marred by the police presence at the reception. And the regime only allows them to invite ten guests to this very special location &ndash; right next to the death zone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apprentices are occasionally housed in the Adlon building until it is demolished in 1984 on the orders of the SED&rsquo;s Politburo &ndash; the Adlon has had its day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the fall of the GDR, the Altstadtbau property developers erect a new building on the site of the former hotel complex, which you can now admire in all its glory.

"mainText": "<p>It&rsquo;s a hot summer&rsquo;s day in the mid-1980s. At the Dreilinden-Drewitz border crossing, known as Checkpoint Bravo to the Western Allies, traffic is backing up as it waits to transit the GDR. Although it&rsquo;s forbidden, people switch off their engines, get out of their stuffy cars and stretch their legs on the motorway.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They chat and kill time while the GDR&rsquo;s border guards carry out their stringent checks on the people in front. As the queue inches forwards, the drivers simply push their cars a couple of metres. At least they&rsquo;re protecting the environment! At communist Germany&rsquo;s border with the West, the atmosphere is as threatening as ever. But after more than 20 years, the West Berliners are used to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to imagine now, but every resident of West Berlin who wanted to go on holiday, visit another part of West Germany or enter East Germany had to endure these interminable procedures. The transit route on what is now the A115 leads to Hanover and on to Germany&rsquo;s south west. Dreilinden-Drewitz is the bottleneck through which people reach freedom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Same route, same rituals&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Travelling from West to East, you pass the lines of hitchhikers at the Dreilinden service station and head directly beneath the West&rsquo;s control bridge. A few metres further on you come to another bridge. This is where you see the divided city&rsquo;s most famous warning, painted in white letters spanning the motorway: &ldquo;You are leaving the American Sector&rdquo;. You have to slow down to 40 kph as you pass the Soviet tank monument and approach the dreaded GDR checkpoint at Drewitz. Journalist Sven Felix Kellerhoff remembers the buzz he used to feel. His father would tell him and his brother not to whinge, wriggle or crack jokes while the GDR&rsquo;s border guards were at work. <sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, little remains of this formidable checkpoint, though you can visit the old command tower if you stop in Kleinmachnow. Back then, the procedures were the same at every checkpoint.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First the occupants of the car have to hand over their passports and vehicle documents, which are transported to the actual checkpoint via a conveyor belt. You&rsquo;re left sitting in your car without a passport &ndash; in no man&rsquo;s land everyone has to feel like a nobody. You just sit there while the civilian staff, customs officers and border police all check your papers. It might take 20 minutes, or an hour, or even five hours if relations between the two Germanys have worsened. If you want to enter or leave the GDR you simply have to put up with it. If you&rsquo;re just transiting, you&rsquo;ll be dealt with relatively quickly. Once the barrier has been lifted, you embark on a monotonous journey down a hermetically sealed road until you reach the free part of Germany at the next border crossing.</p>\r\n",

Actor, singer and activist Ernst Busch is instrumental in persuading the Soviet military administration to allow the theatre and film club to open in the east of the city. The building in Luisenstra&szlig;e 18 quickly becomes something of a legend.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a magnet for celebrities, with guests including Bertolt Brecht, Erich K&auml;stner, Yves Montand, Helene Weigel, Carl Zuckmayr, Simone de Beauvoir and Sophia Loren.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Seagull flies free&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the real attraction of the club, named after Anton Chekhov&#39;s famous play, is not the star-studded guest list, but the fact that it provides a sense of freedom. The lucky ones who are granted entry find an escape from their everyday lives. Thanks to their good connections to the Soviet administration, the German artists can get hold of special rations, even during the lean post-war years. Looking back, actor Peter Sodann comments: &ldquo;Boy, did I get plenty to eat there!&rdquo;. <sup>1 &nbsp; </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before the Fall of the Wall, artists from East and West Berlin flock to The Seagull to party. Dissidents, philosophers and Stasi informers all come together under one roof &ndash; that&rsquo;s how journalist Jutta Voigt remembers it: &ldquo;The Seagull shone like a star in the darkness. Once you were allowed in, you felt uplifted, like you had ascended to a cosmopolitan heaven. One night, French fries were served at the bar and for a moment you felt like you were in Paris.&rdquo; <sup>2&nbsp; </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But its glamour fails to survive reunification. In 1990 the club closes due to lack of funds, and even an attempt to re-open it is unsuccessful. Luisenstra&szlig;e 18 is now occupied by the Berlin Representation of Saxony-Anhalt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>New Wild Ones in the old West&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s 1975, and the West has a new, exciting hotspot: the artists Salom&eacute; and Rainer Fetting have moved into an old factory building on Moritzplatz. There they create their own particular brand of art using broad brushes and expressionist radicalism in an area that is considered to be the end of the world: nothing but walls, industrial yards and decay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Fuck&rdquo; is the name of a cycle produced by Solom&eacute; during this period: naked men&#39;s bodies, sensual motifs. Things that are taboo in bourgeois post-war Germany are given free rein in Oranienstra&szlig;e 58. In 1977 they join forces with other artist friends to set up the Galerie am Moritzplatz in another old factory and gain international fame as the New Wild Ones.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After some lean early years, the breakthrough finally comes. Salom&eacute;&#39;s paintings hang in the Museum of Modern Art in New York, art dealers buy up everything the studio produces. Years later, Salom&eacute; purchases the building at 58 Oranienstra&szlig;e for himself and lives and works there to this day &ndash; even though the gallery has been closed since 1981.</p>\r\n",

"mainText": "<p>It&rsquo;s 12 June 1987, a special day for Berlin. Schools have been closed, roads blocked, the underground trains have come to a standstill. The city is celebrating its 750th birthday &ndash; but few people guess that it will be a historic day for quite different reasons. After all, the guest of honour, US President Ronald Reagan, is only dropping in for five hours. He&rsquo;s not even spending the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with visits to the Reichstag, Bellevue Palace and Tempelhof Airport, there is one other item on the itinerary for the world&rsquo;s most powerful man: Reagan is to give a speech at the Brandenburg Gate. Political observers are not expecting it be particularly significant.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Protests against the Cold War hardliner&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But some Berliners are in no mood for celebrating. They think Reagan is a Cold War hardliner who sees the Soviet Union as &ldquo;the evil Empire&rdquo;. Protests break out in Kreuzberg and demonstrators fight running battles with police.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, American and German flags are waving in front of the Brandenburg Gate. The Senate and US Embassy have assembled a sympathetic crowd for the speech. &ldquo;For the last two-and-a-half hours there&rsquo;s been what can only be described as a carnival atmosphere&rdquo;. <sup>1 </sup>This is how reporter Peter Schulz describes the scene for West-Berlin based Radio in the American Sector (RIAS).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The danger of an assassination attempt from the East forces Reagan to stand behind bullet-proof glass panels. He talks about the Olympic Games and disarmament before addressing his soon-to-be famous words to the Soviet Union&rsquo;s General Secretary: &ldquo;Mr Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr Gorbachev, tear down this wall!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A muted response&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crowd cheers &ndash; but no-one imagines Reagan&rsquo;s words will end up in the history books. Reagan&#39;s speech is covered in the Western press, but the response is muted. The Soviet news agency TASS, on the other hand, accuses the US president of delivering a &ldquo;war-mongering speech&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s what Reagan&#39;s staff had feared, and it&rsquo;s why they tried to talk the president out of including the phrase. Just a few hours before the president was due to speak, the State Department sent over a less provocative draft of the speech. But Reagan sensed the mood of the time and stood his ground.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After 1989, the president&rsquo;s words became famous all over the world. But he was not a prophet when he gave his speech two years earlier. He was simply summing up the prevailing mood in Berlin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2017, <em>SPIEGEL </em>revealed that Reagan had qualified his suggestions in talks with Moscow&#39;s Foreign Minister Shevardnadze in 1988. He admitted that it was &ldquo;perhaps unrealistic to suggest tearing down the entire wall&rdquo;. <sup>2</sup></p>\r\n",

"mainText": "<p>&nbsp;The urban planners call the buildings on the south side of Kottbusser Tor &ldquo;S&uuml;dblock&rdquo; &ndash; south block. For some, the name is synonymous with a dodgy neighbourhood, a dangerous area. When T&uuml;lin Duman, Dennis Kuhlow and Richard Stein saved this one-storey building from being turned into a gambling den, born-and bred Kreuzbergers chose this particular name. At the opening on 4 December 2010, Stein commented to a reporter from queer magazine <em>Siegess&auml;ule</em>: &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve (...) all lived here a long time and don&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s a social &#39;non-place&#39; or in any way dodgy.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you sit on the red plastic chairs outside S&uuml;dblock, you find yourself sitting in what is probably Berlin&#39;s most urban beer garden. Behind you are the Kreuzberg apartment blocks, in front the busy Kottbusser Tor traffic junction. It doesn&rsquo;t get more Kreuzberg than that. But a special kind of neighbourhood has grown up in this urban jungle over recent years. S&uuml;dblock is a place for everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Gays, lesbians, Turks </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A caf&eacute;, a stage and sometimes a social centre &ndash; S&uuml;dblock offers a diverse programme. When it was being renovated and the imitation terracotta and suspended ceilings being torn out, friends and neighbours all turned up to help. The LGBTQ community has been involved from the start, but it&rsquo;s also popular with local Turkish residents. A caf&eacute; by day and a party venue by night, it still makes sure it doesn&rsquo;t disturb the neighbours. When the glass windows of the &ldquo;aquarium&rdquo; next to S&uuml;dblock start to steam up on the inside, the beer garden is strictly off limits so that the neighbours can get their sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Problems, queers and parties </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>S&uuml;dblock also addresses social &ndash; and cosmetic &ndash; problems in Kreuzberg. The Hartzer Roller association offers advice on welfare issues every Tuesday from 1pm, while the Salon Saalam offers haircuts and fortune-telling every second Monday. It also hosts regular events and discussions on local issues. And of course it wouldn&rsquo;t be Kreuzberg without all kinds of party events, such as the Flittchenbar, Dance-Karaoke and Queer Arabeske. Not to mention serving breakfast, lunch and cake all day long. For the people of Kreuzberg, S&uuml;dblock is a home from home, a place where they can simply be themselves. Being queer &ndash; deviating from the norm &ndash; is normal here.</p>\r\n",

These souvenir hunters, tourists, vendors and GDR opponents take away parts of the Berlin Wall bit by bit. The fa&ccedil;ade of this once insurmountable &ldquo;protective wall&rdquo; starts to crumble.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>The West Berlin police loudspeakers boom out loud and clear: &ldquo;Stop chipping away at the Wall!&rdquo; But it takes more than that to stop the Wallpeckers. As they knock pieces off the concrete Wall, they create a wall of sound never heard before in Berlin &ndash; hammering, clanging, banging, and cracking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyone who hears this &ldquo;historic noise&rdquo; live can never forget it &ndash; just like Michael Glaser, working for East Germany&rsquo;s only record label VEB Deutsche Schallplatten. In his view, the noise of these days is &ldquo;an incredibly great sound&rdquo;. <sup>1 </sup>And while the entire world watches events in Berlin spellbound, Glaser and his colleague Horst Langheinrich captures them acoustically &ndash; by hanging microphones out of their office window. Later, their recordings are released as the CD <em>Mauerspechte - The Wall-Peckers </em>&ndash;&nbsp; the 100% authentic sound of the Peaceful Revolution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The fa&ccedil;ade crumbles&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even before these dramatic events, there are solo actions attacking the Wall by, for example, John Runnings, a committed freethinker and peace campaigner. In 1986, Runnings climbs the Wall at Potsdamer Platz and, using a sledgehammer, knocks off some of the smooth pipe on top &ndash; an action later leading him to be dubbed &ldquo;Father of all Wallpeckers&rdquo;. In the night of 9 November 1989, the Berlin Wall at the Brandenburg Gate is again conquered &ndash; this time by euphoric crowds attacking it with hammers or even their bare hands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few days later the first souvenir hunters arrive, all keen to scavenge a piece of this world-famous concrete wall. In no time at all, the small group of people carefully knocking pieces off the Wall swells to hundreds. It becomes a kind of popular sport. Suddenly, the market for fragments of the Wall booms, especially for pieces showing traces of the original graffiti. In many cases, though, the colour is actually sprayed on afterwards &ndash; without colour, the fragments just look like any lump of concrete.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Where is the wall? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Work officially starts on demolishing what the GDR called the &ldquo;anti-fascist protective wall&rdquo; in June 1990. The Wall dividing Berlin for over 28 years is quickly removed. In autumn 1990, the most frequent question tourists ask is: &ldquo;Where is the Wall?&rdquo; The answer today is easy &ndash; bits of it can be found scattered around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1989, Hagen Koch is responsible for organising the demolishing of the Wall. He knows that selected pieces end up abroad as memorials, prize trophies, advertising gifts, art objects or as gestures of thanks &ndash; among the most famous recipients, for example, Ronald Reagan, Bill Gates and the Vatican. You can also find small original parts of the Wall in the Berlin Tourist Info Centres at Brandenburg Gate, the Central Station, the Europa-Center and the Hotel Park Inn by Radisson Berlin Alexanderplatz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And if you find yourself in front of a surviving part of the Wall, for instance at the East Side Gallery, just remember: Chipping pieces off it is strictly prohibited!</p>\r\n",

At the time, he has no idea that his sketches will produce a Berlin icon.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p><strong>A socialist-style redesign </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the late Sixties, Alexanderplatz (Alex) is given a complete overhaul. Like Moscow&rsquo;s Red Square, it is to be Berlin&rsquo;s central square for staging major events &ndash; such as the GDR&rsquo;s fast-approaching 20th anniversary. The icing on the cake is provided by a competition to build a new Urania column &ndash; the original was an advertising column with a clock, built by the Urania watch factory.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The designer Erich John is one of 20 entrants in the competition. The final selection takes place in Monbijoupark in Berlin-Mitte. When John is called forward, he presents his idea to the jury. &ldquo;They were bowled over&rdquo;, <sup>1 </sup>he recounts in an interview in 2010.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Erich John had been an industrial designer for many years. Between 1955 and 1992 he designed all kinds of products, from radio receivers to shavers, microscopes to drills. For Alex, he designed a symbol of cosmopolitanism and technological progress: the World Clock.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John describes how it works: &ldquo;My design replaces the hour hand with an hour ring that moves the hours (...) through the 24 time zones. The time zone panels are engraved with the names of more than 150 cities around the world. The planetary system that circles above it references how time is linked to what is happening in space, but here (...) it acts as a minute hand. One turn equals one minute.&rdquo; <sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A cosmopolitan symbol in the GDR </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It sounds complicated, but it causes quite a stir among the jury. John wins the competition, but deadlines are tight, and materials are hard to come by in the GDR. Special permits are needed, and the <em>Feierabendbrigaden </em>are called in &ndash; bands of workers who work for cash-in-hand alongside their official jobs. The building work is hampered by bad weather and lack of resources. But nine months later, the 16-tonne World Clock is finished &ndash; just in time for the GDR&rsquo;s 20th birthday. It officially opens on 30 September 1969.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It survives the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification and is listed as a historical monument in 2015. It still works perfectly. When you admire the iconic postcard motif on Alexanderplatz, you&rsquo;d be justified in asking why a state that deprived citizens of their freedom wanted a cosmopolitan symbol? It was certainly a paradox during the GDR regime, but today it is in tune with the times. &ldquo;I never expected it to be such a hit&rdquo;, <sup>3 </sup>says John.</p>\r\n",

They are written on the new building designed by architect Siza Vieira. Hello, sadness! No-one knows how the graffiti got there or who painted it. But many people agree with the sentiment when they see the building&rsquo;s dismal fa&ccedil;ade and monotonous array of windows. Ever since the 1980s, Berlin&rsquo;s graffiti has been a form of communication between the city and its people. Now another example has joined its ranks.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p><strong>Walls tell stories&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The graffiti movement emerges in the US in the late Seventies. It soon spills over to Europe, accompanied by a wave of hip-hop culture and punk music. West Berlin is ready to soak it up. The city&rsquo;s divided state means everything is politicised, including art. West Berlin offers artists plenty of scope.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many buildings have been reduced to rubble during the Second World War, leaving empty spaces punctuated by immense, blank firewalls. These were constructed to protect houses from the spread of flames in the event of fire, but now they provide perfect empty canvases. Graffiti artists use them to tell their stories, big and small, in images and letters. Monotonous facades such as the building by Siza Vieira become a screen for projecting political news.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kreuzberg district is a major draw, not only for its many firewalls, but because it is home to the biggest canvas in the world &ndash; the west side of the Wall. In 1976 the GDR border guards begin building a new type of wall. Made of gleaming white slabs, it is an irresistible invitation to artists. They flock to Berlin from far and wide to leave their comments on local and world politics on the Wall.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1986, the Checkpoint Charlie Museum invites top American street artist Keith Haring to come to Berlin. He is given free rein on a hundred-metre section of the Wall, where he paints his vision of a united Germany in black, red and gold.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Street art and graffiti can also be found in East Berlin. In the district of Marzahn, an artist from Nicaragua is allowed to paint the facades of East Berlin&rsquo;s typical concrete apartment blocks, but the authorities keep him on a tight rein. From time to time, illegal murals also appear around East Berlin, and as the regime crumbles, the Wall is daubed with slogans such as &ldquo;Down with the wall of shame&rdquo; and &ldquo;Freedom &ndash; no more SED lies&rdquo;. This is viewed as subversive activity and punished accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The start of a new era&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fall of the Wall in 1989 heralds a new era for street art and graffiti. Now it&rsquo;s on a roll in East and West alike. Artists from all over the world are drawn to Berlin by events such as the Mural Festival. Today, Berlin is considered the European capital of street art and graffiti.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>The objectives of the opposition movements are clear: dissolving the Stasi, free elections and a democratic constitution for East Germany. They finally succeed in sitting around a table with the Communist state organisations &ndash; but are overtaken by the speed of events.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>On 7 December 1989, a dense crowd of journalists and camera teams gathers on the pavement just where you are standing now. Thirty-three men and women push their way through the media crowds, heading for the Dietrich Bonhoeffer House, at that time the community centre of the Protestant Moravian Church. Once in the building, they take their seats in the assembly hall for the first session of the Central Round Table of the GDR. In fact, though, the tables are arranged in a square.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a series of demonstrations and protest actions, the popular citizens&rsquo; movements finally succeed in meeting GDR state representatives for negotiations as equals. The two sides have an equal number of delegates &ndash; 15 from the opposition movements, and 15 from the GDR&rsquo;s still ruling Socialist Unity Party along with its block parties. Three church representatives are present to moderate the meeting and keep it on track. Under the large decorative star for the Advent season, the representatives of the people put their demands on the table.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The end of the Stasi </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The grassroots representatives know exactly what they want to achieve: &ldquo;The participants in the Round Table are meeting out of their profound concern for our crisis-ridden country, for its independence, and its long-term development.&rdquo; Their declared goal is to prepare for free and democratic elections &ndash; and ensure the dissolution of the Ministry for State Security with immediate effect. But that&rsquo;s a demand which the leaders of the Socialist Unity Party (SED) and the Politburo find hard to swallow.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through emissaries Gregor Gysi and Wolfgang Berghofer, the new Communist premier Hans Modrow proposes that the Round Table should tackle the task of founding a new agency for internal security &ndash; to protect against fascist tendencies. But the opposition members soon expose the suggestion for what it is &ndash; just keeping the old Stasi in a new guise. Representatives of the New Forum, one of East Germany&rsquo;s most influential grassroots movements, discuss the topic with a directness that unsettles the church officials presiding over the meeting. At this time, though, they are not yet aware of the extent of Stasi surveillance. This conflict come to a head in further demonstrations, and Modrow can only defuse the situation by promising to abandon his plan of setting up a new intelligence agency.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fast forward to free elections&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The representatives of the GDR opposition groups at the Central Round Table meetings are unable to achieve their top priority. Inspired by the desire to pave the way for their country into democracy and freedom, they envision drafting a new constitution. Although work begins on the draft, it remains incomplete. With the first free elections to the Volkskammer (People&rsquo;s Chamber) brought forward to 18 March 1990, the Round Table, which is not an elected body, becomes superfluous. What happens to the country afterwards is then in the hands of the first and only freely elected government of the GDR, the German Democratic Republic.</p>\r\n",

"mainText": "<p>By the time 20 young people move into the former factory complex, the building has already had a chequered history. It&rsquo;s been a stonemason&#39;s workshop, a chocolate factory, a Hitler Youth base, a horse stables, a commodities warehouse and finally a derelict building. Toilets and bathrooms? Nope. Heating that works? Not really.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Summer of anarchy&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The building might be crumbling, but it still seems like a good place to set up a squat. After all, it&rsquo;s the brief summer of anarchy. Everything is up for grabs because the authorities and East Germany&rsquo;s Volkspolizei are no longer bothered about squats, and West Berlin&rsquo;s police and politicians will only take over responsibility once the Unification Treaty has been signed. It&rsquo;s still East Berlin, but the power vacuum means freedom is breaking out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The empty properties also exercise their charm on West Berliners and soon a diverse mix of people are bringing the former chocolate factory back to life. Artists flock there to open studios and workshops, theatres and clubs. The Schoko-Laden quickly becomes the first alternative cultural centre. It&rsquo;s a place where people can live and work together far removed from the day-to-day reality of exploitation and political borders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Cooperation is the key&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The squatters are keen to find a way to make their centre work. They set up a culture and housing association known as Schokoladen e.V. While some shared housing projects are forcibly shut down, the Schokoladen has better luck. Its residents manage to convert the squat into legal tenancies, while still retaining a degree of self-determination. Later on, they successfully fend off attempts to evict them. The unique atmosphere of this non-commercial microcosm provides a rich breeding ground for unusual ideas. There&rsquo;s room for everything and everyone, from cello punk to the <em>Club of</em> <em>Polish Losers</em>.</p>\r\n",

"mainText": "<p>It is early evening on 15 January 1990. Pastor and civil rights activist Martin Montag from Thuringia can hardly believe what is happening. He is standing at the Stasi headquarters in Berlin-Lichtenberg, trying to persuade demonstrators not to storm the Ministry of State Security.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How come a clergyman who is opposed to the regime is attempting to protect East Germany&rsquo;s hated secret police from an angry mob?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This unlikely situation has come about because, all day long, the Ministry has been haunted by its political opponents. At midday on 15 January 1990, civil rights groups led by Martin Montag &ldquo;occupied&rdquo; the building during a peaceful visit to negotiate the dissolution of this organisation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Protesters bring radical change&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this point, nobody imagines that a public demonstration which, by chance, has been planned for the same day will radically alter the course of events.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A small crowd is expected, but in facts tens of thousands of East German citizens show up, all bursting with anger and indignation about being spied upon for the last 40 years. They force their way into the once impenetrable Stasi headquarters, opening up the gates from the inside. Overwhelmed, the police can do nothing to hold back the angry mob. Even Martin Montag has to stand back.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Go through the main gate and enter the complex on Normannenstra&szlig;e. Take a left &ndash; towards Building 18 &ndash; and you are following the exact route taken by those protesters 28 years ago. Today it&rsquo;s very peaceful, but at that time your ears would have been ringing. Thousands of voices chanting &ldquo;Down with the Stasi!&rdquo;. A placard depicting Erich Honecker dressed as a convict. Glass flying around as windows are shattered.&nbsp; But for some protesters, their sense of triumph at storming the building mingles with a sense of unease. What if they are attacked by the Stasi?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Prime Minister&rsquo;s appeals for calm fall on deaf ears&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But where are all the Stasi agents? It seems they have given up their supposedly impenetrable fortress without a fight. But that&rsquo;s hardly surprising, as they had already begun shredding files back in October 1989.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rioters soon realise there&rsquo;s nothing to find. In their fury they break windows, smash office equipment, ransack a hair salon, plunder a storeroom and refuse to be placated by the words of Prime Minister Hans Modrow, who has rushed to the scene.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The demonstrators rampage unhindered around Building 18, but in fact they marched straight past the Stasi&rsquo;s true centre of power right at the start.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But one thing is clear &ndash; on the evening of 15 January 1990 the people of East Germany liberated themselves from the hated secret police. However, their victory was largely symbolic, as even the secret service had grounds for feeling they had come out on top. Ultimately, the people&rsquo;s rage only led to modest amounts of damage to an ancillary building. And the protesters failed to get their hands on a single important file.</p>\r\n",

The techno DJ started the open-air event in 1989 under the motto peace, joy and pancakes. In an interview he comments: &ldquo;The first Love Parade gave me goose bumps for five hours. We walked up the Ku&#39;damm with 150 people, the police in front and behind. On the way back, we blocked an intersection and danced in the street.&rdquo; <sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within 10 years, this small parade has turned into a major event. Every year, the Kurf&uuml;rstendamm disappears beneath a sea of bodies dancing to the techno beat. Where you are walking today is where ravers came to party at the Love Parade &ndash; until 1995.

But its founder, Dr Motte, is feeling disillusioned with the peace parade because it&rsquo;s becoming too mainstream, too commercial. And it has a bad image because of blatant drug dealing, the rubbish left in the Tiergarten, and the harassment of local residents.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than a million ravers descend on Berlin for the tenth anniversary of the Love Parade, but numbers start to decline in the 2000s.

The Love Parade moves from Berlin to the cities of the Ruhr area, until disaster strikes in 2010. At the Love Parade in Duisburg, mass panic breaks out in a narrow tunnel. 21 people are killed and hundreds are badly injured. It spells the end of the legendary techno parade.</p>\r\n",

The building has been cleared for demolition, so it&rsquo;s in urgent need of renovation. But that costs money. Unless the squatters legally occupy the building, it will be difficult to get a loan.

They come along to admire and photograph the art.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The art scene is worried that the art could end up playing second fiddle to tourism. But in the months and years that follow, lots of German and international artists move to the centre to live and work. They include Dutch photographer Tim Roeloffs, Chilean theatre producer Paulo San Martin, German painter Thomas &ldquo;Tombo&rdquo; Sojka and director Jochen Sandig. But the creative project with its tolerant, liberal attitudes has its enemies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Attacks from the right &ndash; and from within </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Skinheads regularly turn up to trash the arts centre. Sometimes they come with baseball bats, sometimes with iron bars, but always with blind hatred. In June 1990 they attack with Molotov cocktails. As Thomas Sojka runs to put out the fire on the ground floor he is hit by a second Molotov cocktail. His clothes go up in flames and he&rsquo;s lucky to survive the attack. After six weeks in hospital he returns to the Tacheles centre to find life is going on as before, but the atmosphere is changing. Arguments break out regularly and in the end there&rsquo;s only one loser: the building itself. The artists vacate the premises in 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can visit one of the last of the free art centres at Veteranenstra&szlig;e 21.

"mainText": "<p><em>Long live Mainzer Stra&szlig;e! </em>That&rsquo;s the message on the orange container in the squatters&rsquo; barricades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the spring of 1990, this has been the home of East and West Berliners alike, a diverse group of antifascists, non-conformists, punks, gays and artists. But they are all united by their desire for space and freedom, whether it&rsquo;s room for new countercultures or empty places to live. There is no shortage of opportunities, because East Berlin is still a power vacuum. The West German police don&rsquo;t feel they are responsible for it, and East Germany&rsquo;s Volkspolizei no longer have an incentive to get their fingers burned. As far as the police are concerned, East Berlin doesn&rsquo;t exist.&nbsp; The fall of the Wall also means that large numbers of old buildings are standing empty, and it&rsquo;s unclear who owns them. 200 are taken over by squatters.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The occupation of the first ten houses in Mainzer Stra&szlig;e leads to the emergence of an alternative community. There are art studios, gay bars, theatres, cheap food at the &ldquo;Volxk&uuml;che&rdquo; (people&rsquo;s kitchen), playgrounds and junk shops. Then there&rsquo;s the gay house, the lesbian and women&rsquo;s house, and lots of mixed apartment buildings. But there are people who hate these free-wheeling lifestyles. The squatters face regular attacks from neo-fascists.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The &ldquo;Berlin Line&rdquo; policy reaches the East&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As of 24 July 1990, the &ldquo;Berlin Line&rdquo; policy also applies in the East, meaning that new squats can be cleared within 24 hours. Although the Mainzer Stra&szlig;e squats are all old buildings, on 12 November it becomes clear that the Senate is not prepared to make an exception. An armoured car is sent in to flatten the squatters&rsquo; blockades, the police spray tear gas, and a water cannon is turned on the buildings. The squatters respond with a hail of stones, forcing the police to retreat. The next day is filled with demonstrations against police brutality. The street plenum, which is jointly responsible for Mainzer Stra&szlig;e, repeatedly announces its willingness to negotiate and promises the immediate dismantling of the barricades. But all attempts to reach someone in the Senate are doomed to failure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>14 November 1990, 3.45 am &ndash; it all kicks off&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A cellar is in flames. Pure coincidence? Or is it a deliberate attack, meaning some of the barricades have to be moved to make way for the fire brigade? Whatever the cause, once the fire brigade has left the scene, the police get heavy handed. At 6am they begin a major offensive involving 3,000 policemen, 10 water cannons and several armoured cars. They are met with Molotov cocktails and stones being hurled from the house roofs. The riot police attempt to take control of the roofs by shooting rubber bullets and gas grenades from helicopters. It&rsquo;s a miracle that no-one falls off. But the people of Mainzer Stra&szlig;e realise the only way to break the spiralling violence is to clear out. Later, Mayor Walter Momper justifies the police crackdown by saying the squatters were &ldquo;prepared to kill&rdquo;. <sup>1 </sup>But he fails to mention the massive police brutality.</p>\r\n",

This is how 68 Rosenthaler Stra&szlig;e was recently described in an estate agent&rsquo;s advert &ndash; a far cry from how the building looked in 1990. At that time it was surrounded by rubble with empty lots on either side. Yet the place was alive and kicking as the bass-heavy beats of a punk band boomed out into the street.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>The GDR is not a good place to be a punk. Pogoing and mohicans don&rsquo;t exactly fit in with the political system. But when the Wall comes down, everything changes. New spaces are suddenly opening up because so many buildings have been abandoned. 68 Rosenthaler Stra&szlig;e is just one of many forgotten properties in East Berlin. On 17 January 1990 the first squatters move into the dilapidated building. The cellar ceiling seems to be on the verge of collapse, so the squatters simply rip it out. This involves shifting bucket after bucket of rubble &ndash; which is how the building gets its new name: the Eimer, the German word for bucket.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The building soon fills up. More and more squatters are discovering that East Berlin is largely operating outside of the law. West Berlin&rsquo;s police don&rsquo;t feel they are responsible, and East Germany&rsquo;s Volkspolizei no longer feel an incentive to get their fingers burned. This power vacuum provides a hotbed for East Berlin&rsquo;s punk movement, and artists also start moving in from the West.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alternative versus mainstream&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The basement with its open cellar soon becomes a leading underground club. It attracts two types of people &ndash; those who are looking for somewhere to try out new ideas, and those who have ideas for making money out of them. East Berlin bands like Freygang, DieFirma, Ich-Funktion and Teutonic Death Fun Core and legendary punks such as Speiche play here and declare war on commercialism. Cigarette machines? Forget it. Slot machines? Rip-off. Here you get alternative music and beer for next to nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Politics and pogoing are poor bedfellows&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Eimer manages to remain generally apolitical, despite the fact that the squatter scene is very left-wing. &ldquo;Freedom is more than being left-wing&rdquo; says one of the first squatters to move in. <sup>1 </sup>That&rsquo;s what the Eimer is all about &ndash; freedom from the mainstream, freedom from convention, being open to new things. When the occupants discover that two members of the band Freygang were once Stasi informants, they are immediately banished from the building. You don&rsquo;t mess with the Eimer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, their tenacity is no match for the authorities when the building is raided by trade licensing officers in 2001. They claim that the old electric cables constitute a major fire hazard, and the last squat in East Berlin is shut down. Despite setting up a &ldquo;Save the Eimer&rdquo; campaign, the residents are forced to leave. The building is renovated and converted into a shop and apartments.</p>\r\n",

When the Wall comes down, the city is left in limbo. The GDR&rsquo;s laws no longer apply, and no new rules have been made. Squatters move into empty buildings, the East German police are at a loss and simply ignored, illegal clubs spring up. A breath of anarchy is blowing through the formerly divided city.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This chaotic situation combines with the euphoria of Berlin&rsquo;s reunited citizens. All over the city, they are celebrating their new-found freedom: in former factories and overground bunkers, on car park roofs, in abandoned cellars. Many of the new clubs are named after their previous function, and suddenly E-Werk, Tresor, and Bunker are throbbing to one beat &ndash; techno. It&rsquo;s the soundtrack to the fall of the Wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&ldquo;Like a good wine, a good club gets better with age&rdquo; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The techno clubs of the Nineties attract clubbers from all over the world. Dimitri Hegemann plays a key role in this, flying in top international DJs like Jeff Mills and Juan Atkins. Tresor still exists today. In an interview in 2016, Hegemann suggests than an unusual location is the key to lasting success: &ldquo;The club wouldn&rsquo;t have been as popular if we hadn&rsquo;t set it up in its old location, that rusting vault under the former Wertheim building on Leipziger Platz.&rdquo; <sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>He adds that a good club is like good wine &ndash; it gets better with age. When the former Wertheim department store is demolished in 2007, Tresor moves to K&ouml;penicker Strasse. But its success continues. Every weekend, people still flock to Berlin to party in Hegemann&#39;s Tresor &ndash; surrounded by barred windows and safety deposit boxes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

It is the very building where the Politburo met every week at 10am sharp.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Honecker would open the meeting, then decisions would be made about everything from economic plans to car prices, building projects and parades. The Politburo wields unlimited power and ministers in the elected government are bound by its directives.

Granting greater freedom to travel is an admission that the regime has been unable to gain the lasting loyalty of its citizens.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>An accidental bombshell </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Italian journalist Riccardo Ehrmann finally asks about the initial set of travel regulations, which were still full of restrictions, and which had led to massive protests a few days earlier: &ldquo;Wasn&#39;t it a mistake for you to publish these draft travel regulations on Monday?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the cue for Schabowski to give them the good news. But he is shuffling his notes. Has he lost his nerve? He decides to read out the text of the resolution from the Council of Ministers and ends with the words: &ldquo;Permanent emigration may take place via all GDR border crossing points to the Federal Republic of Germany or to Berlin (West)...&rdquo; The document doesn&rsquo;t appear to specify when the regulations come into effect. When asked about it, he adds with a touch of irritation: &ldquo;As far as I know... effective immediately, without delay...&rdquo;. <sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s only later that Schabowski realises his words have opened up the border. The document is still being circulated when he makes his announcement &ndash; and none of the border guards know anything about it. &ldquo;Effective immediately&rdquo; should have been &ldquo;effective tomorrow&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that&rsquo;s of little concern to the people who hear the news on the <em>Aktuelle Kamera </em>newscast. Hundreds make their way to the border and demand that the barriers be opened. The situation on Bornholmer Strasse is escalating because the border guards have no specific orders. Fortunately, they exercise restraint and no shots are fired. People can now cross into West Berlin.</p>\r\n",

But on 15 February 2008 a convoy of limousines pulls up outside its doors. A small blonde woman gets out and heads into the bar.

"mainText": "<p><strong>A meeting place for non-conformists </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaffee Burger has cult status &ndash; and a fascinating history. The Burger, as it&rsquo;s known, is more than just a caf&eacute; and bar. It&#39;s a regular haunt of dissidents. It&rsquo;s where artists and creatives gather to chew the fat. There&rsquo;s been a pub on this spot since the late 19th century. The Burger family took it over in 1936 and put their name on the outside of the building. They and their guests are destined to live through turbulent times, including two dictatorships.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the GDR regime, Kaffee Burger is a hotspot of East Berlin&#39;s cultural scene. It&rsquo;s close to the Volksb&uuml;hne, the hub of contemporary theatre. Regular visitors to the bar include the writer Thomas Brasch, playwright Heiner M&uuml;ller, actress Katharina Thalbach and songwriter Bettina Wegner, along with countless other free-thinking GDR citizens and people who are keen to leave the country. Of course the Stasi are not too happy about this. It thinks East Berlin&rsquo;s bohemian crowd are enjoying too much freedom, so it moves into the building&rsquo;s empty first floor to keep a close eye on the Burger family and their guests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>From cafe to disco </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kaffee Burger survives the upheavals of German reunification and it&rsquo;s business as usual. The Burgers finally decide to retire in 1999. The new owners are keen to maintain the venue&rsquo;s heritage and atmosphere and put on cultural events. The Verbrecher publishing house brings its authors here as part of the<em> Reformb&uuml;hne Heim &amp; Welt </em>programme of public readings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It attracts writers such as Jakob Hein, Ahne and Wladimir Kaminer. In 2000, Kaminer, a star of the Berlin literary scene, starts hosting a hip new event &ndash; the Russian Disco. People are soon queueing around the block to get in. Kaminer was born in Moscow in 1967 and has lived in Prenzlauer Berg since 1990. His short stories describe life as a Russian immigrant in Berlin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every so often, someone staggers out of Kaffee Burger to get a breath of fresh air. Inside it&rsquo;s hot, sweaty, packed to the rafters. There may not be much fresh air but there&rsquo;s no shortage of vodka, Russian punk and Balkan beats. Kaffee Burger changed hands in 2015 but it still provides a vibrant mix of culture and music. Nowadays it just attracts a younger crowd.</p>\r\n",

From the central reservation on the Mehringdamm, on the corner of Yorckstra&szlig;e, a staircase leads down to a place that is a combination of gallery, bar and club. Behind the entrance to the first room there&rsquo;s a toilet. Until a few years ago, this was the site of a public toilet, a &ldquo;cottage&rdquo; &ndash; a place where gay men meet for sex. Under the National Socialists, these places offered gay men a modicum of safety and freedom. During the 1980s, gay men in West Berlin also had to resort to cottaging because intercourse between men was still illegal. The cottages became vital elements of homosexual subculture.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the toilet in the centre of Kreuzberg is very dilapidated. The council is on the verge of knocking it down, but it is rescued by its current operators, Flint Neiber and S&ouml;ren van Laak. The young men spend three years trying to get official approval for their plans, never giving up hope until the tenancy agreement is finally in their hands. Then they have a lot of work to do. They have to dry out the rooms, dispose of the waste and connect the water, gas and electricity. Ventilation is vital in underground rooms like these.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The club&rsquo;s owners deliberately make few changes to the fabric of the building and preserve most of the 1980s graffiti. The original tiles and condom machine in the toilets give the place its special charm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Space for creative freedom </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We make the rooms available to artists. They can exhibit their works there, <sup>1 </sup>&rdquo; says one of the owners. Yet again, they have demonstrated how a little creativity can bring Berlin&rsquo;s abandoned places back to life. Members of Berlin&rsquo;s subculture have always had to fight for their freedom to create.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The club celebrates its official opening in January 2018. An artist marks the occasion with an exhibition of photos about the location and cottaging in Berlin entitled Fenster zum Klo (<em>Window on the toilet</em>). After its first six months, the club is taking a summer break. Time to let some air in.</p>\r\n",

Coloured lights are flickering from the high windows. People go quiet as they shuffle closer to the door. A muffled bass beat echoes out of the building. Now you&#39;re at the door.

When you step inside the temple of techno, be careful what you do with your phone. You&rsquo;re not supposed to be in touch with the outside world, and photography is strictly forbidden. At Berghain, discretion is the key.&nbsp;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s precisely why Berghain is known as a place of freedom. It&rsquo;s not a place for show-offs. Nobody gets preferential treatment because they&#39;re a celebrity. If you get in, you&rsquo;ve joined the clubbing community. It&rsquo;s tolerant. Pretty much anything goes. When you step inside Berghain you&rsquo;re entering a world of intoxication, abandon and ecstasy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The best club in the world </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2004 the club moved into a former power plant in Friedrichshain. The owners commissioned a firm of designers to strip out and redesign the massive building, which once supplied Stalinallee with power. It gets its name from Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain, the two districts that flank the building &ndash; Berg-Hain. In 2009, the British <em>DJ Magazine</em> voted Berghain the best club in the world. International DJs are falling over themselves to get booked. Every weekend, thousands of clubbers hope the bouncers will grace them with their favour.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you&rsquo;ve gone through bag check and body check, go up the huge steel staircase. The bass blasts from the speakers in the vast room. There&#39;s a corridor to one side. The darker it gets, the more it stinks. Urine or semen? You&rsquo;re approaching the darkroom. Go back. There are more hidden corners and dark corridors. You go up a few steps and are in the Panorama Bar. People are swaying trance-like to the beat, a faint smile on their lips. At sunrise, the huge blinds are opened slightly for a few seconds. Rays of sunlight penetrate the interior. The crowd goes crazy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s 9.30 in the morning. Outside, people are still joining the queue. You can come back later &ndash; the club stays open till Monday morning. Clubbing in Berlin has no limits!</p>\r\n",

Its silver-coloured wings wiggle slightly, as if waving goodbye. Dubbed a Candy Bomber by locals, the plane evokes the historic Berlin Air Lift. The Douglas DC-3 flies off into the sky over Berlin &ndash; the last aircraft to take off from Tempelhof Airport. On this day, the airport is officially decommissioned &ndash; and after a flight lasting just a few minutes, the Candy Bomber lands at Sch&ouml;nefeld Airport.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p><strong>The gateway to the free world </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Cold War, Tempelhof Airport stands as a guarantor of freedom. In 1948, the Soviet army seals off the sectors of Berlin under the Western Allies. With only the air route open, the Allies launch an air lift through Tempelhof Airport. As the Candy Bombers bring in relief supplies for West Berlin&rsquo;s residents, Tempelhof Airport becomes the &ldquo;gateway to the world&rdquo;. It develops into an inner-city transport hub, a place where many travellers would take off and land in years to come. Tempelhof Airport is finally closed on 30 October 2008 &ndash; fuelling a protracted debate on what Berlin should to do with the site. The promising project of an urban park is called Tempelhofer Freiheit &ndash; &ldquo;Tempelhof Freedom&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>An urban park for all Berlin </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 8 May 2010, the new park opens. It is an unforgettable experience &ndash; just as it still is today when you step onto the Tempelhofer Feld, as the park is now called. Initially, ten access routes lead into this vast site &ndash; one of the world&rsquo;s largest open free spaces in any inner city. The park&rsquo;s size is awesome &ndash; 300 hectares, enough space for around 420 football pitches. Or put another way &ndash; seven times as large as the Vatican City. Tempelhofer Feld park is open for all. Here (almost) everything is allowed &ndash; from skating to strolling, urban gardening, picnicking, chilling, kite surfing, bird watching and much more. Take a look around. The leisure activities are supplemented by a community garden, a bicycle repair shop, and a Theater der Welten theatre project. Today, the striking airport buildings, now with heritage status, regularly host major trade fairs and music events.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2014, a referendum is held on the park&rsquo;s future use. The Berlin Senate wants to allow perimeter developments with apartments, a library and commercial real estate. Many Berlin residents see this as the beginning of the end of their freedom on the spreading Tempelhofer Freiheit park. The referendum leaves no doubt. The Berliners vote overwhelmingly to preserve the entire Tempelhof Feld park &ndash; their playground and experimental ground. What the future holds for this vast free space depends on the courage and inventiveness of Berlin&rsquo;s policymakers.</p>\r\n",

The artist Se&ntilde;or Schnu collected 200 kilos of moss from a military training area and stuck it to the walls with yoghurt. The day after the exhibition opened, the smell started to permeate the building. Now it has to be aired several times a day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Se&ntilde;or Schnu is one of 165 artists working in this five-storey building. The Haus is a truly multi-sensory project. The motor of a kebab skewer buzzes as it rotates a colourful metal sculpture. A dark tunnel full of fabric vines leads to a ghostly magic forest with neon-coloured leaves and fantasy figures. The miles of black and white tape that create a jagged pattern in the corridor make you feel quite dizzy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every imaginable kind of urban art has come together here, including paintings and sculptures, graffiti and installations. The artists have unlimited scope.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Freedom through transience </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A property developer kicked off the project when he asked Dixon, a group of street artists, to use the building. They invited their &ldquo;homies&rdquo; &ndash; fellow artists from all over the world &ndash; to come and join in. Before it was demolished, the office block was turned into a temporary gallery. This kind of transient use is typical of Berlin since its reunification.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But this kind of space for artists is becoming increasingly scarce, which makes it all the more important for artists and property developers to work together at <em>The Haus</em>. The project opens its doors for two months. Admission is free, but visitor numbers are limited. Only 199 visitors are allowed into the building at one time. In the end, 78,000 visitors pass through its doors &ndash; a huge success for the initiators and artists.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visitors are not allowed to take photos of the artworks. The idea is that they should focus on the art, immerse themselves in the transience of the moment, and allow the images to become etched in their memory. At the end of the exhibition, the art is destroyed. By its very nature, street art is transient, and the same goes for <em>The Haus</em>.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>4 May 2018. Ben Wagin is overjoyed as he watches a group of young artists standing on scaffolding recreating his mural <em>Weltbaum (World Tree)</em>. They are painting it on the end of a building in Lehrter Stra&szlig;e in Berlin&rsquo;s Moabit district. The longest branch reaches 20 metres towards the sky. The artists are relocating one of Berlin&#39;s most famous pieces of graffiti. The original is three kilometres away and about to disappear behind a new building. Street art is ephemeral. But it&rsquo;s also spontaneous and flexible.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>The performance artist Ben Wagin was born Bernhard Wargin in 1930 and has lived in Berlin since 1957. His artistic career began with the construction of the Wall. He began planting trees all over the city and became known as the &ldquo;godfather of trees&rdquo;. His trees can be found in front of ministries, theatres and museums, but his art always has a political flavour.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A pioneer of the modern street art scene </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On 9 November 1990, Wagin creates an installation called <em>The Parliament of Trees </em>on the former border strip. He dedicates the trees to the victims of the Berlin Wall. They commemorate the division of Germany and the struggle for German unity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ben Wagin likes to plant ginkgo trees and, so far, has planted more than 50,000 all over the world. With his art and other projects, he is trying to make people think about the relationship between mankind and nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also paints, including his now famous <em>Weltbaum </em>mural in Berlin, which he created in 1975. At that time, words like street art and graffiti hadn&rsquo;t yet been invented and no-one talked about murals. Wagin created one of Berlin&rsquo;s first large-scale murals. He&rsquo;s a pioneer, a role model for future generations of street artists. And every day, tens of thousands of Berlin&rsquo;s residents and visits see his art as they travel around the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Passengers can look out of the window at Tiergarten S-Bahn station and admire <em>Weltbaum I &ndash; Gr&uuml;n ist Leben</em>. It adorns the wall of Siegmunds Hof 21, on the corner of Bachstra&szlig;e. The tree screams in agony as exhaust gases from the machine beneath choke it to death. A barge sails across the top of the picture. It is loaded with trees &ndash; a gloomy vision of the future. We are destroying our natural world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A tree is on the move </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>Weltbaum </em>in Tiergarten is getting on in years and the paint is starting to fade. But it&rsquo;s still a shock for the artist when he discovers that the tree is going to be covered over by a new building. A high-rise office building is going up on the empty plot in front of the mural. The tree has disappeared from view. There&rsquo;s just a narrow gap between the new building and the painting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s time for a change &ndash; why not relocate the tree? In spring 2018 the <em>Weltbaum </em>is moved from Tiergarten to its new home in Moabit.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>The world&rsquo;s longest open-air gallery is being created in Berlin. It&rsquo;s the first art project to be undertaken by a united Germany since the fall of the Berlin Wall and attracts artists from all over the world. The East Side Gallery opened in Berlin-Friedrichshain on 28 September 1990, and it is still one of the city&rsquo;s most popular sights.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>The Wall has gone! Well, almost. The border posts have been torn down, but kilometres of concrete wall are still snaking through the city. East and West Germans and visitors from all over the world descend on Berlin in the hope of taking home a little piece of the Wall. They hack at the monstrous construction with hammers, chisels and pneumatic drills. The GDR&rsquo;s border guards and Bundeswehr take care of the rest. They tear down the Wall, the symbol of Germany&rsquo;s division.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A symbol of separation becomes a work of art </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just a few sections of the wall remain, including a long stretch on the banks of the Spree. In spring 1990, this provides the perfect canvas for artists from Germany and around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>West Berliners have been covering the wall with their paintings and graffiti for years, but in the East people were kept away from the border by barbed wire and self-firing weapons. Now they have been given permission to paint by the GDR Council of Ministers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For six months, the area between Oberbaumbr&uuml;cke and Ostbahnhof reeks of paint. 118 artists from 21 nations help to create the open-air gallery. The air is abuzz with different languages. In 1990 Berlin is on the move. Everyone is gripped by a mood of change; the city feels electric. The East Side Gallery provides a space for free expression.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Freedom, peace, breaking down barriers &ndash; the artists immortalise these themes in their fantasy-filled paintings on the remains of the Wall. The concrete canvas stretches for 1.3 kilometres. The monument of terror is transformed into a vibrant work of art. Berlin&rsquo;s residents and visitors look on in amazement &ndash; as you are doing now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Trabis and fraternal kisses </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s so much to see, from surreal images to political statements. Dimitri Vrubel depicts a brotherly kiss between Honecker and Brezhnev, while artist Birgit Kinder &ldquo;makes dreams come true through painting&rdquo; <sup>1 </sup>A Trabant smashes through the wall, symbolising East Germany&rsquo;s Peaceful Revolution of 1989. It&rsquo;s called Test the Best. On its journey to the West, the Trabi discovers the best of this new world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the East Side Gallery quickly begins to crumble, attacked by souvenir hunters, vandals and air pollution. It has been restored regularly over the years. Some works have been sandblasted, others have been repainted and given a special coating. As of 2018, the Berlin Wall Foundation is to take over the maintenance and preservation of the East Side Gallery.</p>\r\n",

There&rsquo;s no free parking either, but at least you don&rsquo;t have to go to jail. Kottbusser Tor, Lausitzer Stra&szlig;e and Oranienplatz are on the board, but they&rsquo;re not for sale.

"mainText": "<p>It all starts in the summer of 2014. In Berlin&rsquo;s Kreuzberg district, a group of young people are poring over a city map. They&rsquo;re not looking for the tastiest doner kebab, the coolest skatepark or the hippest bar. They&rsquo;re looking for places where people are being forced to leave their homes to make way for luxury redevelopment projects. What&rsquo;s the best way to stage a protest? Who does this city actually belong to?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The side of a house becomes a giant Monopoly board&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s the start of an extraordinary project. The Orangotango initiative organises a workshop for young people. A map has been produced to illustrate the ongoing process of displacement and gentrification in Kreuzberg. The young activists decide to turn it into a piece of art. The cooperative housing project at Manteuffelstra&szlig;e 39 in Kreuzberg provides them with an empty firewall. Several graffiti collectives get involved in the neighbourhood project. As you can see, the result is pretty eye-catching!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The young artists only have one weekend to create their street art. They project the image onto the wall and spray-paint each section, like painting by numbers. The weekend is one big party, with sausages sizzling on the barbecue and plenty of cold drinks. Fresh vegetables are provided by the community garden in the Tempelhofer Feld.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Passers-by soon realise that that the image on the wall is a Monopoly board! But in this version of the game, no one is striving to build a real estate empire, and nobody is going bust. Quite the opposite, in fact.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The battle for public spaces </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each space on the board represents one of the hotspots in the argument about the future of the city. The banks of the river Spree represent the loss of access to water. In Reichenberger Stra&szlig;e, a lift transports cars straight into their owner&rsquo;s luxury apartments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But many of the images depict places where people are resisting being squeezed out of their neighbourhoods. There&rsquo;s the K&ouml;pi building in K&ouml;penicker Stra&szlig;e, one of the city&rsquo;s last squats, though it has now been legalised. There&rsquo;s the communal garden on Bethaniendamm. And at the end of G&ouml;rlitzer Park on the former death strip, there&rsquo;s the Wagenburg Lohm&uuml;hle, a camp and caravan site for drop-outs and dissenters.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Urban development has already overtaken some of the images. On the mural, the Cuvry urban wasteland still allows public access to the Spree. And an investor is building offices on the spot where &ldquo;Reclaim your city&rdquo; was once daubed on the giant firewall. So who does this city belong to? Is Berlin just a giant Monopoly board for investors who want everything to be sold off? Some of these questions are answered in the new (2017) version of the young people&rsquo;s city map.</p>\r\n",

Passers-by stop to watch what&rsquo;s going on. Some have tears in their eyes. Others are simply stunned. Boos and whistles are directed towards the painters who are covering over one of Berlin&#39;s most iconic pieces of graffiti. They are erasing one of the icons of the city&rsquo;s street art scene.

He spends several days and nights painting two huge white figures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reclaim your city </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One figure stands upright, the other is upside down. They&rsquo;re pulling at each other&rsquo;s masks in an attempt to see the face underneath. The fingers of their free hands form the letters W and E &ndash; West and East.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the top right corner are the words &ldquo;Reclaim Your City&rdquo;. The mural is just a few metres from the remains of the Berlin Wall. One year later, Blu paints a headless figure on the adjacent firewall. The faceless businessman wears a gold watch on each wrist, linked together by a chunky gold chain. He&rsquo;s adjusting his tie with his manacled hands.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These paintings are icons of Berlin&#39;s street art scene. The sightseeing buses slow down as they drive past because tourists love the murals. Tour guides bring their groups here to admire these city landmarks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Another open space disappears </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you walk north along Cuvrystra&szlig;e, you quickly reach the River Spree. The first beach bars opened here in the 1990s. The land on Cuvrystra&szlig;e changes hands several times &ndash; it&rsquo;s ripe for development. But local residents want to keep it for themselves. They set up a protest camp to oppose plans to build the BMW Guggenheim Lab. It&rsquo;s like a favela in the middle of Kreuzberg. People are sleeping in tents and homemade wooden shacks. Eviction notices become part and parcel of daily life. They are fighting to keep one of the last open spaces in Kreuzberg. The police eventually clear the site in September 2014. Then the bulldozers move in and start preparing the land for building the office complex.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blu doesn&rsquo;t want his artwork to exist in these surroundings. He doesn&rsquo;t want it to be part of a development that forces people out of their homes to make way for luxury housing that they can&rsquo;t afford. The artist also sees the destruction of his murals as a wake-up call. His art as a symbol of resistance has had its day. &ldquo;Reclaim Your City&rdquo; is now just &ldquo;Your City&rdquo;.

"mainText": "<p>Right here, where the first singer is getting ready, this was part of the death zone that divided the city until 1989. The area has a colourful history. Once farmland, in the 19th century it was turned into a military parade ground. Berliners called the area &ldquo;The Lone Poplar&rdquo; after its solitary poplar tree. Later on, it became the site of a sports facility and a freight station. From 1961 to 1989, the site was part of the no-mans-land between East and West Berlin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The area opens up again after the fall of the Wall, and Berliners are quick to claim it as their own. Five years later, it has been transformed into a public space, the Mauerpark. Together with the huge flea market next door, it fast becomes one of the city&#39;s most popular attractions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2009 Joe Hatchiban starts putting on karaoke sessions in the park, and they quickly become world famous. They are not about great singing. Nobody needs to feel embarrassed. You just need the courage to get up and have fun. Right now, an older guy is singing La Bamba. He barely hits a note. But the crowd loves it anyway and thanks him with loud applause.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In front of the stage, someone is riding a bike dressed as a frog. Two girls are sunbathing topless. A juggler starts warming up. The air smells of barbecued food. You can try your hand at spray painting a section of the Wall &ndash; all legal and above board. It&rsquo;s a place for people to have fun and enjoy the freedom that epitomises Berlin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the Mauerpark is not particularly attractive. Where other parks have trees, hedges and benches, the Mauerpark is mainly large swathes of grass, perhaps more brown than green. But what makes the park so attractive is its diverse visitors, their openness and friendliness. Typical Berlin.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>The Reichstag dome is not just a stunning piece of architecture. It also symbolises a new era of transparency in German politics. But it was almost never built.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>You are about to enter the Reichstag dome, which has become one of Berlin&#39;s most famous landmarks. But architect Sir Norman Foster had some very different ideas for it back in the early &lsquo;90s. He wanted to hang a kind of flat canopy over the whole Reichstag building, but critics said it looked like a giant petrol station.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, when you climb the 40.7 metres to the viewing platform in the Reichstag dome, you are rewarded with incredible views over Berlin. This is all thanks to two political parties &ndash; the CDU and CSU &ndash; and to Helmut Kohl himself. After reunification, the CDU/CSU Union failed to gain support for its plans to rebuild the historic Reichstag dome, so in the end they agreed to compromise and build a modern dome in glass and steel.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Foster gives in to the politicians &ndash; and creates a masterpiece&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It turns out to be an excellent decision. Because it forces the architect to create an icon, a masterpiece that is famous around the world. For the very first time, a parliament building has been topped with a see-through dome and it open to the public.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you climb the two large steel ramps that spiral up to the top of the dome, you can sense the excitement that was triggered by Foster&rsquo;s second design. You are treated to an unparalleled, ever-changing vista. With every step, you get a different view of central Berlin &ndash; the Tiergarten, the government district, Potsdamer Platz.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Foster&rsquo;s 23-metre-high dome isn&rsquo;t only a feast for the eyes. It is also brimming with high-tech features. At the centre of the dome is a giant cone consisting of 360 mirrors, which catch the daylight and direct it down into the debating chamber.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Radical symbolism and transparency at the centre of political power&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A computer-controlled sun shield tracks the movement of the sun and blocks the light from individual mirrors to prevent excessive glare. The cone also acts as a vent, drawing stale air out of the debating chamber to an opening at the top of the dome.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between 1995 and 1999, Foster and his team installed 800 tons of steel and 3,000 square metres of glass in Germany&#39;s state-of-the-art domed structure. And yet the true fascination of the design lies in its radical symbolism. Of all people, it is the Germans, whose Nazi dictatorship led to the greatest political catastrophe of the 20th century, who can now quite literally look down on their parliamentarians. They have created a new kind of transparency at their centre of political power.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The need to renovate the Reichstag to make it suitable for its current use led to the creation of a beacon of democracy that sends out a message to the world. Today the Reichstag dome is Berlin&rsquo;s most-visited landmark. Attracting some two million visitors a year, it is the supreme symbol of German reunification.</p>\r\n",

No wonder they are proud as they watch specially trained rock climbers fix the last roll of material. At long last, the Wrapped Reichstag is a reality &ndash; enclosed entirely in 100,000 square meters of glittering silver fabric.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>In 1971, Christo and Jeanne-Claude receive a postcard of Berlin&rsquo;s Reichstag building. It is sent by American journalist Michael S. Cullen, who lives in the city. He writes that he hopes Christo will wrap the Reichstag. At this time, Christo and Jeanne-Claude already have an international reputation. They are fascinated by the idea of wrapping the Reichstag. After all, in the divided city of Berlin, the Reichstag stands directly at the border separating two opposing political systems and is visible from East and West.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A long road to travel&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christo and Jeanne-Claude talk to politicians and the authorities in Berlin, refusing to be put off. In the meantime, the artist couple wrap such structures as the Pont Neuf bridge in Paris or surround eleven islands between Miami and Miami beach with pink polypropylene fabric. But they still keep fighting for permission to wrap Berlin&rsquo;s Reichstag.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With German reunification in 1990, the project gains a new momentum. Germany is gripped by a feeling of a new dawn. The German parliament debates Christo and Jeanne-Claude&rsquo;s proposed art project. For the first time in German history, the elected representatives vote on an art performance. It looks like a close result. Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Interior Minister Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble voice their objections. Doesn&rsquo;t the project put the dignity of the Reichstag at risk? But finally a majority of German MPs take a different view. The vote goes in favour of the project &ndash; the Reichstag is to be wrapped!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A public festival at the Reichstag </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Work starts on 16 June 1995. Even the process of wrapping the Reichstag is an event. Christo&rsquo;s design does not use scaffolding. A local crowd watches enthralled as 90 rock climbers let down the long rolls of fabric from the roof, fastening them with ropes. It takes seven days to finish this temporary art work. Growing numbers of visitors and locals come to marvel at the Wrapped Reichstag, soon a favourite subject for photographers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where you are now standing, there was a truly magical mood. During those summer days, the square quickly turns into a spontaneous festival, with people on the lawn, barbecuing, making music and playing football. For two weeks, the Wrapped Reichstag seems to emanate peace and joy across the city &ndash; a festival of art making headlines around the world. This special summer event, attracting over five million people, only has one day of bad weather. Even those, like Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble, initially sceptical about the project are converted. When the performance is over, the rolls of fire-resistant aluminised polypropylene are taken down and recycled.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Reichstag looks just as always &ndash; and yet something is different. Almost as though the glittering material has freed the building from its past. Shortly afterwards, British architect Norman Foster starts work on refurbishing the Reichstag as the future seat of the German Bundestag. A new chapter begins.</p>\r\n",

But space and budgets are tight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The move needs to be professionally managed, so Environment Minister Klaus T&ouml;pfer is appointed as relocation officer in 1995. He assigns the Foreign Office an old building on Werderscher Markt.

The National Socialists built it as the Reichsbank, and this is where they stored the gold that supported the war economy. A little later, it was occupied by the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). This is where General Secretaries Walter Ulbricht and Erich Honecker decided on GDR policy. The SED&rsquo;s massive party emblem was removed from the fa&ccedil;ade in 1990.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And now it&rsquo;s home to the Federal Foreign Office? The building&rsquo;s history makes some people feel a little queasy, but relocation manager T&ouml;pfer takes it all in his stride. All three eras &ndash; National Socialism, the GDR, and the new Berlin Republic have their place in the renovation plans. The architects are very conscious of the building&rsquo;s history but are looking forwards.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A window on the city&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Foreign Office is also getting a facelift. A light and airy glass building pops up in front of the old building, which is too small to accommodate all the ministry&rsquo;s staff. It elegantly conceals the view of the Nazis&rsquo; intimidating architecture. The foyer at the Foreign Office regularly holds exhibitions that are open to the public. The ministry sees itself as a window on the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the ceremony in the <em>Weltsaal</em>, Joschka Fischer goes to his office on the second floor.

It is vital to prevent the re-emergence of a centralised power that neutralises politics and sweeps aside democracy and freedom. The Bundesrat is an important instrument here, as it represents the federal system that underpins Germany&rsquo;s 16 federal states. It acts as an important bridge between the country&rsquo;s federal and state governments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bundesrat has 69 members, including the minister-presidents or mayors of the various states.

The arrival of this institution breathes new life into the building, which is in the shadow of the Berlin Wall and has stood empty for many years.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GDR only used parts of the building, with the foyer serving as a kitchen and the plenary chamber as a storage area.

These particular Graces come in the shape of pointed staves made of gold-coloured brass hanging down form three dome-shaped openings in the ceiling.

Der Spiegel magazine comments: &ldquo;Would a German court have ruled the same way if a policeman had been shot by a student with a similarly unresolved question of guilt?&rdquo;. <sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few days later, just such a student is sitting in the dock. Fritz Teufel is accused of committing a serious breach of the peace, also on the evening of 2 June, during the protests against the Shah&rsquo;s visit. The witnesses are two police officers, who say they saw him throwing stones.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But Teufel is not brought to the court through the imposing entrance and magnificent lobby that you can now enter, this &lsquo;cathedral&rsquo; symbolising the grandeur of the law.&nbsp; This magnificent building of Wilhelmine Berlin was built between 1902 and 1906. When it opened, it was the first building in the city to have electric lighting. But all the technical advances, from elevators to central heating and telephones, are of little use to Fritz Teufel. Since 2 June, he has been housed in the star-shaped remand prison on the eastern side of the criminal court complex. He is led directly to the courtroom via a labyrinth of hidden corridors.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The courtroom becomes a soapbox&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The inhabitant of the political commune known as Kommune I knows how to make the most of the occasion, provoking the court with his witty remarks and insinuations. He shows little respect for the rituals of justice, showing up in bright clothes and with tousled hair. And as for standing up when the judges enter the courtroom? Teufel tells the court he will only stand &ldquo;If it serves to reveal the truth&rdquo;. <sup>2 </sup>He is acquitted on 22 December 1967 &ndash; the policemen who accused him were lying, and Teufel is once again a free man after spending 148 days in prison.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kurras also lied. He presented the court with several versions of how Ohnesorg came to be shot. Keen to cover up the circumstances of his death, the Berlin police donated 60,000 D-Marks to his defence fund. On that fateful evening, student Friederike Dollinger cradled Ohnesorg&rsquo;s head as he lay dying. She says: &ldquo;The acquittal of Kurras was a turning point. It increased my sense of distance and scepticism towards the Federal Republic of that time. This tortuous notion of putative self-defence that contradicted everything I experienced that night.&rdquo; <sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>She was not the only one to feel like this, and the student movement began to gain traction. Meanwhile, Teufel joined the underground 2 June Movement, named after the date of Benno Ohnesorg&rsquo;s death. This led him further down a path of resistance that culminated in armed combat and terrorism.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>In 1998, brothers Jan and Tim Edler were sharing a studio with other artists on Museum Island. Every day, they looked out over the Spree Canal as they worked. Nothing ever happened on this long stretch of water &ndash; the stretch of river in the centre of Berlin was always deserted. The two brothers pondered how to change this and came up with an idea that is as simple as it is groundbreaking.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>20 years on, and the musings of the Edler brothers have become a national urban development project with funding from the German government and Berlin Senate. Flussbad Berlin is an inspired example of forward-looking urban development.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So much more than an open-air swimming pool&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Edlers struck a chord with their plan to transform the &ldquo;dead&rdquo; section of the Spree into a lively, publicly accessible bathing area. The promotional photo montage of people swimming up and down near the wide steps in front of Berlin Cathedral is captivating &ndash; simply stepping into the Spree and starting swimming must bring an incredible sense of freedom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the people behind the idea are planning more than an open-air swimming pool in the historic heart of the city. In 2012 they organise themselves into a non-profit organisation and start work on plans to transform a section of canal near Fischerinsel. They want to create an ecological regeneration zone by planting the banks and installing a new jetty. There are also plans to create a 300-metre-long natural plant filter in the Friedrichsgracht area. This is needed because overflows in the sewage system can occasionally lead to contamination in the <em>Kupfergraben</em>, the area that is designated as the bathing area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>All set for 2025&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jan and Tim Edler&rsquo;s idea is already 20 years old, but it will still take time to turn their dream into reality. The project involves many complex challenges, decision-making processes and funding issues, but there&rsquo;s light at the end of the tunnel for Berlin&rsquo;s swimmers &ndash; the Flussbad is due to open by 2025 at the latest. Until then, there is an annual opportunity to officially swim by the Cathedral. Four years ago, the members of the Flussbad Berlin Association launched the Berlin Flussbad Trophy as a way of promoting their project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Flussbad supporter Johannes Riedner sums up why it is so important to turn their plans into reality. When he first swam in the Spree years ago, he says it was a truly unforgettable experience: &ldquo;It was like taking heroin, a sense of releasing the neurotransmitters in the brain &ndash; a feeling of pure happiness that I want to experience again.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup></p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>In the 15th century, if you were to stand on this very spot where the Berlin Palace is now being built, you would have seen towers instead of cranes and heard the sound of horse-drawn carriages instead of pneumatic drills. It was the residence of the feudal nobility, then the Prussian kings, and later the imperial court. After being badly damaged during the Second World War, the palace was blown up in 1950 on the orders of the East German government and replaced by the Palast der Republik. In the end this palace was also demolished between 2006 and 2008 because of the asbestos used in its construction.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>One man in particular is fascinated by the history of the palace &ndash; the entrepreneur Wilhelm von Boddien. Ever since Germany&rsquo;s reunification, this lover of fine architecture has been hoping the magnificent building will be restored to life. In 1992 he sets up a foundation to lobby for its reconstruction and pays for a full-size canvas mock-up of the palace in its original location.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Understanding the world as a whole&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This proves to be controversial, and some critics claim the building embodies a &ldquo;national neurosis&rdquo;. <sup>1 </sup>However, in 2002, a large majority in the German Bundestag approves the reconstruction of the palace as a seat for the Humboldt Forum, which will provide a &ldquo;showcase for the cultures of the world&rdquo;. <sup>2 </sup>Wilhelm von Boddien&rsquo;s foundation continues to collect donations for the reconstruction of the building&rsquo;s historic facade, and by 2018 has amassed around 80 million euros.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The palace is to be more than just a tourist attraction. The new building with the baroque fa&ccedil;ade will house the Humboldt Forum &ndash; a centre for art, culture, science and education. It is due to open in late 2019, 30 years after the fall of the Wall. Admission will be free of charge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Named after the Humboldt brothers, the Humboldt Forum aims to present the challenges and opportunities faced by the whole world through a series of fascinating exhibitions, research projects, talks and other events. This is the idea behind the Humboldt Forum&rdquo;, writes Horst Bredekamp, Professor of Art History and, until June 2018, one of the founding directors of the Humboldt Forum. <sup>3</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Squaring up to controversy </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What can you expect when you visit the Forum? The Humboldt Forum is very aware of the discussion about the provenance of museum exhibits and Germany&rsquo;s colonial past. Where did the exhibits come from? Were they donated? Were they obtained legally? Or were they effectively stolen? With the relocation of the non-European collections from the Dahlem museum to their new home in central Berlin, the spotlight will not only be turned on the beauty of the exhibits, but also on their origins.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>Berlin is full of churches &ndash; but from 2019 it will be home to a truly unique place of worship. The House of One is the first interfaith building designed for Christians, Jews and Muslims. This revolutionary idea of a common place of worship for all three monotheistic religions has attracted its fair share of praise and criticism alike. Can such a project really succeed?</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>Lack of publicity is certainly not a problem for the project&rsquo;s founders. When they first announced their unusual plan for the House of One, they attracted worldwide attention, including reports in the <em>Washington Post </em>and the Arab news channel <em>Al Jazeera</em>. At a time of global religious conflict, the world&#39;s first combination of church, mosque and synagogue is causing quite a stir.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check out the plans for the House of One online &ndash; you&rsquo;ll see a modern brick building divided into separate sections. Each religion has its own space for worship and there is a communal room where worshippers and members of the public can come together and learn more about each other&rsquo;s religions. The Berlin architectural firm Kuehn Malvezzi has pared the traditional characteristics of sacred buildings back to their most elementary forms. It was important to ensure that no one religion was seen to predominate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How is it possible to have a communal building where the three religious communities still have their own space? This question is often asked, but Imam Kadir Sanci is confident it will work: &ldquo;I think our building is like a shared flat. We all live together. Everyone has their own room, but there&rsquo;s a kitchen where we can all meet up. We&rsquo;re not looking to create a new religion or mix them up. We&rsquo;re all different, but we belong together.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the project also has its critics. Journalist Maritta Adam-Tkalec has openly addressed the difficulties experienced by Christians and Jews in finding a &ldquo;strong Muslim partner&rdquo;. <sup>2 </sup>Many Berlin Muslims do not accept the G&uuml;len movement, which is now on board, as the sole representative of Islam.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A wooden hut stands on Petriplatz, where the GDR government once ordered the demolition of Berlin&rsquo;s oldest church. It holds a scale model of the communal room that will be built in the House of One. The success of this 43-million-euro project also depends on the success of the crowdfunding campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea originated in the Protestant community of Father Gregor Hohberg. He remains optimistic: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a real desire for religions to co-exist in harmony. Now we have to find a way to turn this desire into donations.&rdquo; <sup>3 </sup>The project has funding in place until the foundation stone is laid in 2019.</p>\r\n",

The state-owned property company that administered this particular piece of land had no interest in seeing it turned into a permanent green space, but it agreed to let the non-profit organisation Nomadisch Gr&uuml;n (Nomadic Green) rent it on a monthly basis.

Berlin&rsquo;s first city farm is home to a multitude of fascinating tenants, including thousands of fish (cichlids) and its popular basil that is &ldquo;grown in the city&rdquo;.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>Fish and veg? Sounds weird, but it&rsquo;s part of a revolution in food production. And it&rsquo;s happening right here in the heart of the city &ndash; at Ecofriendly Farmsystems (ECF). This aquaponics farm is run by Nicolas Leschke and Christian Echternacht with a focus on environmentally friendly, sustainable food production.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The magic words? Resource efficiency </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company&rsquo;s two founders rolled up their sleeves and converted part of the complex into an urban farm. At its heart are the fish tanks that accommodate around 40,000 fish per year. Rainwater is filtered into the tanks, the fish food is organic, and giving the fish antibiotics is a no-no for Leschke and team.&nbsp;&nbsp; The result is the farm&rsquo;s own delicious perch. The city-farmed fish not only taste good but are a key component in the ECF food chain. Their liquid excretions are converted into nitrates by the action of bacteria. These nitrates are then used to fertilise the vegetables and herbs that are grown in the nearby greenhouses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tomatoes, aubergines, cucumbers, peppers, herbs, lemon grass, salads, chard and more grow on substrates such as rock wool and expanded clay. The farm&rsquo;s bestsellers are its own brand of basil and tomatoes. The vegetables and herbs are watered using the filtered, nitrate-rich water from the fish tanks. The plants&rsquo; roots are immersed in the nutrient-rich solution &ndash; and grow like weeds! Leschke estimates a single plant can produce 50 kilos of tomatoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Taking Berlin&rsquo;s aquaponics to the world </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term aquaponics comes from aquaculture, meaning fish farming, and hydroponics, which means growing plants in water. Along with their own farm, the two founders also design and build aquaponics systems for customers all over the world. The Berlin farm is both a flagship project and an expanding test site. It&rsquo;s city-grown perch and basil are available in selected supermarkets &ndash; or pick some up on a tour of the farm.</p>\r\n",

At the 2012 Paralympics in London, the Dutch sprinter set a new world record for the 100 and 200 metres &ndash; with the help of high-tech carbon-fibre prostheses made by the German company Ottobock. The prosthetics manufacturer is based at the Ottobock Science Center on Potsdamer Platz.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p><strong>Freedom through movement </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>White rooms, digital panels, computer simulations, artificial limbs &ndash; is this a glimpse of the future? Or is it the latest science fiction movie? In fact, it&rsquo;s a normal day at the Ottobock Science Center in Berlin. Ottobock has been developing cutting-edge medical technology for the last 100 years. Its prostheses, orthoses and wheelchairs give disabled people a whole new level of mobility. And when you visit the Science Center, the company beams you to new worlds.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The central theme of the exhibition is <em>understanding what moves us</em>. How do humans balance? How does it feel to travel around Berlin in a wheelchair? What happens to our legs when we sprint? For professional athletes like Marlou van Rhijn, that&rsquo;s an important question. When the two-time world champion tries out her new running blades before the 2016 Paralympics in Rio she is blown away: &ldquo;Wow, these are exactly what I&rsquo;ve been looking for. I can&rsquo;t wait to line up at the start.&rdquo; <sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As soon as you approach the Science Center building you can tell that the future is at home here. The building has a very futuristic look. The brilliant white panels of its fa&ccedil;ade are designed to look like human muscle fibres. It represents how technology and nature are intertwined, just like in bionics, which takes concepts from biology and transfers them to technology. This is how it is possible to make lifelike prostheses. The next step is artificial legs that are controlled by the mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ottobock goes for gold </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ottobock has always worked closely with the Paralympics by developing new prostheses for athletes and sending staff to the games to support the Paralympians. Sprint world champion Heinrich Popow is one of its customers. In 2017 Popow took part in <em>Let&#39;s dance</em>, a TV show aired on RTL. He said he was keen to inspire people with disabilities to take up sport. At the 2016 Paralympics in Rio, Popow took gold in the long jump, while Marlou van Rhijn won two sprint golds. When you visit the Ottobock Science Center you can take a close look at the athletes&rsquo; running blades and watch a team of robots playing football. And you won&rsquo;t see any &ldquo;Do not touch&rdquo; signs &ndash; you&rsquo;re encouraged to try things out for yourself!</p>\r\n",

As you approach the building, the constant play of light on its outer skin makes you wonder: is this what buildings will look like in future?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A place for exhibitions and encounters&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Futurium is hard to pin down. It has been described as a project initiative, an exhibition centre, a place for encounters, a place for dialogue. Perhaps the best description is &ldquo;a centre for shaping the future&rdquo;. The fact that it doesn&rsquo;t fit into any one category highlights the originality of this new concept.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has been an unusual project right from the start, involving a mix of public and private sponsors, including the German government, leading foundations, scientific organisations and businesses. And it&rsquo;s also no coincidence that this &ldquo;minimum-energy building&rdquo; is right next to the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. The German government wants the Futurium to encourage everyone &ndash; but particularly the younger generation &ndash; to think about the world of tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Could insects be the food of the future?&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The centre will officially open in spring 2019 with a major, changing exhibition on what technology, nature and society could look like in the years to come. The Futurium Lab will be an interactive space where visitors can try out new technologies like 3D printers and laser cutters. And then there&rsquo;s the test kitchen, where you can find out whether you might enjoy tucking into insects in a few years&rsquo; time!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Futurium will be a unique, exciting mix of museum, laboratory and playground.

It is particularly important for families, migrants and senior citizens to have access to multi-purpose public spaces close to their homes. They provide opportunities to chat to other people, learn from each other and help each other. Such spaces also help refugees to play an active, meaningful role in their new home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Build it and they will come&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2011, 13 keen gardeners start using a small part of the 380-hectare open space at the former airport. The project quickly takes off and people are keen to join in. Tourists and journalists turn up to see what&rsquo;s going on. The waiting list starts to grow. Elisabeth Meyer-Renschhausen has little time for gardening these days because she has so many questions to answer. The <em>Allmende Kontor</em> has certainly helped to fuel the urban gardening trend in Berlin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you visit, it&rsquo;s easy to see why. Berlin&rsquo;s best-known community garden is packed with fascinating features. There are bee-keeping and composting groups, workshops on organic pest control and occasional, unplanned lectures. &ldquo;Turkish women come along to grow their vegetables, and they&rsquo;re appalled when they realise that today&rsquo;s youngsters haven&rsquo;t a clue. They feel compelled to show them how to do it.&rdquo;, <sup>2 </sup>says Kontor member Severin Halder.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Unplanned lectures&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The focus of the Allmende founders has always been on sowing the seeds of inspiration. They are keen to arouse people&rsquo;s curiosity and motivate them to start a &ldquo;real&rdquo; garden of their own somewhere in the city.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I think what visitors love most is the space, the freedom&quot;,<sup> 3</sup> says another activist. Let your gaze wander across the vast expanse of the Tempelhofer Feld recreation area and you&rsquo;ll understand why. No other major city has such an incredible panorama right at its heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there&rsquo;s the attractive, alternative atmosphere of the Kontor garden. Raised beds made with scraps of wood, lots of bright colours, just about everything has been improvised. The garden has a certain drop-out charm, but it looks like it&rsquo;s here to stay &ndash; the owner has regularly extended the lease since 2011.</p>\r\n",

This conquest of no man&rsquo;s land began with a project initiated by the art academy: &ldquo;What shall we do with all the empty space in Berlin?&rdquo; A group of students mulled over this question during the 2015 summer term. They came up with the bermudagarten, a garden on a patch of wasteland created with and for the refugees who are temporarily housed in the area. The opening ceremony is held at the DGZ-Ring, a local authority office in Wei&szlig;ensee. The Berlin daily taz describes the project as &ldquo;an important social project&rdquo;. <sup>1</sup> The students used to call this desolate patch of land the Bermuda Triangle, so bermudagarten seems like an obvious choice of name.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A garden without borders </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rocket and radishes, beans and beer are now the order of the day in this multicultural community garden. In the evenings, students and refugees, locals and free-thinkers gather for a chat around the raised beds.

Sometimes the students show a film &ndash; often starring Charlie Chaplin because silent films have no &ldquo;language barriers&rdquo;. <sup>2 </sup>They teach the kids to draw and the refugees teach the students to cook. The air is full of exotic aromas. Now and then, music floats across the former no man&#39;s land. The garden is open to anyone who wants to help with the gardening and be part of the project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A green Utopia </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s the summer of 2025, ten years after the project began. The once temporary garden is now a permanent feature. The former wasteland has become a green oasis in the heart of the city.

Every gardener decides for themselves what they want to grow.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The local children can escape the confines of their small apartments and race around to their hearts&rsquo; content. The bermudagarten is a place of freedom and self-expression. As the sun slowly sets, the smell of charcoal, cevapcici and gyros blends with the sounds of Arabic, Syrian, Portuguese and German.

They are interested in alternative forms of social and ecological urban development, where decisions about the future are not taken by speculators but by committed local residents.

The vegetable beds, school gardens and other cultivated areas are another step towards living more closely with nature in the heart of the city. Plans are also afoot to create rooftop gardens so that the people who live and work there can be more self-sufficient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A decision has not yet been made about what to do with the land on the other side of the railway line that currently splits the Holzmarkt site in two.

It&rsquo;s packed with incredible sights and sounds, but above all with irresistible tastes and aromas. The perfect place to make tofu!</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>Historic Markthalle Neun opened its doors in 1891, but after many years of being used by discounters it was only truly brought back to life in October 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step inside and you&rsquo;ll find the TofuTussis, two young women who produce the kind of fresh tofu that even non-vegetarians fall in love with. In the Markthalle, the duo have found the perfect place to make and sell their soy-based products. They make all of their own products down in the cellar &ndash; curry-mango tofu, algae-smoked tofu, soya burgers, kimchi and other unusual vegetarian ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The TofuTussis experiment with German soybeans, grinding them up to produce a milky liquid, then adding herbs and spices and turning them into tofu. But of course, the market offers more than just soya products. At Kumpel &amp; Keule, one of the market hall&rsquo;s very first vendors, you can watch the butchers at work behind the glass storefront. The Markthalle also puts on cookery courses, concerts and specific food-related events such as the Sunday Breakfast Market and Street Food Thursday.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A walk through food history&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take a stroll through the 250 stalls on a Friday or Saturday and you&rsquo;ll have a chance to sample ancient varieties of fruit and vegetables from local producers. And you&rsquo;ll discover how salt marsh mountain cheese is rinsed with white wine. The TofuTussis also see themselves as pioneers, breaking down people&rsquo;s prejudices against the soy-based product. You say it tastes like nothing? Hang on, maybe you&#39;ve never actually eaten fresh tofu? Here, try this. See! It&rsquo;s really nice! And they&rsquo;ve made another convert.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea behind TofuTussis is simple yet brilliant. When people know how much effort and love goes into their food, they once again start to appreciate and respect quality produce and artisanship. It&#39;s also a chance to bring food production back into the city, says Elena Grimm, one of the TofuTussis. With their relatively small budget, they would have struggled to open elsewhere in Berlin. They are happy to be a part of the Markthalle and love the interaction with other vendors, producers and customers. The Markthalle has once again become a meeting place &ndash; just like in 1891.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>Some street artists are fiercely opposed to the Urban Nation Museum in Berlin, vowing to never set foot in it. For them, urban art belongs in the street, not in specially created exhibition spaces. Are they missing out? Yes &ndash; on what is perhaps the capital&rsquo;s coolest and most unusual art gallery.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>Even as you walk up to the museum&rsquo;s entrance, you can tell it&rsquo;s not like a normal art gallery. As you approach Urban Nation you encounter your first pieces of art on the walls of B&uuml;lowstra&szlig;e in Berlin&rsquo;s Sch&ouml;neberg district. Then you find yourself in front of the massive, distinctive facade of the museum itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A museum without a museum director&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s just as unusual when you step inside. Admission is free (always and for everyone). The museum floor is asphalted like the city streets that normally provide the setting for tape art, street art and graffiti. And you are actively encouraged to take photos. Yasha Young is not the Museum Director but, in true advertising agency style, introduces herself on the website as Executive Creative Director.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The museum is an information hub that is truly one of a kind&rdquo;. <sup>1 </sup>This is how she describes her selection of contemporary urban art. Young has spent many years in New York and now her focus is on &ldquo;conducting a public conversation&rdquo;. <sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The museum aims to exhibit, explain, preserve and classify graffiti and street art so that it can shake off its reputation for being mere vandalism. Alongside the exhibition, Young is achieving this through projects with students, young artists, the neighbouring church and a local care home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But above all, Urban Nation wants to astonish its visitors. This begins with the elaborately remodelled Wilhelminian-style building in Sch&ouml;neberg. Architect Thomas Willemeit has created rooms with &ldquo;insanely high ceilings&rdquo;, <sup>3 </sup>perfect for such large-format works of art. Bridges have been suspended so that you can walk diagonally across the rooms and get up close to the artworks. This exciting &ldquo;parkour&rdquo; provides all kinds of different perspectives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Massive, changing images on the building&rsquo;s facade&nbsp; </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the <em>piece de resistance </em>of Willemeit and his team is the museum&rsquo;s modular, interchangeable facade. At regular intervals, street artists transform the whole facade into a gigantic mural. These huge works are later dismantled and stored in the archives. Inside, there is room for some 150 works. Most of the exhibits are by the greats of the street art scene, but up-and-coming artists are also commissioned to create works specially for Urban Nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is no surprise that the first official Museum for Urban Contemporary Art should open its doors in Berlin. The former &ldquo;anti-fascist barrier&rdquo; is world famous as a work of graffiti art, and the city has a long tradition of decorating facades and firewalls in the many gaps between its buildings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With an ironic nod to the fact that the street is the natural environment of urban art, Young&#39;s museum calls itself <em>the museum that shouldn&#39;t exist. </em></p>\r\n",

But his plans to build viewing terraces with a caf&eacute; and restaurant were never realised &ndash; until now.

When you climb up the dark stairs and step out onto the roof, the amazing panorama that unfolds before your eyes does indeed make you say &ldquo;Wow!&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The view is still there, and plans to open up the airport roof are now well advanced.

Now Berlin is to have a high-level walk of its own. The sheer scale of the venture is typical of Tempelhof. When the airport was finished in 1941 it was the world&rsquo;s largest building by surface area for the first two years of its existence. It is still the largest listed building in Europe, and the scale of the latest visitor attraction is suitably impressive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The History Gallery will be 1,200 metres long and run the full length of the iconic semicircular building. In addition to the spectacular views, visitors will be treated to a permanent exhibition on the history of the airport, which was built during the Nazi era. It chronicles the origins of the massive building complex and highlights some major historical milestones &ndash; such as the famous Airlift that turned Tempelhof into a symbol of freedom and democracy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Telescopes provide a unique perspective </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just a few months ago, the architectural firm Staab Architekten was commissioned to build the rooftop gallery. If their designs are realised as planned, the exhibitions that make up the History Gallery will include virtual and acoustic components. There are also plans to install a number of telescopes so that visitors can view the historic site in more detail from a unique elevated perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the main attraction will still be the magnificent panorama that Berliners and visitors from all over the world can enjoy from the roof. Soon New York won&rsquo;t be the only city to offer unforgettable walks with stunning views.</p>\r\n",

In the evening, he is sitting in the rectory with his family and members of the congregation. Suddenly, there is a loud knocking at the door. When he opens the door, he sees frightened people, Christians of Jewish ancestry, standing out in the cold. They are fleeing from the SS and SA troops. In Berlin, the synagogues are on fire, and Jewish shops are being looted and plundered. The date &ndash; 9 November 1938.</p>\r\n",

Later, he briefly joins the Nazi Party, but soon leaves it again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Kaulsdorf, he is the Lutheran pastor. The parish council is dominated by Hitler&rsquo;s church party, the German Christians, and they are strongly against his appointment. Gr&uuml;ber joins the Emergency Covenant of Pastors, founded in September 1933 and opposed to the adoption of the Nazi regime&rsquo;s Aryan policy in the church. Soon, he allies himself with the Confessing Church, an inner church movement against the plans for a single pro-Nazi Protestant Church. In his sermons, Gr&uuml;ber openly criticises the Nazi regime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hidden in allotment gardens </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the Nazi regime persecutes Christians with Jewish ancestry, the national Protestant church authorities remain silent. Under the citizenship law introduced by the Nazi regime in 1935, their lives change dramatically. Now, anyone not &ldquo;Aryan&rdquo; under the Nazi racial laws is persecuted by the authorities. The Protestant Reich Church is taken over by the strong pro-Nazi group. But Pastor Gr&uuml;ber offers the persecuted Christians a refuge &ndash; and dozens of them come to Kaulsdorf. Gr&uuml;ber sets up the<em> B&uuml;ro Gr&uuml;ber</em> &ndash;a centre to help those now classified as &ldquo;non-Aryan Christians&rdquo;. The centre is constantly under Gestapo surveillance. In 1938, in the days after the November Pogroms, Gr&uuml;ber organises hiding places for the persecuted Christians in nearby allotment gardens.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His <em>B&uuml;ro Gr&uuml;ber </em>gives them pastoral and practical care, and helps them escape from Germany. He applies for permission for them to emigrate through the usual official channels. One day, Gr&uuml;ber has to face the SS officer Adolf Eichmann, head of the department responsible for Jewish affairs and emigration. Eichmann is one of the main figures responsible for Jewish deportations to the death camps. The two men sit face to face &ndash; but are worlds apart. Eichmann is at a loss why anyone can support &ldquo;these people&rdquo;. <sup>1</sup> Gr&uuml;ber replies by citing the parable of the Good Samaritan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the two years that<em> B&uuml;ro Gr&uuml;ber</em> is active, it helps nearly 2000 people to emigrate. In 1940, the Gestapo closes the centre. Pastor Gr&uuml;ber is arrested, held in concentration camps, first in Sachsenhausen and then Dachau. After two years, his family is allowed to visit. They find him dressed in prison clothing, his teeth knocked out and his head shaven. In 1943, Gr&uuml;ber is released. Broken in body but not in spirit, he returns to Kaulsdorf.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the war, he continues the work he started with his <em>B&uuml;ro Gr&uuml;ber</em>, now helping Holocaust survivors. In the post-war years in Berlin, before the Wall, he lives in the West but regularly goes to East Berlin where he is provost of the St. Mary and St. Nicholas parish. He often acts as a mediator between East and West. When the Wall goes up in 1961, he can no longer travel between the two parts of the city. Heinrich Gr&uuml;ber dies in Berlin in 1975. The help centre he establishes as <em>B&uuml;ro Gr&uuml;ber</em> still lives on today as the Protestant Aid Agency for the Racially Persecuted, a foundation dedicated to helping the Christians persecuted in the Third Reich and their descendants.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>In Berlin&rsquo;s Moabit district, Huttenstra&szlig;e is home to a pivotal development in architectural history. In designing the new AEG Turbine Factory, lead architect Peter Behrens and civil engineer Karl Bernhard create the first formal vocabulary for industrial buildings. The Turbine Factory also employs a mix of modern materials &ndash; combining primarily steel components and glass with the more traditional stone.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>In the early 1900s, AEG is a leading German manufacturer of electrical equipment. To expand its operations, it decides to move into steam turbine production. But for its new division, AEG needs a new large facility, reflecting the global demand for this sector. After all, steam turbines are far more efficient as a source of power than the classic steam engine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Avant-garde architecture</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The commission for the new production hall is awarded to Peter Behrens, an architect and designer who studied at art colleges in Hamburg, Karlsruhe and D&uuml;sseldorf. With his strong background in design, he is also employed by AEG as an artistic consultant. Behrens works on product designs, graphics and the company logo &ndash; essentially creating AEG&rsquo;s corporate design long before such a term even existed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Peter Behrens first came to public notice in 1901, with the design of his house in the Darmstadt Artists&rsquo; Colony. In 1907, he was also a founder member of the Deutscher Werkbund, an association bringing together artists, architects and designers with politicians and industrialists to drive forward the production of high-quality goods. While initially the association drew its inspiration from the English arts and crafts movement, it increasingly turned to focus on architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Germany of those days, there is no dedicated architectural style for industrial buildings. Instead, industrial facades simply tend to follow the historicist revivalist styles dominant during those years. In 1908, Behrens&rsquo; innovative design for the new AEG turbine production hall creates a prototype for modern industrial architecture. The factory hall is constructed with a steel skeleton. The large glass windows filling much of the fa&ccedil;ade surfaces ensure the interior is light and transparent. The bright, natural light is also seen as a means of increasing productivity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Visible function</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Start by looking at the front fa&ccedil;ade with its massive stone elements, recalling an Egyptian temple. Set on either side of the large glass window, the stone creates an impression of grandeur, yet neither of these elements are load bearing. They are just for show, merely external cladding. But contemporaries were quick to pick up Behrens&rsquo; reference to sacral space and soon dubbed the factory hall a <em>machinery cathedral</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In contrast, with visible steel trusses and joints, the side fa&ccedil;ade in Berlichingenstra&szlig;e looks very modern &ndash; just as Karl Bernhard, the project&rsquo;s civil engineer, intended. In this way, rather than concealed behind a pseudo-historical fa&ccedil;ade, the industrial building&rsquo;s function as a production site is clearly inscribed in its design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even today, Bernhard&rsquo;s role is often underestimated. Far from solely making Behrens&rsquo;s ingenious design a reality, he plays a significant part in its creation. Nonetheless, Behrens, as the famous artist architect, has always outshone Karl Bernhard as a civil engineer.

"teasertext": "<p>Here, following the English model of garden cities, architect Bruno Taut first plans an estate with colourful facades.</p>\r\n",
"introtext": "<p>Berlin&rsquo;s population nearly quadruples in the late 1800s. Around 1910, the city is bursting at the seams. Many people are living in overcrowded tenement blocks built rapidly to provide cheap housing. These large blocks of four to five storeys have front, lateral and rear buildings often enclosing several courtyards. The apartments, especially in the rear courtyards, are often cramped, dark and unhealthy.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>Living in such conditions, how can workers in cities remain healthy? That pressing question is already driving social reform in England in the shape of the garden city movement &ndash; and their ideas strike a chord in Germany as well. Founded in 1902, the German Garden City Association (<em>Deutsche Gartenstadtgesellschaft</em>) sets up a building society for greater Berlin and purchases the plot of land around Falkenberg in Berlin&rsquo;s Altglienicke district. In 1912, it then commissions Bruno Taut, just 32 years old, to design a new residential estate on the model of a garden city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A residential estate with a community feeling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the three years between 1913 and 1916, a total of 128 homes are constructed. Taut begins in 1913 by designing 23 residential units in the intimate &ldquo;Akazienhof&rdquo; cul-de-sac development. Around a central greened square, he sets 34 terraced houses for individual families, as well as two semi-detached and one detached house.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This ensemble, arranged in groups, creates something of a small village atmosphere. Here, many years before he designs the Hufeisensiedlung residential estate, Taut is already applying his principle of constructing a self-contained residential courtyard. Rather than the view from the window seeking to force people to become neighbourly, it is intended to encourage a sense of community. In 1913, the first tenants already move in. Over the course of the next two years, the first buildings are followed by a further 94 residential units along the Gartenstadtweg street. In 1916, despite the First World War, some individual houses are still built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his design, Taut breaks with traditionally uniform designs in architecture. Instead, as you&rsquo;ll notice when you stroll through the estate today, the units are not arranged symmetrically, but form groups of one and two-storey buildings. Some are set back from the street to avoid straight axes. It almost seems as if the houses personify the individuals living there, each for itself yet unified in their shared space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This impression is strengthened by one particular feature &ndash; for the first time, Taut uses coloured plaster on the external walls. For example, along Gartenstadtweg, he has 14 colour tones in different combinations, leading the development to be nicknamed the &ldquo;<em>paintbox estate</em>&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, Bruno Taut crucially moves away from the florid designs in the early years of Imperial Germany towards the reduced formal vocabulary later characteristic of modernist architecture. Nonetheless, he still employs standard design elements, with saddleback roofs, red beaver tail tiles and wooden window shutters evoking a rural lifestyle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The spatial setting matters</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Landscaping plays a key role in the idea of the garden city. Taut&rsquo;s residential estate in the Altglienicke district is Berlin&rsquo;s first housing development with an elaborate plan for greening and landscaping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The estate&rsquo;s built and open spaces form a dialogue, with the lines of avenues and hedges emphasising the spatial design and plants and shrubs blending in with the overall colour scheme. Bruno Taut defines this concept as &ldquo;outdoor living space&rdquo;, an important feature of his architectural oeuvre &ndash; and one still visible today in the Falkenberg Garden City.</p>\r\n",

The leading founding figure of this approach to urban planning was Ebenezer Howard, who propagated the &ldquo;marriage of town and country&ldquo;<sup>1</sup>. He saw garden cities as a middle ground to battle overcrowding and slums in large cities without reverting to the potential backwardness of purely rural life. Instead, his garden cities were economically independent and organised to develop and support a sense of community.</p>\n"

"introtext": "<p>Today&rsquo;s Tempelhofer Feld park was once an aviation hub. In 1909, American aviation pioneer Orville Wright flew over these grassy meadows. Later, this was also where the public marvelled at the new Zeppelin airships. Here, between 1936 and 1939, architect Ernst Sagebeil set out to construct the largest airport in Europe at that time &ndash; an elegantly curved airport building, over 1.2km long with over 9000 rooms.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>After the seizure of power in 1933, Hitler and the Nazi party plan to radically rebuilt Berlin as the global capital of the Third Reich. The monumental Tempelhof Airport building belongs to the few plans ever realised. Although never finally completed, it illustrates the ambivalence in Nazi architecture between grand plans and modern construction methods. The main reception hall has an impressive pubic fa&ccedil;ade with 21 entrance doors, elaborately designed windows, reliefs and sculptures including a massive aluminium eagle. The eagle&rsquo;s head is now set in front of the building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A modernist building</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet behind this fa&ccedil;ade with shell limestone slabs and window surrounds of Jura limestone, the airport is a modernist building. In the Weimar Republic, Ernst Sagebeil works for architect Erich Mendelsohn. While Mendelsohn, due to his Jewish heritage, has to flee the Nazis in 1933, Sagebeil is quick to launch his career under the new conditions. His design for the airport is strictly functional, with a systematic division of space into areas for passengers, luggage, freight and post. From the check-in areas, passengers quickly reach the departure gates. Sagebeil&rsquo;s unsupported curved steel roof extending 40 metres out over the airfield is one of the airport&rsquo;s most distinctive features &ndash; and a major technical achievement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the late 1930s, as the preparations for war intensify, construction work on the airport is suspended. Hitler&rsquo;s &ldquo;world airport&rdquo; is never completely finished. Air traffic still uses the old Berlin airport from the 1920s. In the new airport building, forced labourers make armaments for Hitler&rsquo;s war machine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Allies attack Tempelhof Airport several times. At the end of the war, the Soviet Red Army occupies the site. Soon afterwards, when the Allies agree on the occupation zones in Germany and Berlin, Tempelhof Airport is in the American Sector.<strong> </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>An airlift around the clock</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the wake of the Second World War, the antagonisms between the superpowers fuel the Cold War. When the Western Powers plan to introduce the Deutschmark in the western sectors of Berlin even without Soviet agreement, Stalin orders the city to be sealed off. Suddenly, on 24 June 1948 two million residents and the Allied occupying forces are left without sufficient supplies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the Western Powers refuse to abandon West Berlin. Just two days later on 26 June 1948, the first plane with relief supplies lands at Tempelhof Airport. For eleven months, the Western Powers supply West Berlin through an elaborate airlift. The blockade finally ends on 12 May 1949.<strong> </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>West Berlin&rsquo;s &ldquo;gateway to the world&rdquo;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tempelhof Airport only really comes into its own as an airport in a divided Berlin. In 1951, the Americans open the airport to civilian air traffic. For some years, Tempelhof is Germany&rsquo;s largest airport. The war damage is repaired and new annexes constructed. In 1962, Tempelhof Airport is finished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Basic Treaty between West and East Germany in 1972 provides for a road corridor and rail lines connecting Berlin with the West. In air transport, the new generation jet aircraft become the norm &ndash; but the Tempelhof Airport runways are too short for them. West Berlin looks to the new airport in Tegel as the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tempelhof Airport is finally closed in 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today, the airport buildings have become a popular event location. In 2014, in the face of plans to build on the vast airfield, the Berliners push through a referendum on its future use &ndash; and vote overwhelmingly for preserving it as today&rsquo;s Tempelhofer Feld Park, a vast open space in the inner city.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>In the 1920s, Berlin is a world city. But it is also a city where hundreds of thousands of people live in catastrophic conditions. The working-class tenement blocks with their many courtyards are not only dark and dirty, but also grossly overcrowded. Around 1920, one room is often home to five or more people. Hardly any of the rooms have bathrooms. Instead, there are communal toilets in the yards or in the stairwells.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>By the early 1900s, urban planners and architects have long been calling for housing reform and better living conditions. However, only in the 1920s during the Weimar Republic does Berlin become a sounding board for experiments in urban housing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1924, the city of Berlin commissions two housing cooperatives to develop the Gro&szlig;siedlung Britz, a large residential estate in the south of Neuk&ouml;lln. The two cooperatives are the DEGEWO, an association for promoting residential housing, and the GEHAG, a non-profit building and savings shareholding company &ndash; and they represent two radically different approaches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The two sides of an avenue</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The project area is divided into two parts by a curved avenue as the access road. On the right and left of today&rsquo;s Fritz-Reuter-Allee, the two housing cooperatives are to construct three-storey terraced buildings with apartments as well two-storey detached houses. Yet although the remit was the same, the approaches on either side of the avenue could not have been more different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To the east of the avenue, the DEGEWO constructs the Krugpfuhlsiedlung, an estate of traditional residential housing with saddleback roofs, bow fronts and pointed dormer windows. To the west, the GEHAG builds the Hufeisensiedlung estate, its alternative vision of architecture and urban development. When you walk down the avenue today, the contrast is only too apparent. Bruno Taut confronts the more traditional architecture with 32 almost identical housing units set in two long rows with tower-like projecting staircases reminiscent of military architecture. Since the facades are all in a blood-red plaster, the buildings soon became dubbed the <em>Red Front</em>, an allusion not only to the colour but also to the ideological beliefs of the Hufeisensiedlung estate&rsquo;s builders and residents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Air, light and sun</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hufeisensiedlung is named after the estate&rsquo;s horseshoe shape. In employing Bruno Taut, Martin Wagner, then head of the GEHAG and later Berlin&rsquo;s chief city planner, also employs a representative of the Neues Bauen architectural movement. Taut already has a reputation from the years before the First World War for his plans for the Falkenberg Garden City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his designs for the Hufeisensiedlung estate, he sets new benchmarks. The apartments, around 2000 in total, have a standardised floor plan, all with a living room, bedrooms, a kitchen and bathroom. That sounds quite normal today, yet is a luxury in the housing segment at that time for lower-paid workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The construction methods were traditional, although to provide more living space Taut uses flat rather than gabled roofs. The modern windows made the dwellings lighter and provided better ventilation. Every unit had its own garden or at least a view of green open spaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The GEHAG constructs the Hufeisensiedlung estate in six phases from 1925 to 1933. In 1932&ndash;33, the final seventh construction phase is completed under considerable financial constraints. This section is built without Taut&rsquo;s involvement, and is not part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Between aspirations and reality </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hufeisensiedlung is unable to fulfil its social role as a source of affordable healthy and humane housing. The estate&rsquo;s construction is simply too expensive, and the rents are out of the reach of people with low incomes. After the Nazi Party&rsquo;s seizure of power in 1933, many of the residents there are persecuted. One of them is the anarchist writer Erich M&uuml;hsam, murdered in the Oranienburg concentration camp in 1934. Bruno Taut and Martin Wagner also both leave Germany under the Nazi regime and go into exile.</p>\r\n",

He adopts many of the principles and methods advocated by Henry van de Velde at the School of Arts in Weimar. At the Bauhaus, inspired by the idea of the medieval masons&rsquo; guild, teachers (known as &lsquo;masters&rsquo;) and students (known as &lsquo;apprentices&rsquo;) seek to develop a new synthesis of the arts and crafts. In the Bauhaus training, the emphasis is on a new style of architecture, breaking with the historicist revivalist styles dominant in Germany at that time. As in the Deutscher Werkbund association of artisans, designers, artists and architects, the Bauhaus teachers and students create works and designs for production in series. Their goal is to make functional products for daily life affordable for all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1925, with growing political and financial pressure from populist nationalist parties and the local government in Thuringia, the Bauhaus moves to Dessau. But some years after the move, the Bauhaus faces a similar situation again. In 1931, the Nazi Party wins a majority in the Dessau city council and forces through a resolution to close the Bauhaus the following year. In 1932, the Bauhaus moves to Berlin&rsquo;s Lankwitz district. This, though, is just an interlude. After the Nazi Party&rsquo;s seizure of power in early 1933, the political repression culminates in the Bauhaus being forced to close entirely. The dramatic developments in the last phase lead many of the Bauhaus students and teachers to emigrate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fast forward to 1955 and the opening of the Academy of Design in Ulm. There, art historian Hans Maria Wingler meets Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius. Wingler is fascinated by the history of the Bauhaus, and avidly collects Bauhaus documents and objects. In 1960, he establishes the Bauhaus-Archiv. Initially, the collection is to be presented in Darmstadt in a dedicated building designed by Gropius in 1964. However, due to lack of funding, this design is never built.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the state of Berlin offers to host the institution, the Bauhaus-Archiv moves to the city. From 1971, the archive is provisionally housed in Charlottenburg, in the building now home to the Br&ouml;han-Museum for art nouveau, art deco, and functionalism. Berlin had already agreed to finance a new building and provide a site &ndash; in Klingelh&ouml;ferstra&szlig;e, along the Landwehr Canal in Berlin&rsquo;s Tiergarten district. By then Walter Gropius has died, but his original design is modified for the new site by his former colleague Alexander Cvijanovic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Bauhaus-Archiv/Museum f&uuml;r Gestaltung finally opens in 1979. Since then the holdings have steadily grown, but the heart of the collection remains the personal papers and artistic estates, with their draft designs, manuscripts, and letters, originally collected by Hans Maria Wingler. The mission of the Bauhaus-Archiv/Museum f&uuml;r Gestaltung is to locate the history, practices and impact of this avant-garde movement of art, design and architecture in its international context.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>In the 1950s, the Cold War also plays out in the urban planning and residential architecture in the divided city of Berlin. West Berlin is a tiny island surrounded by the Communist East Bloc. In the post-war years, with both East and West suffering from an acute lack of housing, East Germany&rsquo;s Soviet-supported SED regime lands a PR coup. It promises to turn East Berlin into a model future city &ndash; with modern and affordable housing for all.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>Down Stalinallee in Friedrichshain, the building brigades are busy constructing apartment blocks for workers. But these are not just any apartment blocks. The monumental eight-storey buildings have a regal, palatial quality. Behind the neo-classical facades, the apartments are equipped with all mod cons &ndash; and have very affordable rents. This flagship project is not just about new residential space. As a beacon to demonstrate socialism&rsquo;s victory and advantages, it sends a clear signal to those living in West Berlin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>West Berlin needs to find a suitable reply, one also convincingly conveying the message of democracy. So in 1953, West Berlin launches an architectural competition. The winner is a design by architects Willy Kreuer and Gerhard Jobst for buildings in the Neues Bauen style, set generously in the cityscape with large greened spaces between them. An available site is quickly found &ndash; the old Hansaviertel district, completely destroyed in the war.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>An exhibition of luminaries</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Otto Bartning, President of the Association of German Architects (BDA) and a renowned architect in his own right, invites 53 colleagues from 13 countries to design the modern residential housing for the site. His call meets with a remarkable response. Architects from across the world, including such leading figures as Walter Gropius, Oscar Niemeyer and Alvar Aalto, present their designs for residential buildings in West Berlin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1957, the international building exhibition Interbau &lsquo;57 opens in West Berlin. But rather than looking at models or sketches, visitors can admire finished tower and apartment blocks for social housing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike the brick construction in East Berlin, these structures use steel-reinforced concrete. In place of facades in an ornate historicist style, linear designs reflect the function of the buildings. Moreover, since tower blocks can offer more space for apartments, they leave sufficient ground around them for greened areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The construction programme not only includes tower blocks, but also privately-owned detached houses and studio bungalows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Small urban town versus bombastic boulevard</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Hansaviertel district is rather like a little town, with local shops, a cinema, a shopping centre and its own tube station. Set in a building with rows of floor-to-ceiling glass windows, the Hansab&uuml;cherei is one of the first public libraries in Germany with open access shelving. With the Protestant Kaiser Friedrich Memorial Church and the Catholic St. Ansgar parish church, two new churches are also built, both in modern functional designs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Interbau &lsquo;57 opens, it is a magnet for visitors keen to see the show apartments with Scandinavian furniture, Italian fabrics and the famous Bauhaus tubular steel armchairs. Quite aside from the architecture, the thrill of a cable car ride across the district is a real crowd-pleaser.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, though, this is an architectural contest without a victor. For large-scale residential housing, neither the elaborate monumental blocks in a Soviet socialist realist style nor the modern Hansaviertel district tower blocks are a viable option. They are both simply too expensive. So the funding issue creates an unlikely convergence in the Cold War &ndash; in both East and West Germany, the new residential estates soon share some common features.</p>\r\n",

"<p>In the Hansaviertel district, a 17-storey tower block called the <em>Giraffe</em> soars above all the other buildings. Here, architects Klaus M&uuml;ller-Rehm and Gerhard Siegmann created apartments for single residence on each standard floor. Since half these studio apartments had a kitchenette and the other half an even smaller cupboard kitchen, the former were read as gendered female and the latter male. By 1957, such traditional roles were already outdated. Both styles of apartments attracted men and women equally.</p>\n"

"mainText": "<p>In the late 1920s, Berlin&rsquo;s chief city planner Martin Wagner commissions six architects to plan a new residential estate in the north-west of Berlin. The estate is to provide affordable housing for the workforce at the nearby Siemens production site. Between 1929 and 1934, a total of 1379 apartments are built, all with either 2 or 2.5 rooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The estate&rsquo;s six architects include four members of the <em>Der Ring</em> avant-garde association: Walter Gropius, Hans Scharoun, Otto Bartning and Hugo H&auml;ring. The other two architects involved are Fred Forb&aacute;t and Paul Rudolf Henning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Breaking with tradition</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aim is to find architectural and urban planning innovations for a modern world. The time has come to move on from perimeter block developments with their dark courtyards &ndash; the traditional approach in pre-1918 Germany. This estate sets out to create similar conditions for everyone living there &ndash; the same space and light, and an equal chance to enjoy sun and fresh air. The six architects soon agree on dividing the design of individual rows of houses between them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hans Scharoun, responsible for the estate&rsquo;s overall urban planning, proposes an entirely new style of residential estate for Berlin. With this design, he can realise his idea of a residential neighbourhood &ndash; rows of housing set in generous space and communal green areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Six individual signature styles</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strolling through the estate today, take the time to look at the individual architectural details. With each architect responsible for individual rows of houses, the details form a kind of personal signature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hans Scharoun designs the access to the estate, creating a sort of funnel of three five-storied buildings on both sides of the street. He also borrows some elements from naval architecture, such as the circular windows recalling portholes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Very different principles are applied to the two rows on the western side of the spreading estate. Here, Walter Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus, has kept to a cool functional elegance. The white block fa&ccedil;ades broken by the dark grey of the windows and the angular contours of the balconies are informed by the rationality of the New Objectivity movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Otto Bartning&rsquo;s long ribbon building stretching 338 metres is oriented east-west. The living rooms and bedrooms face south, the kitchens and bathrooms are set to the north. The plain fa&ccedil;ade is certainly not to everyone&rsquo;s taste, and locals soon nickname the building the <em>lange Jammer</em> (&lsquo;long lament&rsquo;).<strong> </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Hugo H&auml;ring&rsquo;s designs for his rows of houses, natural materials and colours play a large part, with warm brown and ochre tones harmonising with the landscaped grounds. Here, the most noticeable elements are the kidney-shaped balconies projecting from the fa&ccedil;ades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rows of houses by Fred Forb&aacute;t and Paul Rudolf Henning also bear each architect&rsquo;s own signature. On some ground floor apartments, Henning integrated terraces, underscoring the focus on fresh air and sunshine. Forb&aacute;t&rsquo;s architecture is inspired by clear lines and geometric shapes, enlivened with brick elements on the staircases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each in their own way, the six architects of the large Siemensstadt estate aspired to nothing less than optimal, modern living conditions for the contemporary age. In realising that goal, they anticipated the trends in urban design in the post-war years.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>In Berlin&rsquo;s first housing association project, architect Bruno Taut successfully applied his innovative ideas for urban architecture.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>1924 is a key year in the development of reform housing projects in Berlin. Martin Wagner, then city planner for the Sch&ouml;neberg district, calls for the introduction of a rent tax. After hyperinflation, the devaluation of mortgages leaves many landlords practically debt free. Through the rent tax they contribute to funding the housing so urgently needed in the municipality of Greater Berlin, formed just a few years before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1924 also sees work starting on Berlin&rsquo;s first inner-city housing association project. In its role as a property developer, the <em>Berliner Spar- und Bauverein</em>, a savings and building society, finds a site in the north of the city. Between 1924 and 1930, a total of 303 apartments are constructed here in three building phases .</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Neues Bauen movement in Berlin</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Schillerpark estate is not the only project of this kind. During the six years of its construction, other reform housing estates are also built, from a large estate in Britz to the &lsquo;White City&rsquo; in Reinickendorf, the Carl Legien &lsquo;residential city&rsquo; and the spreading Siemensstadt estate. Today, together with the Falkenberg Garden City, they are all inscribed as the UNESCO World Heritage Site <em>Six Berlin Modernism Housing Estates</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For its new development in Berlin&rsquo;s Wedding district, the <em>Berliner Spar- und Bauverein</em> commissions Bruno Taut. Before the First World War, Taut establishes his reputation with his plans for the Falkenberg Garden City. Now, in the Schillerpark estate, he experiments with new ground plans for semi-open blocks. The buildings are set parallel to the street and create large courtyards as in perimeter block developments, but Taut divides the rows of houses at various points to open the courtyards to the street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The traditional saddleback roofs are also out. His inspiration for the pent roofs and red brick fa&ccedil;ades comes from Holland, influenced by the Amsterdam School style of architecture. That influence can also be seen in the division of the rooms and the exterior fa&ccedil;ades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the rent tax provides the funding, it comes with conditions attached: building can be a maximum of three full storeys (excluding attic floors, which Taut also constructed here). Each apartment must also have one room of 20 sq. metres.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Attractive green spaces for life quality</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the openings to the street, the courtyards between the houses become a semi-open &lsquo;outdoor living space&rsquo;, as Taut called it. Moreover, his architecture also aims at creating a community feeling and encouraging social encounters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A high percentage of the original residents are traditional left-wing supporters. After the National Socialist seizure of power in 1933, most have to move. While some are imprisoned or held in concentration camps, the Schillerpark&rsquo;s new residents are all sympathetic to the Nazi Party.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the Second World War, the Schillerpark estate is badly damaged. In 1951, rebuilding starts overseen by Bruno Taut&rsquo;s brother Max. In the 1990s and 2000s, the buildings and landscaping are refurbished and restored.</p>\r\n",

Now, with the economic situation rapidly worsening, revenues from the tax are falling. But he still has to build more residential housing &ndash; with an especially urgent need for small flats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>More space for experiments</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using 15 million Reichsmark from current budget resources, Wagner launches a special building fund. The rent tax funding always comes with conditions. But with the new fund, architects no longer have to adhere, for instance, to rooms of a specified size or a defined floor height. With more freedom in planning, this is an attractive project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wagner commissions three architects &ndash; Wilhelm B&uuml;ning, Bruno Ahrends and Otto Rudolf Salvisberg &ndash; to construct over 1200 new apartments along Schillerpromenade (today&rsquo;s Aroser Allee) in the Reinickendorf district.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet despite the greater leeway in planning, the number one priority is still a cost-saving design. The simplest way to save money is to standardise all prefabricated structural elements such as doors, windows and staircases. The three architects also agree on 9.40 metres as the uniform depth of all the buildings.<sup> </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of these cost-saving measures also determines the appearance of the estate. With uniform plain white facades, the estate has a unique distinguishing feature. Very soon it is nicknamed the <em>Wei&szlig;e Stadt</em> &ndash; the White City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>White houses in three variations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Salvisberg is responsible for the overall urban development of the estate. His plan foresees a network of communal green spaces amid a mix of block buildings fronting the streets and rows of houses. Salvisberg&rsquo;s bridge house across today&rsquo;s Aroser Allee forms the centre of the estate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The estate&rsquo;s best-known image is still the view down this avenue. If you approach from Emmentaler Stra&szlig;e, you first see the gatehouse-like buildings designed by Ahrends. With their five storeys, they tower over the other buildings, giving the estate an almost fortress-like appearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On its four rows of columns, the 40-metre-wide bridge building by Otto Rudolf Salvisberg stands majestically in the centre of Aroser Allee. The reinforced concrete construction has a surprising elegance, seemingly almost suspended between the rows of houses to the right and left.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Architect Wilhelm B&uuml;ning focuses primarily on plans for rows of houses, positioning the rows radially in a fan-shape between Genfer Stra&szlig;e and the Schillerring. His large framed windows for the stairwells are a conspicuous feature, while the broad coloured eaves set the roofs off from the white fa&ccedil;ades.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shortly after completion, the <em>Wei&szlig;e Stadt</em> is already viewed as a successful example of a modern housing estate. Photos of the white fa&ccedil;ades are published in the international press. Damage to the buildings during the Second World War is repaired under Wilhelm B&uuml;ning from 1949 to 1954. In 2008, the Schillerpromenade estate is inscribed as UNESCO World Heritage.</p>\r\n",

"mainText": "<p>As the 1920s draw to a close, Bruno Taut is widely acknowledged in Berlin for his pioneering work. He is also chief architect for the GEHAG, a non-profit building and savings shareholding company. Berlin is constantly growing and urgently needs new housing &ndash; a perfect situation for a forward-looking, innovative architect.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Wohnstadt Carl Legien residential estate is Taut&rsquo;s last major project for social housing in Berlin. For this project, he plans exactly 1149 apartments on a relatively small site around today&rsquo;s Erich-Weinert-Stra&szlig;e. The apartments, mainly smaller units from 1.5 to 3 rooms, attract singles or couples with at most one child.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No less than four of the six Berlin Modernism estates inscribed as UNESCO World Heritage are designed by Bruno Taut &ndash; a remarkable achievement. From the mid-1920s, he experiments with novel designs for residential living outside the heavily built-up inner city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rethinking on a tight budget</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But over these years the conditions also change. Now, less building land is available &ndash; and less funding. The rent tax, introduced by city planner Martin Wagner in 1924, can no longer be earmarked just for housing projects. In 1929, in the wake of the global economic crisis, Germany&rsquo;s Chancellor Heinrich Br&uuml;ning pursues a strict austerity policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New housing projects have to adapt to the new situation. The land for the planned estate is on the margin of the inner-city area. This is expensive building land and space is limited. Taut looks for a means of connecting densely packed apartments with a feeling of openness. His solution is a space-saving block construction in a U-shape, avoiding closed courtyards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this way, his multi-storied buildings can provide an optimal number of apartments, yet still leave room for spreading green areas. Moreover, with full-width loggias &ndash; a kind of covered balcony &ndash; facing the interior spaces, every resident enjoys a view of a lawn. As in the Schillerpark estate, here too Taut takes his inspiration from the work of the Dutch architect J.J.P. Oud. Previously, a balcony in Berlin was a privilege reserved almost exclusively for well-to-do tenants in street-facing apartments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Making life colourful</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bruno Taut is no stranger to colour in his designs. Here, he applies colour again, this time to give the spatial elements a clear structure. Colour became Taut&rsquo;s trade mark &ndash; not just a simple means of design, but also very affordable. Along Erich-Weinert-Stra&szlig;e, the doors of the five-storey buildings are brightly painted in white and red or yellow, and the window frames are painted as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the buildings were repaired after the Second World War, the original colour scheme was lost. Their uniform appearance also suffered, since some tenants turned the loggias into conservatories. From the early 1990s, it has been possible to restore the original look of the estate &ndash; so now it is again just as Bruno Taut planned it.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>The Kulturforum has its roots in the West Berlin of the 1960s and 1970s &ndash; and in three buildings by two internationally renowned architects. Hans Scharoun&rsquo;s Philharmonie, opened in 1963, marked the start of a new development to the west of Potsdamer Platz. The concert hall&rsquo;s striking tent-like roof and golden fa&ccedil;ade contrast sharply with Ludwig Mies van der Rohe&rsquo;s functional form and clear lines for the Neue Nationalgalerie (New National Gallery) opened five years later.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>Looking around the open spaces at the heart of the Kulturforum, you can&rsquo;t help but notice the nineteenth-century St. Mathew&rsquo;s Church &ndash; very much a building from a different era.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A diversity of the arts</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the early 1970s, Hans Scharoun designs the Berlin State Library &ndash; the Staatsbibliothek &ndash; which opens in 1978 on the other side of Potsdamer Stra&szlig;e. The library, together with the neighbouring building housing the Ibero-American Institute (IAI), belongs to Scharoun&rsquo;s major works only finished after his death in 1972. With costs for work on constructing the State Library spiralling, the other building projects on the Kulturforum are put on hold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is some time before Edgar Wisniewski, who worked with Scharoun for many years, can finally oversee the construction of the Museum of Musical Instruments and the Chamber Music Hall, both based on Scharoun&rsquo;s original plans. The museum opens in 1984 and the Chamber Music Hall three years later in 1987 &ndash; punctually for Berlin&rsquo;s 750th anniversary celebrations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The changing face of museum architecture </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kulturform, set so close to the Wall, is a prestige project for West Berlin. It has a twofold aim &ndash; not just setting a new benchmark in the constant competition with the GDR, but also sending out a clear message to West Germany. Many art works and literature archives were taken out of Berlin for safe storage during the war. Now, though, their return is slow and sporadic. With this series of high-profile buildings, West Berlin hopes to add to the pressure to accelerate the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As early as 1965, West Berlin announces an international architectural competition for the entire Kulturforum. The expectations are high. The winning design should do nothing less than &ldquo;define the architectural essence of what a museum means for us today&rdquo;.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the jury&rsquo;s view, none of the plans realise this ambitious goal. Finally, they agree on the work of Stuttgart architect Rolf Gutbrot as a compromise solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His plans date from a time of questioning the tasks and functions of museum architecture. How do a museum and the collection it houses mutually influence one another? Which target groups are to be addressed?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gutbrodt sees his designs as a deliberate contrast to the neo-classicist and neo-baroque museums on East Berlin&rsquo;s Museum Island. Rather than intimidating visitors, his museums are intended to attract people from all walks of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By 1985, when the Museum of Decorative Arts (<em>Kunstgewerbemuseum</em>) opens, the design envisaged twenty years before seems outdated. Public reaction is muted, while the most outspoken critics condemn the building as a &ldquo;concrete bunker&rdquo;. Criticism reaches such a pitch that Gutbrod is taken off projects for the other new buildings at the Kulturforum. Yet again, it seems there is no clear plan for the Kulturforum&rsquo;s future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then Munich architects Heinz Hilmer and Christoph Sattler are commissioned to overhaul Gutbrod&rsquo;s designs for the Museum of Graphic Arts and the Art Library. They change numerous details, for instance, removing the exposed concrete pillars in the exhibition hall. The museum and Art Library are opened in 1994. Today, the fa&ccedil;ade with its concrete and clinker brink cladding seems empathically low-key.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hilmer and Sattler also designed the Gem&auml;ldegalerie, which houses an outstanding collection of European art from the thirteenth to the eighteenth century. In their plan, rather than creating prestige facades, they focused on the quality of the interior design. Their generous exhibition rooms with perfect lighting allow visitors to enjoy the Gem&auml;ldegalerie&rsquo;s exquisite collection to the full.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>Take a journey back in time to the 1950s. After the Second World War, the Gro&szlig;e Frankfurter Stra&szlig;e lies in ruins. People desperately need housing &ndash; but here other issues are at stake as well. The Cold War leaves the city divided into East and West Berlin. East Germany&rsquo;s ruling SED, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, wants to prove that the GDR has more to offer workers &ndash; not simple flats, but comfortable palaces.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>The newly constructed buildings really are luxurious. Instead of cold, cramped and unhygienic conditions in tenement flats, these apartments offer a very different life &ndash; up to 145 sq. metres of space, stuccoed ceilings, parquet floors, double windows, rubbish chutes, a bell system as well as central heating and a regular supply of warm water. The blocks also all have elevators.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>East Germany&rsquo;s showpiece project</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The boulevard between Berlin&rsquo;s Frankfurter Tor and Strausberger Platz is a major arterial road in East Berlin. It is renamed Stalinallee in 1949, and three years later becomes the site of East Berlin&rsquo;s first large-scale socialist prestige building project. This main thoroughfare is further widened to provide the grand setting needed for political rallies and military parades. The prototype apartment house is the &lsquo;Hochhaus an der Weberwiese&rsquo; tower block finished in 1951-52 and designed by Hermann Henselmann, chief architect of the new Stalinallee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Henselmann took his inspiration from the architecture popular under Stalin &ndash; Socialist Classicism and Socialist Realism. Although these styles are also influenced by neoclassicism, in particular by buildings by Prussia&rsquo;s renowned architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel, Stalinallee&rsquo;s main model comes from the residential blocks designed by Arkady Mordvinov in Moscow in the 1930s. Critics deride the monumental architecture of these Socialist Classicist tower blocks as a <em>&rdquo;wedding cake style&rdquo;.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Stalinallee project begins on 3 February 1952. Thousands of workers construct the brick-built tower blocks. Newspapers and posters in East Germany never cease to sing the praises of the buildings along Stalinallee and many people hope to move into one of these coveted flats. The GDR film <em>Die neue Wohnung</em> (The New Apartment) featured the catchy <em>Aufbau-Walzer</em> (Reconstruction Waltz), also given generous airtime on radio: &ldquo;As high as the sky, as bright as the sun / building beautiful houses, now the cranes spin round / We shout: Heave ho! Heave ho! / We put our backs into it, the houses shoot up / Heave ho! Heave ho! For our new Berlin!&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the propaganda only papers over the dissatisfaction with the economic and political situation in East Germany. In 1952 alone, 182,000 people leave the country. Initially, little changes even after Stalin&rsquo;s death on 5 March 1953. In May 1953, to accelerate the reconstruction of East Germany, the SED Politburo increases work quotas by ten percent &ndash; a decision many ordinary people see as the last straw. Across East Germany, crowds gathered to protest, not just calling for economic improvements, but also for free elections and the end of the Soviet-style SED regime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The protests escalate on 17 June 1953<strong>.</strong> The SED regime seems helpless as demonstrators take to the streets. After a few hours, Soviet tanks and troops put a violent end to the popular uprising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A prestige project in decline</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Henselmann continues to oversee construction on Stalinallee until 1958. Then the gathering wave of de-Stalinization also sweeps over the architectural sphere as well. Stalin&rsquo;s monumental statue is removed and in 1961 the grand boulevard is renamed Karl-Marx-Allee. Stalinist monumental architecture is now outmoded. The apartments still remain much sought-after, though soon the buildings begin to look dilapidated.</p>\r\n",

To realise his plan, he requests permission from the Berlin Police Commissioner to offer a &ldquo;public dance hall only for Jewish guests&rdquo;.<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Despite significantly declining sales, he manages to keep the dance hall alive until the November Pogroms in 1938.

"mainText": "<p>Even in the 1890s, the stage then close to Alexanderplatz run by brothers Anton and Donat Herrnfeld is renowned as a <em>Jargon</em> theatre offering a mix of Yiddish, German and local dialects in mostly humorous entertainment for the Berlin middle classes. In 1906, the Herrnfeld brothers build a new theatre at Kommandantenstra&szlig;e 57 near Moritzplatz. Born in Hungary, the Herrnfelds had converted from Judaism to Protestantism. In their theatre, they present farces usually in Yiddish-German dialects often set in a Jewish family and satirizing supposedly typical customs, rituals and themes. Together, they write more than 100 farces in which they often also act. As a kind of popular folk theatre, the shows attract a broad audience, both Jews and Gentiles. But these come more from the theatre-going middle-classes than the working-class residents in Kreuzberg or the areas directly around the theatre. Their farces also raise the question of how far <em>Jargon</em> theatre is anti-Semitic or at least draws on anti-Semitic stereotypes &ndash; a subject of heated critical debate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1916, after the death of his younger brother Donat, Anton Herrnfeld hands over the management of the theatre. In 1918, he sells the building to the Metropol Theatre, which renames it <em>Theater in der Kommandantenstra&szlig;e</em>. The theatre directors, though, change almost every six months. In 1932, with the global economic crisis, high rates of unemployment and falling audience numbers, the theatre has to close.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1935, Hitler&rsquo;s Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels turns the empty building into the theatre of the <em>J&uuml;discher Kulturbund </em>(Jewish Cultural Association).

"mainText": "<p>Shortly before the First World War, Caf&eacute; Moritzplatz opens in Oranienstra&szlig;e 53/54. The building, designed by Alfred Messel, initially houses the first branch of Georg Wertheim&rsquo;s department store in Berlin. But despite having an annex built, the premises for the store are soon too small. Wertheim moves to a new Moritzplatz building &ndash; today the site of the Princess Gardens. The old department store in Oranienstra&szlig;e is turned into a spacious coffee house. Caf&eacute; Moritzplatz can host over 1200 guests &ndash; and has no less than two dance bands to choose from. Its own advertising labels proudly bear the claim of being the <em>largest Concert Caf&eacute;</em>&nbsp;in the south of Berlin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In those days, these adhesive advertising labels to market products or promote causes were known as poster stamps. They could easily be glued onto parcels or put up in urban space &ndash; in a similar way to flyposting for clubs and bars today. The posh-looking man with a top hat and monocle decorating the caf&eacute;&rsquo;s advertising label is highly reminiscent of the <em>Manoli Dandy</em>, an iconic figure advertising a leading Berlin brand of cigarettes in the 1920s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manoli advertises with large illuminated signs across Berlin set high up on corner houses, the signs casting their light down the streets. One of these round advertising signs was also set directly on a corner building at Moritzplatz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The caf&eacute; boasting hot foot day and night and a large billiard hall is owned by Richard Korant, who also runs a distillery and wine shop in nearby Prinzenstra&szlig;e 82/84.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the 1920s, Caf&eacute; Moritzplatz became the <em>Triumph-Palast</em>. Later, the premises were used by a silk yarn factory.<br />\r\nIn the Second World War, the building was severely damaged in an air raid. In 1957, the ruins were demolished. The new Wertheim department store at Moritzplatz was also destroyed in the Second World War.</p>\r\n",

"introtext": "<p>In 1928, the Wertheim chain of department stores convinces the city of Berlin to change the route of its newly-planned U8 tube line. For a payment of 5 million Reichsmark (around &euro;20 million today), the department store is given a private pedestrian tunnel to the tube station at Moritzplatz. Here, Wertheim follows the example of the Karstadt department store at Berlin&rsquo;s Hermannplatz where the advantage of direct access to the tube platform attracts growing numbers of shoppers.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>The Wertheim department store&rsquo;s paramount principle is free entry without the psychological pressure to buy. In an approach just as innovative, it offers a broad range of products all on display with fixed prices payable only in cash. As if that wasn&rsquo;t enough, the store also offers customers a right to return or exchange goods &ndash; and, as the cherry on the cake, holds irresistible end-of-season sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Wertheim, buying is designed to be a delight and a pleasure. Industrial magnate (later German foreign minister) Gustav Stresemann notes that &ldquo;civil servants&rsquo; wives from the west of the city surrender themselves to this hustle and bustle just as willingly as workers&rsquo; wives from eastern Berlin, always wearing their good dress [&hellip;when they go to Wertheim].&rdquo;<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The story of the Wertheim family of entrepreneurs begins in Stralsund, on the Baltic coast. In 1885, they open their first small branch in Berlin. In 1893/94, they have their first real department store custom-built at Oranienstra&szlig;e 53/54, designed by architect Alfred Messel. With the store&rsquo;s rapid rise to fame, the premises are soon too cramped for their growing selection of tempting goods. Wertheim has to leave, and the building then becomes Caf&eacute; Moritzplatz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wertheim&rsquo;s new building, its second venue in Berlin, is directly on Moritzplatz and designed by Eugen Schmohl (1880-1926) in the new modernist style. The new department store stretches from Prinzenstra&szlig;e to Oranienstra&szlig;e with a floor space of 4,535 square metres. The architecture and layout reflects the Wertheim brothers&rsquo; vision &ndash; as much sales space as possible with the customers&rsquo; route through the store as pleasant as possible. The design, height and furnishings not only provide the requisite light and air, but are also informed by the styles in display architecture at that time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1934, a year after the Nazi Party&rsquo;s seizure of power, the Wertheim company is forced to adopt the Nazi policy of &ldquo;Aryanisation&rdquo;. To avoid the worst, Georg Wertheim hands over his entire assets to his wife Ursula, who was not classified as a Jew under the Nazi racial laws. Nonetheless, in 1935 the Nazis still categorise the Wertheim company as &ldquo;purely Jewish&rdquo;. Two years later the shareholders are expropriated, and the important and highly successful Wertheim group renamed the AWAG (Allgemeine Warenhaus AG).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Wertheim building was badly damaged in air raids during the Second World War. Until finally demolished in the early 1950s, the burnt-out shell of the building could still be seen on the corner plot of Moritzplatz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Wertheim name managed to survive the war. In wartime advertising, the name is only mentioned as an afterthought &ndash; &ldquo;AWAG formerly Wertheim&rdquo;. But after the war, a new department store is opened on Schlo&szlig;stra&szlig;e in Steglitz. As early as 1952, it bears the store&rsquo;s traditional name &ndash; <em>Wertheim</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

"mainText": "<p>Along with such popular films as <em>Das Blumenm&auml;dchen vom Moritzplatz</em> (The Flower-Girl of Moritzplatz) by Johannes Ei&szlig;ner, movie theatre operator Siegbert Goldschmidt also shows the film <em>Blondes Gift</em> (Blonde Poison), commissioning a poster by ambitious graphic artist Josef Fenneker. But soon after the film premi&egrave;res in September 1919, Berlin&rsquo;s Police President classifies <em>Blonde Poison</em> as indecent and bans it. The film tells the story of Loni, a <em>femme fatale</em> played by Hedda Vernon. Loni first brings disaster on her husband and then, when both her lovers die, shows no remorse.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TAM is part of the Establissment Buggenhagen, a large restaurant and beer garden which, in turn, belongs to the successful Aschinger-Bierquelle stock corporation. Aschinger epitomises the major league of Berlin&rsquo;s standing-only beer halls, a perfect fit for the liberal clientele at Moritzplatz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1911, in a large Establissment Buggenhagen ballroom at Oranienstra&szlig;e 147 on Moritzplatz, the <em>Union-Theater</em> movie theatre opens its doors. In August 1919, entrepreneur Siegbert Goldschmidt takes over the theatre. Goldschmidt, who also runs the well-known premiere cinema Marmorhaus on Kurf&uuml;rstendamm, extends the space to create the <em>Theater am Moritzplatz</em>, a cinema seating 783 guests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As early as 1925, Siegbert Goldschmidt&rsquo;s recurring health issues force him to give up the management of his cinema, which for a time also housed the <em>Alhambra Variet&eacute; </em>theatre. In 1928, after the cinema stands empty for nearly three years, Fritz K&auml;rger leases it and renames it the TAM &ndash; Theater am Moritzplatz.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Chamber of Commerce and Industry records, K&auml;rger employs seven musicians, six ushers and ticket sellers, a projectionist, one woman for the cloakroom and two selling candied fruit.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the global economic crisis and with the rise of the talkies, K&auml;rger closes his cinema at Moritzplatz and opens one in F&uuml;rstenwalde, outside Berlin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the meantime, Siegbert Goldschmidt is reduced to penury. Living on welfare since 1930, he is even unable to raise the money to have his company officially deregistered. He dies in February 1938 aged 64 and is buried on the Jewish Cemetery in Berlin-Wei&szlig;ensee.<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The <em>TAM</em> has a series of owners before the building is destroyed in an air raid in 1943.

"mainText": "<p>The two Aschinger brothers from southern Germany establish a chain of &ldquo;cheap and cheerful&rdquo; standing-only beer halls in Berlin. Their sixth beer hall is directly on Moritzplatz<sup>.1 </sup>Set in a corner house, the beer hall has a caf&eacute; and cake shop adjacent, both also run by Aschinger. During the Great Depression, when many Berliners have to scrimp and save to pay their rent, the Aschinger beer halls are a cheap place to keep warm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Founded in 1892 by August and Carl Aschinger, the chain of beer halls and other food outlets advances in just a few years to become the largest of its kind in Europe. They own 23 beer halls, 15 pastry and cake shops and 8 restaurants in Berlin. Aschinger also gains an international reputation. Anyone visiting the German capital is sure to &ldquo;pop into Aschinger for a snack&ldquo; before going on to the theatre or a dance hall.&nbsp;The Aschinger concept is based on fast service. In particular, it guarantees guests beer and food of reliable, constant quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That quality is carefully monitored by the Aschinger company. In the main works, food is freshly prepared every day, often using food processors developed by the Aschinger brothers themselves. In the so-called <em>Aschinger Workshop</em> on Alexanderplatz, there is even a gas-fired oven able to roast 60 geese at one time. The egg boiler may even be more impressive, designed to cook 942 boiled eggs simultaneously, yet leaving enough space so the eggs never touch. Such industrial food production methods are the only way for the Aschinger brothers to keep costs down and remain true to their vision.<sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In retrospect, they are regarded by experts as system catering pioneers. All 30 Aschinger beer halls always serve exactly the same &ndash; so Aschinger customers know just what to expect!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the Second World War, Aschinger finds it difficult to start from the ground up again. Eighty per cent of their properties are in ruins, including their branch on Moritzplatz. In 1976, their last beer hall at Zoo Station is forced to close.</p>\r\n",

Behind them, police vehicles are already moving into position. The police brutally attack the peaceful crowd, leaving many injured. Over 500 demonstrators are arrested and taken to Rummelsburg remand prison, already full to bursting. The GDR police don&rsquo;t even bother to distinguish between demonstrators and passers-by. Everyone who can escapes into the church, now both a hospital and a place of refuge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the church hall, a news information office is hastily set up. There, details and minutes from memory are collected from those injured or attacked. The pastor frees up the telephone line so it can be used as a contact number. From here, information is exchanged on the current political situation in other East German towns and cities. Leipzig, Plauen, Dresden, Magdeburg and Berlin are all peacefully campaigning, side by side, for the release of political prisoners. There are more clashes the next day. But the negotiations with the regime by church representatives and the demonstrators&rsquo; leaders start to bear fruit. On the streets the gathering crowds chant &ldquo;We are the people&rdquo; and their peaceful protests can no longer be stopped. <sup>2</sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;A peaceful revolution was something our theory never envisaged,&rdquo; said Horst Sindermann, then President of the East German Volkskammer, later. &ldquo;We simply didn&rsquo;t expect it &ndash; and it left us defenceless&rdquo;.<sup> 3 </sup></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the following weeks, the Gethsemane Church remains a main meeting point for the grass-roots opposition.

"introtext": "<p>Once the Wall falls, many people in the GDR have one wish &mdash; to stand on Berlin&rsquo;s legendary Ku&rsquo;damm boulevard! Renowned as the &lsquo;West&rsquo;s shop window&rsquo;, here they can find everything they&rsquo;ve dreamt of over the last 28 years. And so for many East Germans, their first visit to the West begins with a traffic jam.</p>\r\n",
"mainText": "<p>On 10 November 1989, the entire boulevard is packed with East German Trabbis. The colourful shop windows and neon adverts contrast sharply with the Trabbi cars in matte bali yellow, reed green and dolphin grey. Everywhere, there are throngs of people, all come to experience the wonder of western consumer goods for themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Shopping? First &ndash; a coffee!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the days after the Wall falls, Kurf&uuml;rstendamm&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kranzler Eck&rdquo; corner is buzzing &ndash; far more than for ages. For many older people in the crowds, a coffee and piece of cake in the historic Caf&eacute; Kranzler is a journey into the past. For the younger ones, just standing on Ku&rsquo;damm boulevard feels like being at the centre of the world. Suddenly, people from East and West start to dance, free and elated, to the loud music blasting from Joes Bierhaus (since 2011 the Alt Berliner Biersalon). Even those not yet able to collect their DM 100 &ldquo;welcome money&rdquo; can join in, paid for by friends or strangers in the surrounding bars and restaurants. From the sales staff in the KaDeWe department store to West Berlin students &ndash; many happily slip a DM 5 note to someone who needs it or buy them a little something, soon shared with others. On a day like this, no one is left out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Between euphoria and disenchantment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The crowds of people shift and flow from one queue to the next. The Ku&rsquo;damm shops quickly adapt to their new customers. Everywhere, improvised signs offer special actions and discount for people from East Germany &ndash; and closing times suddenly become very flexible. The day&rsquo;s fave raves turn out to be sweets, with records and clothes also high up the rankings. Everyone has their own experience with capitalism &ndash; from the first burger in a fast food chain to looking at erotic lingerie and sex toys in the Beate Uhse shop. And even those queuing for hours in vain at the bank can at least take a look around. Here and there, you also hear some critical voices. After all, the prices leave no doubts &ndash; the GDR currency is too weak for people from East Germany to fulfil their big dreams.</p>\r\n",

"<p>The &ldquo;welcome money&rdquo; scheme also attracts scamsters. With the banks packed, they first collect &ldquo;welcome money&rdquo; from one bank with their passport and then do the same at another with their ID card. But many collecting double &ldquo;welcome money&rdquo; had a bad conscience. By Christmas 1989, no less than DM 677,000 had been returned.</p>\n"

"aboutUs": "<p><strong>About Us </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>About the app</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p><em>visitBerlin&rsquo;s</em> new ABOUT BERLIN app is all about providing surprising, fascinating and interactive insights into the exciting stories that make up Berlin&rsquo;s eventful history. It presents places and events that highlight the city&rsquo;s struggles for freedom. Places where people have taken their fate into their own hands, made a stand, hoped for a better future. And places that remind us of times when terror and oppression reigned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To create the app, <em>visitBerlin</em> worked with the Centre for Contemporary History (ZZF) in Potsdam to select more than 200 key locations. Each location provides a fresh opportunity to tell users about people&rsquo;s lives in Berlin in different eras. The stories span the period from 1871 to the present day and look ahead to the future. More fascinating stories about Berlin will be added as time goes on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Historians and journalists have played a vital role in the creation of the new app. ABOUT BERLIN combines historical accuracy with outstanding storytelling, taking the user on a personal journey of discovery that reveals Berlin&rsquo;s eventful history.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Our mission &ndash; to make the world fall in love with Berlin</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Promoting Berlin around the world.</strong> As Berlin&rsquo;s official organisation for tourism and event marketing, <em>visitBerlin</em> is constantly coming up with new ideas to promote the German capital &ndash; one of Europe&rsquo;s top 3 tourist destinations after London and Paris &ndash; on a global level. <em>visitBerlin</em> is powered by 200 creatives, market managers, journalists, sales experts and service providers. We inspire people to discover the city and its culture, people, atmosphere and lifestyles. How? By telling <strong>the story of </strong>Berlin, the<strong> </strong>city of freedom &ndash; <strong>from walled city to </strong><strong>world city.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This app is supported by the Berlin Senate Department for Economics, Energy and Business as part of its tourism plan.</p>\r\n",

Whenever you access our App, we collect the following data which is technically necessary for us to display the App to you:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Our visited App</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Date and time accessed</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Quantity of data sent in bytes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Operating system used</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- IP address used (if necessary in anonymised form)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- GPS data or other telephone-related location data (e.g. via WLAN or Bluetooth), with express consent</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Processing takes place as per article 6(1)(f) GDPR on the basis of our legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality of our App. Data is not transferred or used in any other way.

Some of the cookies used by us are deleted once you finish using the App, i.e. when you close the App (session cookies). Other cookies remain on your mobile device and enable us or our partner companies (cookies of third-party providers) to recognise your mobile device again on your next visit (persistent cookies). When cookies are stored, they collect and process individually determined user data like location data and IP address values. Persistent cookies are automatically deleted after a specified period which can differ depending on the cookie. If personal data is also processed as a result of cookies individually implemented by us, processing takes place either as per article 6(1)(b) GDPR to execute the contract or article 6(1)(f) GDPR to maintain our legitimate interests in the best possible functionality of the App and a customer-friendly and effective design when visiting the App.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We cooperate under certain circumstances with advertising partners who help us make our App offering more appealing to you.

If we cooperate with such advertising partners, you are individually and separately informed in the paragraphs below of the use of such cookies and the scope of the data collected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may prevent storage of cookies by means of the appropriate setting in your device software; we draw your attention, however, to the fact that you will in such case not be able to fully use all the functions of this App.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4) Making contact</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Personal data is collected when you make contact with us (e.g. by contact form or email). What data is collected when you use a contact form is apparent from the contact form itself. Such data is stored and used exclusively for the purpose of answering your query or for making contact and the associated technical administration. The legal basis for processing data is our legitimate interest in answering your query as per article 6(1)(f) GDPR. If you make contact with a view to concluding a contract, the additional legal basis for processing is article 6(1)(b) GDPR. Your data is deleted once processing of your query has been completed; this is the case if it emerges from the circumstances that the matter in question has been definitively clarified and deletion is not prevented by any legal retention obligations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5) Location data</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We require access to the location of your device. In the event of a query, we collect your current location via GPS in order to be able to rapidly give you information on your immediate environment. Data on your location is used only for processing your query. Your location data is transmitted via an encrypted connection. Your location data is anonymised once your query has been completed and is statistically interpreted to improve our service. Collected GPS data in no way makes it possible to draw conclusions about you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the App has been started, you are asked as part of its installation to actively share your location data with <em>visitBerlin</em>. Sharing location data with <em>visitBerlin</em> may be switched off for the future after the initial installation process at any time in the settings under the point share location data with <em>visitBerlin</em>. After share location data with <em>visitBerlin </em>has been deactivated, location data can no longer be shared with <em>visitBerlin</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6) Web analysis services</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.1 Google Universal Analytics and Firebase</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Google Universal Analytics</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This App uses Google Universal Analytics, a web analysis service provided by Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (&lsquo;Google&rsquo;). Google Universal Analytics uses cookies, text files which are stored on your mobile device and enable use of the App by you to be analysed. The data obtained by the cookie on your use of this App (including the shortened IP address) is usually transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This App uses Google Universal Analytics exclusively with the extension &lsquo;_anonymizeIp()&rsquo;, which ensures anonymisation of the IP address by shortening and prevents persons from being directly identified. As a result of the extension, your IP address is first shortened by Google within member states of the European Union or in other states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases is the full IP address transmitted to a Google server in the USA and stored there. In such exceptional cases such processing takes place as per article 6(1)(f) GDPR on the basis of our legitimate interest in the statistical analysis of user behaviour for optimisation and marketing purposes. Google will use such data on our behalf to interpret your use of the App, to compile reports on usage activities and to provide us with other services connected with App and internet use. The IP address transmitted by the App within the framework of Google Universal Analytics is not combined by Google with other data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may prevent storage of cookies by means of the appropriate setting in your device software; we draw your attention, however, to the fact that you will in such case not be able to fully use all the functions of this App. You may also choose not to grant permission to collect when first starting the App or to deactivate for the future any permission already granted for Google tracking services within the App in its settings via the point Google tracking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This App uses Google Universal Analytics for cross-device analysis of visitor streams conducted via a user ID.

Tracking is switched off by storing an opt-out cookie on your system. If you delete all your cookies at once, you should note that the opt-out cookie is also lost and that it would if necessary have to be replaced again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We currently use Google Universal Analytics and Google Analytics for Firebase/Firebase Analytics cookies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To opt out for Google Universal Analytics, please click <a href=\"http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en\">here</a>. If it is not possible to deactivate Google Analytics for your mobile device with the Google plugin, please use this <a href=\"http://www.visitberlin.de/en/article/privacystatement#gaOptOut\">link</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You are also requested when starting the App to activate Google tracking services in the appropriate setting. As an alternative to the above opt-out option for Google Universal Analytics, you can for the future switch off the tracking service after the initial installation process at any time within the App in the settings under the point Google tracking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8) Social plugins</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use of Facebook, Google+, Twitter and Instagram plugins</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In our App social plugins (&lsquo;plugins&rsquo;) are used from the Facebook and Google+ social networks and the Twitter and Instagram microblogging services.

The content of the plugin is transmitted by the Provider in question directly to the App and integrated into the page. By incorporating the plugins, the Providers receive information that you have accessed the corresponding page in our App even if you do not have a profile or are not logged in. Such information (including your IP address) is transmitted by the App directly to a server of the Provider in question in the USA and stored there.
