",,,"Titanic in the newspaper district
Dynamic and sensational - that's the plan for the newspaper headquarters. Newspaper tycoon Rudolf Mosse's new advertising-based business model turned his publishing company into a rich, powerful concern. Now his son-in-law and successor, Hans Lachmann-Mosse, is dreaming of designing a new headquarters that will be an architectural flagship for this successful publishing empire.

The prestigious building on the corner of Jerusalemer Straße was built in 1901 but severely damaged during the Spartacist uprising of January 1919. Mosse decides it should not be merely renovated, but radically rebuilt. He hires young architect Erich Mendelsohn to draw up the plans. His designs are bold and futuristic, an expression of the new, fast-paced age. Mendelsohn adds two storeys of modern steel-reinforced concrete to the original sandstone building and creates a streamlined, curved corner with wide glass windows. The building reflects the movement of people and traffic on the street below. Mendelsohn has given the building wings! The frontage protrudes over the street corner like the bow of a ship. Puffing out its chest, it proudly sets sail for new horizons. The building work begins in late 1921, but the construction is not allowed to interfere with editorial operations. Relocating or temporarily suspending operations is unthinkable for a major publishing house like Mosse. 

Death comes from above 

As the building work nears completion, disaster strikes out of the blue. On the morning of 24 January 1923, the upper floor suddenly collapses. Great piles of gravel and cement were being stored on the newly concreted roof. They soak up the rain during the night and their weight causes the upper floor to cave in. An avalanche of rubble sweeps through eight storeys, destroying everything in its path. On the fourth floor it picks up a heavy metal cabinet, which crashes down on the unsuspecting staff working in the newspaper offices below. 

When the dust settles, 13 employees are dead and 11 others are seriously injured. Reporting on the disaster in their own offices, stunned journalists from the Berliner Tageblatt newspaper describe hearing cries for help from the piles of rubble and iron girders, which have been ""bent like matchsticks by the sheer force of the catastrophe"". An editorial secretary recounts how women and men struggled out of the building, ""panic-stricken, dust-covered and with a look of horror on their faces"". A gaping, ten-metre hole now splits the Mossehaus from roof to basement.  

The Mosse steamship 

In the court case that follows, nine men from the construction company are charged with causing manslaughter and bodily harm due to criminal negligence. A master builder is jailed for six months, while two foremen receive two-month sentences. Their sentences are reduced because of inadequate regulations and their lack of experience with the materials involved. Despite the tragedy, Mendelsohn's building is hailed as an architectural triumph: ""The good ship Rudolf Mosse is steaming down Jerusalemer Straße"". 
",,"The building is badly damaged by fire during the Second World War and later finds itself in the shadow of the Wall in East Berlin. It survives with rudimentary restoration work until it is finally rebuilt to Mendelsohn's original design in 1992. But its surroundings are now very different. The building is dwarfed by a new publishing empire - the Axel Springer Verlag.

",,,"Sex is relative
A German Jewish scientist living and working in Berlin in the 1920s, renowned the world over and respected for his research - does that remind you of anyone? It might first sound like acknowledged genius Albert Einstein, but it equally applies to sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld, a pioneer of gender studies and icon of the gay movement.

Tolerance instead of homophobia 

In the contemporary American press, physician Markus Hirschfeld is dubbed the ""Einstein of sex"". His own motto is the far less sensational ""Justice through Science"". Hirschfeld dedicates his life to researching love and sexuality, its techniques and practices, and diversity and extremes. In early July 1919, to further his research, Hirschfeld founds his Institute of Sexual Research - a previously unimaginable institution seeking to fight prejudice with science and homophobia with information. 

The Institute itself takes an approach as diverse as the categories of sexual intermediary which Hirschfeld defines. The researchers include biologists, forensic scientists, gynaecologists and anthropologists all working under one roof. These include, for instance, respected psychiatrist Arthur Kronfeld, who offers consultations, or his successor, dermatologist Bernhard Schapiro, who experiments with remedies against impotence, or physician and sex educator Max Hodann who offers sex counselling. The Institute not only treats venereal disease, hormone disorders and potency problems, but also offers marriage counselling, seminars and consultancy services.  

The Institute also carries out surgical sex change operations. In the second half of the 1920s, in addition to its programme of medical care, the Institute increasingly takes on an active public role. The educational programme includes sex education films, advice evenings on contraception as well as group tours through the library and archive.  

Hirschfeld's work in sex education is often fiercely condemned, and he himself is repeatedly the victim of verbal and physical violence. At the same time, the call for sexual reform also attracts illustrious guests. The evening events in the Institute's rooms are attended by Dada artists, writers, dancers and philosophers such as André Gide, Christopher Isherwood, Anita Berber and Walter Benjamin. Film director Sergei Eisenstein is said to have visited, as well as the elderly playwright and writer Gerhart Hauptmann. 

A vanished location 

The former site of the Institute of Sexual Research is now almost forgotten in Tiergarten. The Institute once stood at the intersection of the two streets In den Zelten/Beethovenstraße, but both have long since disappeared. Since 1957, this area has been the site of Berlin's former Congress Hall, since 1989 the Haus der Kulturen der Welt cultural centre. Hirschfeld's Institute was east of here, located in a triangle formed by the venue Tipi am Kanzleramt and the Federal Chancellery. There, in one of the best locations, it was housed in two town mansions linked by a central corner house set slightly back from the pavement. The interiors were inspired by an elegant classicism.  

Today, there are sites commemorating Hirschfeld's life and work directly in the vicinity. If you follow the curve of the River Spree to the west toward Bellevue Palace, you find a rust-coloured memorial column just a five-minute walk away, directly opposite the boat jetty. On the other river bank, a path is named after Magnus Hirschfeld close to a memorial for the first homosexual emancipation movement.
",,"In 1930, Magnus Hirschfeld sets off on a world trip - but he never returns to Berlin. In a Paris cinema, he sees newsreels showing the National Socialists looting his Institute and burning his library. His attempt to set up a new Institute abroad fails. Hirschfeld dies in Nice in exile in 1935.

",,,"The leap to freedom
Border guard Conrad Schumann sucks nervously on his cigarette. Onlookers on the West Berlin side of the barbed wire call out: Go on! Jump! But the 19-year-old is wavering. Should he risk his life to be free?

On 13 August 1961 soldiers began sealing off free passage between East and West Berlin. Now, two days later, a special task force is guarding the start of construction work on the wall that will split the city in two. Millions of East Germans have already fled to the West since 1945. Now the SED regime is putting a stop to this, even though their leader, Walter Ulbricht, said the exact opposite just two months earlier. 

On this day, 15 August 1961, Conrad Schumann is one of the men guarding the temporary barbed wire border that has been erected on Bernauer Straße. He is in charge of two other officers, Erich Fierus and Peter Kröger. But while these two are conscientiously carrying out their duties, Schumann has the scent of freedom. The pavement on Bernauer Straße is in West Berlin. Just a leap away. Just one leap. 

Everything seems possible  

But Conrad Schumann still hesitates. Behind the barbed wire, the volume increases. Photographers, cameramen, onlookers - everyone is calling out to him. Some are hurling insults, calling him a ""Russian lackey""; others are urging him to flee. Schumann lights another cigarette. The barbed wire fence is low. Fierus and Kröger are carrying ammo, but it is safely stowed in their pockets. Everything seems possible.  

Just a stone's throw away, in the Western part of the city, a cluster of photographers includes young photojournalist Peter Leibing. A cub reporter with the Conti-Press agency, he has been keeping his eye on the soldier with the cigarette. Onlookers tell Leibing that they have seen him pressing down the barbed wire. Checking the border is safe? Or preparing to escape? Peter Leibing stands and waits.  

Conrad Schumann knows that if he jumps he might never see his family again. But if Ulbricht's ""anti-imperialist wall"" goes up, he may be trapped in East Germany forever. 

Leibing is an expert with moving targets   

Peter Leibing senses that something is about to happen. He trains his East-German-made camera on the soldier. With its 200-mm telephoto lens, this Exacta camera can capture anything. He has often taken photos at show jumping tournaments, so he knows how to photograph a moving target.  

When Fierus and Kröger move away, Conrad Schumann takes his run-up and leaps over the fence, dropping his Kalashnikov in the process. Peter Leibing captures the iconic image that flashes around the world. The escaping border guard becomes the worst PR nightmare of the SED regime. The photo was added to UNESCO's Memory of the World programme in 2011. 

Schumann later married, had a child, and moved to Oberemmendorft in Bavaria. But he never lost his fear of Stasi retribution. When the Berlin Wall came down, he said: ""Only since 9 November 1989 have I felt truly free."" In 1998 Conrad Schumann was found hanging in his barn. It seems he never escaped his fear of the GDR's secret police.
",,"US President Ronald Reagan invited Conrad Schumann to join the   celebrations to mark Berlin's 750th anniversary in 1987. Schumann and his wife Gunda were sitting on the podium when Reagan said his famous words at the Brandenburg Gate: ""Mr Gorbachev, tear down this wall"".

The sound of children's laughter. The satisfying thwack when a leather football is perfectly struck. Gooooooaaaaaalllll! The cry rings out in English - with Arab, Syrian, Portuguese and German accents.

 

It's summertime in Berlin. The hot, sticky air hangs between the apartment blocks. Where you're standing is the only place you can catch a breath of wind - a green oasis of northern Berlin between the Weißensee Academy of Art, the once-deserted office buildings and the refugee shelter. This conquest of no man's land began with a project initiated by the art academy: ""What shall we do with all the empty space in Berlin?"" A group of students mulled over this question during the 2015 summer term. They came up with the bermudagarten, a garden on a patch of wasteland created with and for the refugees who are temporarily housed in the area. The opening ceremony is held at the DGZ-Ring, a local authority office in Weißensee. The Berlin daily taz describes the project as ""an important social project"".  The students used to call this desolate patch of land the Bermuda Triangle, so bermudagarten seems like an obvious choice of name. 

A garden without borders 

Rocket and radishes, beans and beer are now the order of the day in this multicultural community garden. In the evenings, students and refugees, locals and free-thinkers gather for a chat around the raised beds. They use a mixture of words and sign language, have a laugh, and sometimes are happy to just sit in silence. Sometimes the students show a film - often starring Charlie Chaplin because silent films have no ""language barriers"". They teach the kids to draw and the refugees teach the students to cook. The air is full of exotic aromas. Now and then, music floats across the former no man's land. The garden is open to anyone who wants to help with the gardening and be part of the project.  

A green Utopia 

It's the summer of 2025, ten years after the project began. The once temporary garden is now a permanent feature. The former wasteland has become a green oasis in the heart of the city. The tomatoes are glowing red on the vine, the raspberries are ripe for picking, and the cucumber plants are inching their way up the pergola. Every gardener decides for themselves what they want to grow. 

The local children can escape the confines of their small apartments and race around to their hearts' content. The bermudagarten is a place of freedom and self-expression. As the sun slowly sets, the smell of charcoal, cevapcici and gyros blends with the sounds of Arabic, Syrian, Portuguese and German. Then someone grabs a football and a kickabout starts.

",,,"The GDR shows off its international mindset
In 1968, designer Erich John is drawing filigree black lines on the white pages of a desk diary. A chaotic-looking drawing emerges, with a cylinder-shaped motif repeating itself underneath. John is taking part in a design competition commissioned by the East German government. At the time, he has no idea that his sketches will produce a Berlin icon.

A socialist-style redesign 

In the late Sixties, Alexanderplatz (Alex) is given a complete overhaul. Like Moscow's Red Square, it is to be Berlin's central square for staging major events - such as the GDR's fast-approaching 20th anniversary. The icing on the cake is provided by a competition to build a new Urania column - the original was an advertising column with a clock, built by the Urania watch factory.  

The designer Erich John is one of 20 entrants in the competition. The final selection takes place in Monbijoupark in Berlin-Mitte. When John is called forward, he presents his idea to the jury. ""They were bowled over"", he recounts in an interview in 2010.  

Erich John had been an industrial designer for many years. Between 1955 and 1992 he designed all kinds of products, from radio receivers to shavers, microscopes to drills. For Alex, he designed a symbol of cosmopolitanism and technological progress: the World Clock.  

John describes how it works: ""My design replaces the hour hand with an hour ring that moves the hours (...) through the 24 time zones. The time zone panels are engraved with the names of more than 150 cities around the world. The planetary system that circles above it references how time is linked to what is happening in space, but here (...) it acts as a minute hand. One turn equals one minute."" 

A cosmopolitan symbol in the GDR 

It sounds complicated, but it causes quite a stir among the jury. John wins the competition, but deadlines are tight, and materials are hard to come by in the GDR. Special permits are needed, and the Feierabendbrigaden are called in - bands of workers who work for cash-in-hand alongside their official jobs. The building work is hampered by bad weather and lack of resources. But nine months later, the 16-tonne World Clock is finished - just in time for the GDR's 20th birthday. It officially opens on 30 September 1969.  

It survives the fall of the Berlin Wall and German reunification and is listed as a historical monument in 2015. It still works perfectly. When you admire the iconic postcard motif on Alexanderplatz, you'd be justified in asking why a state that deprived citizens of their freedom wanted a cosmopolitan symbol? It was certainly a paradox during the GDR regime, but today it is in tune with the times. ""I never expected it to be such a hit"", says John.
",,"Incredible, but true: there's a Trabant in the World Clock! The hour ring is driven by an electric motor with a converted Trabant transmission. It dates from GDR times and is buried in a bunker two metres below ground. The Trabi engine is still running smoothly.

",,,"Massacre at the Reichstag
Tuesday afternoon, 13 January 1920. AEG's production workshops stand empty, nobody is manning the machinery at Daimler and workers at Siemens have downed tools. More than 100,000 Berlin workers are on the march. They gather in front of the Reichstag on Platz der Republik.

The workers are responding to calls from the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany (USPD), the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) and the Berlin trade unions to demonstrate against the proposed new Works Council Act. They want the councils to give them more say. The demonstrators are carrying banners saying: ""Ebert, keep your promise!"" and waving red flags. Officials make speeches on a stage in front of the steps of the Reichstag. 

The situation escalates at the Victory Column 

Police chief Eugen Ernst is standing at Portal II on the south side of the parliament building, surrounded by some of his 300 officers. He watches nervously as the situation starts to escalate. The job of the security police is to protect the members of the Reichstag, who are currently discussing the proposed new Works Council Act. No one is allowed into the Reichstag, and that includes a delegation of demonstrators. Some SPD members of the Reichstag are heckled as they make their way into the building. 

Around 3pm, one or two demonstrators try to incite the crowd to push up the huge flight of steps in front of the West Portal. Fights break out at the Bismarck Memorial as they move ever closer to the entrance. Some of the police lose their handguns. They had earlier tried to calm the tense situation by removing the machine guns, but now they reinstall them here and at the South Portal. One demonstrator fires towards the entrance with a stolen weapon. He is knocked to the ground by his fellow protesters. 

Politicians debate while people are dying 

Suddenly the rat-a-tat of a machine gun rings out. Hand grenades explode. The police open fire. On the south side of Simsonstraße, today's Scheidemannstraße, several people fall to the ground under a hail of bullets. Locksmith Otto Heinig is one of the victims, hit by a bullet to the head. Worker Reinhold Höpfner is killed by a shot to the neck. The crowd starts to flee as the gunfire continues. In the end, 42 people, including a policeman, lose their lives. 105 people are also injured, some seriously. 

At first the politicians inside the Reichstag are unaware of what is happening outside. However, USPD representative Fritz Zubeil, watches the massacre unfold from the entrance and runs into the chamber, calling for the debate to be stopped. Reichstag President Constantin Fehrenbach suspends the sitting several times. In the meantime, the dead and injured are carried into the Reichstag and laid in the corridors. When the Reichstag eventually votes against stopping the debate, a riot breaks out. USPD members chant ""enough, enough, enough.""  Fehrenbach finally suspends the sitting when he realises the seriousness of the situation. 

People are quick to blame the USPD, who they believe provoked the massacre. But it's still unclear to this day why the police decided to shoot and whether they fired any warning shots. The Works Council Act is finally passed and shatters the council movement's hopes of establishing a soviet-style republic in Germany.

Summer 1943, a few minutes past midnight. In the darkness, a deathly hush hangs over the Jewish cemetery in Weißensee, along with the scent of moss and freshly turned soil. Suddenly there's a rustling sound. A group of people emerge from the darkness and hurry across the cemetery. One of them stumbles over a fallen gravestone. They stop in front of a magnificent mausoleum, climb onto its roof, lift a glass plate and slip inside. They have found a safe place to spend the night.

The largest Jewish cemetery in Europe 

You're standing in front of that very tomb. One of Berlin's greatest singers, opera star Joseph Schwarz, is buried here. It is one of the 116,000 graves that make Weißensee cemetery the largest Jewish cemetery in Europe.  

Berlin's Jewish community established the cemetery in 1880. Simple graves stand next to magnificent mausoleums. Some of them have been designed by famous architects such as Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius. It is also the final resting place of many well-known Berliners, including department store founders Adolf Jandorf (KaDeWe) and Hermann Tietz (Hertie), hotelier Berthold Kempinski and publishers Samuel Fischer and Rudolf Mosse. These names reflect the confidence and assimilation of Berlin's Jews in the imperial era.  

Walk past the tomb on the right and follow the narrow path between the graves and bushes. Turn left after 250 metres. This is the burial place of Jewish soldiers who fell in the First World War. This is also where young Harry Kindermann and his friends used to run around after a ball in the early 1940s. Really? A game of football among the gravestones? Rabbi Kindermann doesn't mind the boys running around. The cemetery is the size of 60 football pitches and it's one of the few places where they can run around in safety. The streets of Berlin are too dangerous. Harry spends much of his childhood in the cemetery. The children can eat wild plums and apricots from the trees that grow there. 

Looking back, Harry has fond memories of the place that allowed him to play, laugh and fall in love for the first time. And hide - like in that tomb. Under the Nazis, Jews escaped persecution by hiding in the mausoleums. Sometimes they stayed one night, sometimes several days.  

Surviving the war and the surrender 

The Weißensee cemetery never closes. It was one of the few institutions in Germany that remained in the hands of the Jewish community during the Nazi era. War-time air raids on Berlin damaged around 4,000 graves and destroyed the plant nursery and the new hall of remembrance. But the cemetery survived. Three days after the war ended, the Jewish community was once again holding religious services at the Jewish cemetery in Weißensee.

",,,"Line 1:  A subway line travels around the world
""Cats - I can't imagine anything more boring""  Volker Ludwig, director of the GRIPS Theatre in Berlin, has very clear ideas about what he thinks makes a good show. His past success suggests he knows what he's talking about. No German musical has ever had more international success than Line 1, apart from Brecht's Threepenny Opera. Yet it all started with a bet!

The musical Line 1 is a tribute to Berlin, a homage to the down-at-heel, a declaration of love to the lower classes of the divided city. And since its premiere on 30 April 1986, it has become the most-staged German musical ever. 

The birthplace of this successful show was the GRIPS children's and youth theatre in Berlin's Mitte district. Theatre director Volker Ludwig explains how many of its shows since 1975 have been accompanied by rock musicians. But there was one time when he used recorded music, and the musicians complained bitterly. ""To mollify them, I bet them I could write a musical with 20 songs that would give them lots to do."" 

From experiment to export hit 

No sooner said than done! Ludwig pulls together a bunch of existing storylines from his repertoire and gives them a completely new setting on a subway line. The rest of the plot writes itself: ticket inspectors, a tour through different districts of Berlin, some weird and wonderful people, the Wall - and a country girl in search of romance. At first no-one imagines that this simple story will turn out to be such a huge success. 

The actors are sceptical and composer Birger Heymann is even a little embarrassed by the song he writes for the show called Hey du, 'Hey you'. But he's paid a nice compliment when, many years later, it's covered by rapper Sido and punk band the Beatsteaks.  

After its premiere, the musical gets a lukewarm reception and poor reviews. But after Germany's reunification Ludwig is awarded the Mülheim Dramatist Prize at the prestigious Mülheim Theatre Festival and things really start to really take off. Line 1 is performed in 150 venues around the German-speaking world and also becomes an international hit. The famous subway line travels all the way to Vienna, New York and even South Korea. 

Line 1 features universal characters 

Ludwig's favourite version of Line 1 is the one performed in Seoul. He says Kim Min-Ki, the ""Korean Bob Dylan"" was fascinated by the idea and decided to adapt it for his own country.  He kept the original music but changed the characters to reflect life in Korea, so the widows of Wilmersdorf became the widows of dictators.  

This is exactly what audiences like about Line 1 -  it doesn't have to be set in Berlin. Ludwig says: ""I've created a typical city panopticon that reflects every major city in the world."" 

During your stay in Berlin, why not head for the GRIPS Theatre and hop on Line 1? You'll be treated to three hours of great entertainment that's a far cry from Cats.

The steam escapes with a loud hiss. The train blows its whistle and sounds its horn. With a metallic screech, the wheels ease forward on the tracks. Picking up speed, the train clickety-clacks its way from Berlin to Erkner. The members of the Durch! literary society are celebrating its first anniversary by visiting writer Gerhart Hauptmann for dinner.

After a series of false starts as a a sculptor, draughtsman and historian, Hauptmann is now embarking on a literary career. This subsequent winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature reads aloud to his guests from Bahnwärter Thiel (Signalman Thiel) a novel that is now considered a seminal work of the Naturalism movement. 

Impressed, the members of Durch! head home after the reading. Artistic differences lead to the break-up of the society within the year, but two of its members who were on that train - Wilhelm Bölsche and Bruno Wille - are still looking to shake things up. Around 1890 they settle by the lake at Friedrichshagen am Müggelsee, where they begin to attract like-minded writers and artists to their Friedrichshagen Writers' Circle.  

Free spirits gather at the Müggelsee  

You're standing outside house number 254. This is where a loose association of free spirits has formed, coming together regularly to share their views and ideas. Behind this façade with the memorial plaque to Wilhelm Bölsche, the first female winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Bertha von Suttner, can be found deep in conversation with the founder of anthroposophy, Rudolf Steiner. Meanwhile Frank Wedekind, the author of Frühlings Erwachen (Spring Awakening), might be found debating with German-Jewish writer Else Lasker-Schüler or the groundbreaking Swedish author August Strindberg. The Haus am See provides these leading thinkers and other friends of Bölsche and Wille with the perfect environment for developing their ideas - ideas that will have a lasting impact on society.  

The Circle's members follow the principles put forward by the Life Reform Movement, a broad coalition of groups that takes a critical view of industrialisation and urbanisation and promotes a return to a more natural way of life. These liberal ideas have an impact, with members of the Friedrichshagen group setting up the Neue Gemeinschaft, an anarchistic, communist community at the Schlachtensee. Germany's first vegetarian community also emerges from the circle of friends who meet at the Müggelsee. At the turn of the 20th century, a community known as Eden opened its doors in Oranienburg and began supplying vegetarian products to large Berlin kitchens. Here in Friedrichshagen, the friends come together to discuss and debate free religion, naturopathy, rural communities, new kinds of education...  the list goes on. They also put pen to paper, with Bölsche's book Liebesleben in der Natur (Love Life in Nature) proving to be a hit, particularly among the working class.

They have barely hung their homemade Allied flags at the windows and come to terms with their Soviet occupiers when a new Allied power arrives on the scene.

On 12 August 1945, the French are the last of the four Allies to take control of their Berlin sector - the districts of Reinickendorf and Wedding. But it soon becomes clear that the new occupiers will not be adopting a policy of laissez-faire. French commander General Geoffrey de Beauch&ecirc;sne issues a clear decree: ""France harbours no thoughts of revenge, but demands strict discipline and help from the local population in eliminating the Nazi regime.""  There will be no retaliation, but not everyone likes the ensuing crackdown. Whenever the Tricolour is raised, they have to stand to attention and remove their hat.  

Some of Reinickendorf's residents are forced out of their homes to make way for the French administration, and houses and apartments are requisitioned. The French sector commander says these seizures are just a fraction of what the Germans appropriated in France during the war. 

Vive la France in Reinickendorf  

The problem is exacerbated when the army families move in. Accommodation is scarce in bombed-out Berlin. In 1952, the French decide to convert Camp Foch, which previously housed French gendarmes, into a complex called Cité Foch. It is turned into apartments, a church, cinema, swimming pool, schools and a shopping centre and the street streets are blue, just like in France. In 1991 Cité Foch houses 2,600 French army personnel and their families but is closed to civilians. The sealed-off complex with elegant street names such as Rue Montesquieu also houses military facilities, including a listening station with transmitter mast on Cyclopstrasse/Rue Montesquieu and the Berlin-Waidmannslust radio station.  

From très chic to très triste  

In the early years, the shopping centre proves popular with the occupying powers, and Soviet officers also come here to buy their wine. Architecturally, Cité Foch has been designed very much with function in mind. When the French move out, much of the complex falls into disrepair and is demolished, apart from a few residential buildings. Today, a new Cité Foch is being built - but it still has the blue-and-white street signs with their melodious names.

"Genslerstraße 66, 13055 Berlin",52.541886,13.500248,History,1,FALSE,Berlin-Hohenschönhausen Memorial,"Rudolf Bahro takes the liberty of saying the GDR has failed - and ends up behind bars
",,,"The GDR's most explosive manuscript
When Swiss musicologist Harry Goldschmidt crosses from East to West Berlin in December 1976 he doesn't arouse any particular suspicion. The East German border guards simply allow him to pass. But in fact he has something explosive in his bag - a manuscript that, just a few months later, will blow the lid of the GDR regime.

On 22 August 1977, part of the smuggled text is printed in Spiegel magazine under the title The Alternative - A Critique of Actually Existing Socialism. On the same day, the East German philosopher Rudolf Bahro admits to being the author of the piece.  

In his book, Bahro is extremely critical of the GDR, which he says is still a class-based society. He describes the SED apparatus as a ""machine that is totally cut off from the people"" and calls for a new revolution. Never before has an East German citizen written such a scathing indictment of the regime. On the evening of 22 August, ARD and ZDF broadcast a recorded interview with Bahro. Suddenly ""actually existing socialism"" comes under massive fire in the Western media.  

Bahro is known to the Stasi 

The next day Bahro is arrested and taken to Berlin's Hohenschönhausen prison. He has been on the Stasi's radar for some time. He first came to the attention of the secret service as a student when he criticised the SED regime's position on the popular uprising in Hungary. Later on, he spoke out in support of the Prague Spring. 

But it's only when his Alternative is published that the author finally ends up in jail. He always knew it was coming: ""I've had almost ten years to prepare for this moment of truth. I'm not going to be the victim. I'm the one who attacks. Fortunately I was able to choose my moment."" 

Behind bars, Rudolf Bahro is unaware that he is experiencing a huge groundswell of support in the West. Writers such as Heinrich Böll and Günter Grass are coming to his defence, the first print run of his book sells out before it even hits the shelves in September 1977, and translations of are already in the pipeline. In the GDR The Alternative fails to cause a ripple - the regime makes sure of that.  

A new law is passed to deal with Bahro  

But when it comes to Bahro's trial, East Germany's leaders realise they have a problem. It's not actually a criminal offence to publish a political book in the GDR, so they pass a brand new law on intelligence-gathering so that they can try the dissident. The next problem is that the new law refers specifically to passing secrets directly to a ""class enemy"". But Bahro's manuscript was handed to the German Trade Union Confederation's publishing house, not to the West German government.  

But where there's a will there's a way, the author was found guilty and his lawyer Gregor Gysi was unable to keep him out of prison. On 11 October 1979 - the 30th anniversary of the founding of the GDR - the state deports its fiercest critic to the West. In 1990 The Alternative is published for the first time in East Germany. It is now a country on the brink of collapse. Soon after, the state that Rudolf Bahro once criticised so harshly is consigned to history.

",,,"The voice of the free world goes out to all of Berlin
It's an ordinary Saturday afternoon in 1973. As the sound of Carlos Santana's guitar fades away, the RIAS presenter announces that it's time for some dedications from listeners in the GDR: ""(...) We've had a letter from Robin Gibb II. He'd like to say hello to the Prince and Princess, the Lord Nightcap Keeper, the Church Tower Clock and the Church Tower Clock Hand, Mother Silvia and all the fans at Hansi's."" 

These weird-sounding names are, of course, all aliases. They're a way for people in the East to get in touch with their friends and relatives in the West. And who is the messenger? Radio in the American Sector, or RIAS for short. 

Soon after the end of the war, the American occupying forces set up a radio station in West Berlin. It's run by two Americans, but the artistic director and most of the staff are German.  

The ears, eyes and voice of the city 

You're standing in front of the Funkhaus, where RIAS begins broadcasting in 1948. But its reporters are everywhere. During the Berlin blockade of 1948 to 1949, RIAS try to buoy up the city's residents by sending loudspeaker vans out on the streets. The station broadcasts Walter Ulbricht's statement that ""No one has any intention of building a wall"", along with readings from literature that is banned in the GDR. During the 1950s, 70 to 80 percent of listeners are in the GDR. The East German regime views it all as provocation. It sets up a plethora of jamming stations in an attempt to block the station's transmissions - but fails miserably.  

You've got mail  

Broadcasts such as Berlin Speaks to the Zone and Meeting Place are particularly popular. Thousands of people write in to the station, though many letters never get there because they are confiscated by the Stasi. RIAS employs a number of ruses to get around the problem, such as setting up alias addresses. Listeners also protect their identities with aliases so that they don't get caught sending in requests and dedications. Draconian punishments are meted out to people who are caught listening to Western radio stations. But even this fails to dampen East Germans' enthusiasm for RIAS and AFN, the American Forces Network. The AFN is actually aimed at the military, but English-language music is popular on both sides of the Wall. Even after the Wall comes down, RIAS and AFN retain many loyal listeners until they eventually stop broadcasting in 1993 and 1994.

",,,"A Cologne architect builds Berlin
At the age of 39, he's an overnight sensation. Franz Heinrich Schwechten hopes his design for the new Anhalter railway station will propel him into the premier league of German architects - and into the consciousness of the imperial family.

The project description that the railway company issues to its new chief architect states he is to take on ""the artistic supervision of the construction work, the elaboration of all construction plans and detailed drawings, and the design of all the artistic decoration for the building"". Anhalter station originally opened in 1841 and was gradually expanded to cope with the growth in rail traffic. Now, at the dawn of the German Empire, it is to be completely rebuilt. Schwechten, a native of Cologne, is the government's new chief architect. He leaps at the opportunity to add a major new building project to his architectural portfolio. The long-distance train station near Potsdamer Platz in Berlin has to be appropriately grand for an up-and-coming city like Berlin.  

A monument for a metropolis 

When you stand in front of what little is left of Anhalter station, it's hard to imagine the sheer scale of this magnificent building. It was badly damaged during the war and the Senate ordered its demolition in 1959. All that remains it its imposing entrance. Can you see the football pitch behind it? The two rows of oak trees either side of the pitch mark where the station concourse used to run. It stretched as far as the Tempodrom. Schwechten has the entire concourse covered with a gigantic single-span, arched steel and glass roof. The roof spans 63 metres, the biggest in Europe and a masterpiece of engineering. ""The roof spans an area of 10,200 m without any supports, and 40,000 people can stand under it at the same time"". This is the admiring description published in the architectural journal Wochenblatt für Architekten und Ingenieure.   

Schwechten also has something special in mind for the front of the building. He chooses a distinctive hard-fired yellow brick known as Greppiner Klinker for the simple yet elegant façade of this new ""Gateway to the South"", which will connect Berlin with Rome, Athens and Constantinople. Chancellor Otto von Bismarck joins Kaiser Wilhelm I at the opening ceremony on 15 June 1880. Decades later, Schwechten is asked to design the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in honour of Wilhelm I. He is also the architect behind many of the churches, villas, administrative buildings and industrial complexes that shape Berlin in the Wilhelmine era. Most of them are destroyed during the Second World War.

",,,"Urban farming – growing for the future
The smell of the old malt factory has long since disappeared. Now a new wind of change is blowing through this former industrial complex. Berlin's first city farm is home to a multitude of fascinating tenants, including thousands of fish (cichlids) and its popular basil that is ""grown in the city"".

Fish and veg? Sounds weird, but it's part of a revolution in food production. And it's happening right here in the heart of the city - at Ecofriendly Farmsystems (ECF). This aquaponics farm is run by Nicolas Leschke and Christian Echternacht with a focus on environmentally friendly, sustainable food production. 

The magic words? Resource efficiency 

The company's two founders rolled up their sleeves and converted part of the complex into an urban farm. At its heart are the fish tanks that accommodate around 40,000 fish per year. Rainwater is filtered into the tanks, the fish food is organic, and giving the fish antibiotics is a no-no for Leschke and team.   The result is the farm's own delicious perch. The city-farmed fish not only taste good but are a key component in the ECF food chain. Their liquid excretions are converted into nitrates by the action of bacteria. These nitrates are then used to fertilise the vegetables and herbs that are grown in the nearby greenhouses.

Tomatoes, aubergines, cucumbers, peppers, herbs, lemon grass, salads, chard and more grow on substrates such as rock wool and expanded clay. The farm's bestsellers are its own brand of basil and tomatoes. The vegetables and herbs are watered using the filtered, nitrate-rich water from the fish tanks. The plants' roots are immersed in the nutrient-rich solution - and grow like weeds! Leschke estimates a single plant can produce 50 kilos of tomatoes.  

Taking Berlin's aquaponics to the world 

The term aquaponics comes from aquaculture, meaning fish farming, and hydroponics, which means growing plants in water. Along with their own farm, the two founders also design and build aquaponics systems for customers all over the world. The Berlin farm is both a flagship project and an expanding test site. It's city-grown perch and basil are available in selected supermarkets - or pick some up on a tour of the farm.

Years before the advent of aquaponics, a maltster discovered that these huge kettles were just as good for fish farming as for brewing beer.

",,,"Gangsters in frock coats
29 December 1928 - a Saturday evening in Berlin. Around 11 pm, eight men in formal suits, top hats and patent leather shoes go into the corner pub Armelien. At the bar, they order a round of beer. Hardly have they finished their drinks before they start beating up two carpenters. What looks like a spontaneous pub fight is a deliberate attack. Over the course of the night, it develops into Berlin's biggest ever free-for-all. The opposing sides comprise 50 carpenters from Hamburg and 150 members of Berlin's criminal underworld - the so-called Ringvereine that control the city's night life.

Escalation after midnight 

The carpenters, all members of the same artisan guild, have long been a thorn in the side of the city's underworld. In those days, Berlin crime syndicates often set up legal ex-convict wrestling associations called Ringvereine (literally: 'ring associations') to front their activities, including protection money. But now just the strong physical presence of the carpenters in some bars spoils business for the Immertreu (Always Loyal) association and its boss Adolf Leib, nicknamed Muscle Adolf. Some pub landlords become mutinous, no longer willing to pay protection money to Leib. In a pub brawl the day before, one of the carpenters badly injured a member of the Norden (North) association - giving Muscle Adolf a reason to teach the Hamburg carpenters a lesson. 

By chance, Muscle Adolf and his men in their elegant tuxedos are just on the way back from the funeral of one of their gang when they receive a tip-off. The obstreperous carpenter from the day before has been seen in the Armelien pub in Breslauer Straße - the carpenters' regular. The idea is to take the man away, but his fellow carpenters defend him tooth and claw, driving off Muscle Adolf and his cronies. When everything is over, the police are alerted, come by and take a look at the scene.  

Just one hour and one telephone call later, around 15 cars packed with members of the Immertreu and Norden associations are heading for the area looking for trouble. What follows is a free-for-all, Berlin's largest ever street brawl. In the end, Muscle Adolf's gang draw their guns. The carpenter Paul Mörlitz is killed by a bullet in the head. The pub is wrecked during the fight, as is Leos Hof, the Ringverein meeting point opposite. 

Acquittal in Moabit 

The police arrest Muscle Adolf. At the Moabit Criminal Court, he is given ten months on probation - more or less an acquittal. The witnesses, bribed and intimidated, staunchly refuse to testify. But Muscle Adolf's spell of freedom does not last - in 1934, the Nazi regime arrest him as a ""professional criminal"". He is interned in a concentration camp, where he is thought to have been murdered. 

Chicago-style conditions? 

During the trial, the media spotlight is on the Ringvereine. Berlin's Chief of Police Karl Friedrich Zörgiebel plays down the incident, only talking of a major brawl, nothing comparable to the armed street fights in Chicago.Zörgiebel sees a far greater threat in the two paramilitary organisations of the Nazi's SA and the Communist's RFB. Although the Immertreu association is banned before the trial, the ban has to be lifted afterwards. The police continue to make only half-hearted efforts to pursue the Ringvereine, Berlin's world of organised crime. Perhaps they saw the premiere of Bertolt Brecht's Threepenny Opera in August in the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm? In it, Mac the Knife recommends: ""Injustice should be spared from persecution. Soon it will freeze to death, for it is cold.""
",,"During the first brawl in the evening, a carpenter is said to have beaten Muscle Adolf around the head so ferociously that the gangster's top hat slipped over his ears - an unparalleled humiliation.

But state prosecutor Dr. Erich Frey is also humiliated. During the trial, his fur coat is stolen. At Christmas, he receives a surprise parcel - with sincere best wishes and a note from the Immertreu association: ""Honestly lost, honestly acquired"".

",,,"Sex, sharing and subversion
Germany's first communes are an attempt to break down the antiquated, conservative structures of post-war society through left-wing ideas and the creative power of political protest. They fail to last - but succeed in changing the country. 

Students go to university in suits and ties, unmarried people aren't allowed to live together, women need their husband's permission to go out to work. These days it's hard to imagine the prudish, conformist mentality that still dominates West Germany in the late 1960s.   

Antifascism and the removal of toilet doors  

It's February 1967 and a group of nine left-wing students led by Fritz Teufel and Dieter Kunzelmann have had enough of a narrow-minded society that suppresses individual freedoms and turns a blind eye to Nazi crimes. Together they set up Commune 1 in West Berlin. It is not only Germany's very first commune, but also a radical alternative to the country's conservative norms. Private property no longer exists, toilet doors are removed to do away with personal refuges, everyone supposedly loves everyone else.  

The students view the German nuclear family as a breeding ground for fascism. They want their commune to give men and women the freedom to be themselves, and provide a nonconformist alternative.   

For two years, these creative provocateurs and political activists make international headlines. They plan a ""pudding assassination"" of US Vice President Humphrey and are described by the Springer press as ""horror communards"". The commune moves into an apartment in Niedstraße, and then later to Charlottenburg and Moabit. Members come and go. 

Rebels are treated like pop stars     

When the model Uschi Obermaier joins the group, nude pictures start doing the rounds and celebrities like Jimi Hendrix start dropping by. The revolutionary project mutates into something of a media phenomenon and the communards are treated like the pop stars of the extra-parliamentary opposition. They start charging for photo shoots and interviews and founding members are thrown out for drug addiction and having affairs. It seems some freedoms are now beyond the pale, even for Germany's most famous rebels. Commune members are drawn into heated arguments about their political direction, there is growing hostility from outside the group and conflict becomes the order of the day. Then the commune is attacked by rockers, and it breaks up in 1969.  

Looking back, the commune's wild and decadent lifestyle seems to have been staged to some extent. ""Free love - that was just propaganda. None of that really happened"", recalls communard Dagmar von Doetinchem. But there's no doubt that Commune 1 exposed the authoritarian state to ridicule and sent out a liberating political message to the whole of Germany. It flew the flag for equality and inspired the house-sharing culture that swept the country in the 1980s. 

The ""political commune"" is even more short-lived   

The ""political commune"" known today as Commune II and set up in August 1967, breaks up after just one year. The group, which is pioneered by Rudi and Gretchen Dutschke, also includes the filmmaker and subsequent Red Army Faction member Jan-Carl Raspe, but it fails in its attempt to combine communal living with joint political action.  

Self-run housing collectives for teenagers and young adults still exist in Berlin today, such as the Tommy Weisbecker House in Berlin-Kreuzberg. Founded in 1973, it is named after a Red Army Faction member who was killed by the police.

",,,"Prussia’s Scotland Yard
Instead of a huge pink shopping centre, Berliners walking down Dircksenstraße in the 1920s are faced with another massive building - Berlin's police headquarters, known as the Red Castle because of its red brick façade.

This building houses all the departments of the Prussian police force. It is where the famous criminologist Ernst Gennat reorganises how homicides are investigated. And it is from here that a brave deputy chief fights a determined campaign against enemies of the Republic. 

The stronghold of justice 

One question is preoccupying the people of Berlin: why is crime particularly prevalent in the area around the police HQ? Alexanderplatz is within sight of the building's massive corner tower, and behind that is the Scheunenviertel, a district that is known for its high levels of petty crime.

The Berlin police have a thankless task. Along with hunting down criminals, they have to contain the political violence that flares up regularly around the city. This is becoming increasingly difficult, partly because of Joseph Goebbels, who arrives in Berlin by train on 7 November 1926. As Berlin's new Gauleiter, or regional party leader, his job is to win over Red Berlin for the National Socialists - by force if necessary. 

This also involves a battle with the Red Castle. His path is blocked by the uncompromising Social Democrat Bernhard Weiß, who is appointed deputy chief of police shortly after Goebbel's arrival. On 5 May 1927, Weiß has the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP) banned in Berlin following numerous violent clashes between the SA and local communists. As a result, Goebbels sets about defaming the Jewish deputy police chief in an unprecedented anti-Semitic smear campaign. In his newly founded newspaper Der Angriff, or The Attack, he repeatedly refers to Weiß as ""Isidor"" - an insulting anti-Semitic name. 

The last bulwark of the Republic 

Bernhard Weiß fights the Nazis in his professional capacity and also defends himself as a private citizen. He successfully brings a number of defamation charges against Goebbels. Case files start to pile up on Goebbels' desk. The Gauleiter is on the verge of a nervous breakdown and notes in his diary that it makes him ""puke"".  It is only his immunity as a member of the Reichstag since 1928 that affords him any protection. 

On 12 May 1932, Nazi members of parliament beat up an SPD member in the Reichstag restaurant. Weiß himself leads the subsequent police operation inside the parliament building. As soon as they spot him, the Nazis chant ""Isidor"". Weiß criticises his superiors for not doing enough to defend democracy. In 1932 he believes Prussia is the last bulwark of the republic, and still defends it with a sense of optimism. But the bulwark crumbles. 

The government of the Reich overthrows the Prussian government in what becomes known as the Prussian coup. As a result, Weiß loses his job on 20 July 1932 and is forced to flee Berlin on 5 March 1933 when SA troops storm his apartment on Steinplatz. He escapes just in time and goes into exile with his wife - initially in Prague, and then in London. And the Red Castle, the proud headquarters of the Berlin police, is turned into a Nazi torture chamber.

The Great Refractor, the longest moveable telescope in the world, protrudes from the observatory like an oversized drinking straw. It draws visitors to an industrial exhibition that wants to be so much more. Astronomer Friedrich Archenhold is also reaching for the stars.

Kaiser Wilhelm II and his Chancellor know very little about astrology.  Rather than at the heavens, their gaze tends to be directed towards their eternal rivals, Paris and London. Unlike these two cities, Berlin has never hosted a world fair. 

Academics, artistic directors and architects all believe it's high time for Berlin to host an international exhibition. But their rulers remain unconvinced of the benefits. Paris might be rapidly turning into a den of iniquity, but Berlin has other things to offer.  

Creative compromise 

In the end, it's the Association of Berlin Merchants and Industrialists (VBKI) that sets the project in motion. If not a world fair, then how about an industrial exhibition? The Emperor agrees - an exhibition of the latest technology is very much his cup of tea. It would also serve as a useful distraction from the looming economic crisis. But this kind of thing takes money, as astronomer Archenhold knows all too well. His new telescope will have a focal length of 21 metres, making it unique and very expensive. Fortunately, he has attracted enough donations to give his design work free rein.  

The exhibition comes and goes but the sky cannon remains 

While Archenhold plans and builds, the elite of German industry are setting up shop in 300 exhibition buildings. The Observatory is finally ready after many months of delays. But it's worth the wait. The giant telescope, nicknamed the sky cannon, attracts hordes of visitors who want to get closer to the stars. Faced with so much enthusiasm, the Kaiser finds it hard to say no. He allows the small planetarium to be the only building to remain standing once the exhibition closes.  

The world's most famous stargazer, Albert Einstein, visits the planetarium on 15 July 1915 and gives his first lecture on relativity. Archenhold and Einstein have a close, collegial relationship based on a shared passion for science and their Jewish roots. They will both suffer anti-Semitic attacks in the years to come.  

While Einstein emigrates to the USA, the Archenhold family with their five children opt to stay in Berlin. It proves to be a fatal decision. Friedrich Archenhold dies in 1939 in the knowledge that his son Günther had to flee to England after the Nazis refused to let him take over as director of the observatory. His wife Alice is murdered in Theresienstadt concentration camp on 9 February 1943. His daughter Hilde also dies there. His other three children, Horst, Lilly and Ilse, manage to escape the Nazis.

",,,"Assassination in Charlottenburg
The crime takes place on Hardenbergstraße on Tuesday 15 March 1921. Around 11am, Ali Sali Bey leaves his apartment and strolls towards the zoo. He walks past house number 17, close to the Fasanenstraße intersection where one of the Technical University buildings stands today. A young man approaches and pulls a Luger pistol from his pocket. He aims at the back of the Turkish businessman's head and pulls the trigger. Sali Bey is dead before he hits the pavement. Passers-by apprehend the fleeing assassin and beat him to the ground.

Three months later, Solomon Tehlirian is up before the Berlin Regional Court accused of murder. The Armenian has confessed to his crime but shows no signs of remorse. After a trial lasting just two days, he is acquitted. The courtroom erupts into cheers. What's going on? 

The victim is a murderer 

The Turkish businessman whose life ends so suddenly on that Charlottenburg pavement is actually Talaat Pasha, the former Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire, a Muslim fundamentalist and Turkish nationalist. As the leader of the Young Turks movement, Talaat Pasha was one of the main perpetrators of the Armenian Genocide during the First World War. Under his instructions, soldiers began systematically exterminating the Christian minority, leading to the deportation and murder of 1.5 million Armenians. After the war the Young Turks were forced to step down and those responsible for the Genocide were sentenced to death in absentia. Talaat Pasha fled to Germany, a former ally, and lived incognito in Berlin. 

The murderer is a victim 

His landlady describes the accused as a serious, melancholy man who likes to play sad songs on the mandolin and always seems terribly nervous. Tehlirian, born in 1897 in Pakaritch, Turkey, paints himself as a victim. He talks of massacres in his hometown and the murder of his parents in June 1915. He describes how his sister was kidnapped and raped, and how he had to watch as his younger brother was killed with an axe. How he lay under the body for two days and then fled to safety in the mountains. He explains how, after several years of living a nomadic life, he came to Berlin in late 1920 to escape these terrible memories. But the images in his head continue to haunt him and his dead mother appears to him at night, demanding revenge. He claims he bumped into Talaat Pasha by chance and moved into the apartment across the street, where thoughts of revenge drove him to take action. 

A tragic avenging angel 

The defence succeeds in justifying Tehlirian's actions on moral grounds. Expert witnesses give credence to his account and support his claim of diminished responsibility. They claim his epilepsy can be traced back to the mental disturbances caused by his traumatic experiences. The authorities are also pressuring the court to close the case as quietly as possible. What appears to be an isolated act must not be politicised. The fanatical murderer becomes a tragic avenger, and it takes the jury just one hour to declare his innocence. Tehlirian leaves Germany a free man.
",,"Only much later does it come to light that Solomon Tehlirian is not his real name. His tale of woe is a total fabrication and his revenge has been meticulously planned. The melancholy epileptic is actually a member of Nemesis, an Armenian hit squad responsible for assassinating numerous Young Turk politicians.

",,,"Revolution in rotation
1931 - a sleepy summer afternoon in Berlin. The Volksbühne theatre dozes at the heart of Bülowplatz. On the right is the Babylon cinema.  But suddenly all hell breaks loose.

Hundreds of police descend, blocking off the street and storming the building on the corner of Kleine Alexanderstraße and Weydinger Straße. It's yet another police raid on Karl-Liebknecht-Haus - the headquarters of the KPD, the Communist Party of Germany.  

Crackdown on the Commies 

The security police set about searching the building where the KPD's newspaper, Die Rote Fahne (The Red Flag) is produced. Some of them head to the basement, where the massive printing press is churning out copies of the latest issue. Two openings have been made in the first floor to accommodate this huge machine. The police confiscate the materials being printed. The editorial offices of the Red Flag are on the second floor. The police once again search every nook and cranny for suspect materials. Arthur Gohlke, a member of the Reichstag, barricades himself in his office, but his struggle is futile and he is eventually arrested.  

The raid is the result of suspicions that the KPD is trying to undermine the armed forces. A few weeks earlier, leaflets had appeared encouraging soldiers in the German army to mutiny. The KPD acquired the building on Bülowplatz on 30 July 1926, after it outgrew its old party headquarters on Rosenthaler Strasse. Since then, police raids have become commonplace.  

From eagle to red star 

The Communists buy the factory building for nearly half a million Reichsmark from Vulkan GmbH, a company that sympathises with the KPD. They name it after their murdered former leader, Karl Liebknecht. At the time, the building is known as the Adlerhaus (the eagle building) because of the stone eagle perched on a globe on the gable facing Bartelstraße. The architect Alfred Wilke redesigns the interior to suit the needs of its new owners. The Lenin Hall on the fourth floor can hold 150 people, and this is where the party's central committee will meet from now on. The office of party leader Ernst Thälmann is just around the corner, overlooking Bülowplatz. Thälmann occasionally walks over to the newspaper's office and tells the staff what stories to run. For example, he might ask for more reports about ""broken toilet seats"", because workers in factories also have their day-to-day problems.  

Trouble on Bülowplatz 

After the KPD move in, Bülowplatz becomes a regular flashpoint. On 9 August 1931, communists murder two policemen outside the Babylon cinema. For their part, the Nazis enjoy provoking the Communists right outside their party headquarters. So the funeral procession for the murdered SA leader Horst Wessel is sent across Bülowplatz. When the National Socialists take power, they rename the building Horst-Wessel-Haus. From March 1933 onwards it houses the Sturmabteilung (SA).
",,"The building's exterior gives a clear indication of its mission. The slogans and banners that adorn its façade change regularly. Sometimes it's a poster of Lenin that looks out across Bülowplatz. A flower bed in the form of a Soviet star is also planted in front of the building.

",,,"Road safety gets the green light
An act of sabotage? No, it's all about improving road safety. On the evening of 20 October 1924 a team of men arrive in Potsdamer Platz. They cut the overhead tram lines and start digging up the track. The next morning, a five-sided steel structure rises above the square's central island. Berlin has its very first traffic lights - and a new attraction for sightseers.

The new technology has been introduced to combat the traffic chaos that reigns on Potsdamer Platz. Electric trams have crossed the square since the turn of the century. But now they have been joined by a lot more cars. People take their lives in their hands trying to get across the intersection. Travel guides warn children and the elderly about the dangers of Europe's busiest square.  

Inspiration from America 

In the summer of 1924, the Berlin tram company turns to America for ideas. A delegation is sent to New York, where they marvel at the new traffic lights on Fifth Avenue. The Berliners shell out 10,000 Reichsmarks to buy the plans for the American traffic light tower and return home. The architect Jean Krämer is commissioned to build a similar tower in the middle of Potsdamer Platz. The firm of Siemens & Halske installs the system, with the traffic lights displayed horizontally.  

The Berliners have to get used to the significance of the colours: red means stop, green means go and white means that pedestrians can cross the square. A policeman is clearly visible inside the turret. He is there to control the system - and ensure people obey the lights.  

From source of irritation to popular photo subject 

At first the traffic lights have plenty of critics. Kurt Tucholsky thinks they are ridiculous and taxi passengers want them removed because taxi drivers keep their meters running when the lights are at red. But the Berliners gradually accept the traffic lights and they become a favourite with photographers. Tourists and locals make the pilgrimage to Potsdamer Platz. In 1929, in his popular guide for walks around the city, Franz Hessel describes the intersection as follows: ""In the middle stands the famous traffic light tower, watching over the game in the streets like an umpire's chair at a tennis match"". 

After a few years the traffic light tower becomes obsolete. In 1937 it is demolished to make way for the construction of the north-south suburban railway line. But the memory of the traffic light system survives the test of time. When Potsdamer Platz is redesigned in 1997, a replica of the tower is erected a few metres from its original location, and once again it is Siemens that installs the lights. Today it no longer controls the traffic but acts as an iconic reminder of the 1920s.
",,"A traffic census carried out on Potsdamer Platz on 28 July 1928 reveals that 33,037 vehicles crossed the intersection between 8am and 8pm. 57% were cars, 26% bicycles, 10% trams, 3% motorcycles, 3% horse-drawn vehicles and 1% handcarts.

",,,"From airfield to public park
Today's Tempelhofer Feld park was once an aviation hub. In 1909, American aviation pioneer Orville Wright flew over these grassy meadows. Later, this was also where the public marvelled at the new Zeppelin airships. Here, between 1936 and 1939, architect Ernst Sagebeil set out to construct the largest airport in Europe at that time - an elegantly curved airport building, over 1.2km long with over 9000 rooms.

After the seizure of power in 1933, Hitler and the Nazi party plan to radically rebuilt Berlin as the global capital of the Third Reich. The monumental Tempelhof Airport building belongs to the few plans ever realised. Although never finally completed, it illustrates the ambivalence in Nazi architecture between grand plans and modern construction methods. The main reception hall has an impressive pubic façade with 21 entrance doors, elaborately designed windows, reliefs and sculptures including a massive aluminium eagle. The eagle's head is now set in front of the building.

A modernist building

Yet behind this façade with shell limestone slabs and window surrounds of Jura limestone, the airport is a modernist building. In the Weimar Republic, Ernst Sagebeil works for architect Erich Mendelsohn. While Mendelsohn, due to his Jewish heritage, has to flee the Nazis in 1933, Sagebeil is quick to launch his career under the new conditions. His design for the airport is strictly functional, with a systematic division of space into areas for passengers, luggage, freight and post. From the check-in areas, passengers quickly reach the departure gates. Sagebeil's unsupported curved steel roof extending 40 metres out over the airfield is one of the airport's most distinctive features - and a major technical achievement.

In the late 1930s, as the preparations for war intensify, construction work on the airport is suspended. Hitler's ""world airport"" is never completely finished. Air traffic still uses the old Berlin airport from the 1920s. In the new airport building, forced labourers make armaments for Hitler's war machine.

The Allies attack Tempelhof Airport several times. At the end of the war, the Soviet Red Army occupies the site. Soon afterwards, when the Allies agree on the occupation zones in Germany and Berlin, Tempelhof Airport is in the American Sector. 

An airlift around the clock

In the wake of the Second World War, the antagonisms between the superpowers fuel the Cold War. When the Western Powers plan to introduce the Deutschmark in the western sectors of Berlin even without Soviet agreement, Stalin orders the city to be sealed off. Suddenly, on 24 June 1948 two million residents and the Allied occupying forces are left without sufficient supplies.

But the Western Powers refuse to abandon West Berlin. Just two days later on 26 June 1948, the first plane with relief supplies lands at Tempelhof Airport. For eleven months, the Western Powers supply West Berlin through an elaborate airlift. The blockade finally ends on 12 May 1949. 

West Berlin's ""gateway to the world""

Tempelhof Airport only really comes into its own as an airport in a divided Berlin. In 1951, the Americans open the airport to civilian air traffic. For some years, Tempelhof is Germany's largest airport. The war damage is repaired and new annexes constructed. In 1962, Tempelhof Airport is finished.

The Basic Treaty between West and East Germany in 1972 provides for a road corridor and rail lines connecting Berlin with the West. In air transport, the new generation jet aircraft become the norm - but the Tempelhof Airport runways are too short for them. West Berlin looks to the new airport in Tegel as the future.

Tempelhof Airport is finally closed in 2008.

Today, the airport buildings have become a popular event location. In 2014, in the face of plans to build on the vast airfield, the Berliners push through a referendum on its future use - and vote overwhelmingly for preserving it as today's Tempelhofer Feld Park, a vast open space in the inner city.

There, in the 1960s celebrities, film stars and top athletes all pose on the steps to planes, while film directors use the airport as a backdrop for their movies, just as Billy Wilder does in his classic comedy One, Two, Three.

",,,"A dance hall for the young at heart
""Widow's ball at Clärchen's"": ""the young at heart"" gather to dance  in the building behind Auguststraße 24. In the Hall of Mirrors on the first floor or the Ballroom on the ground floor, couples polka, waltz, foxtrot, shimmy and Charleston to the strains of live bands. Officially, the dance hall is still called Bühler's Ballroom, but it is Clara Bühler who runs the show and organises the widow's balls several times a week. By the 1930s, the venue has become known as Clärchen's Ballroom.

Widow's balls are not just for widows. They are all about ""femininity acknowledging its independence"" as writer Curt Moreck puts it.  But these are not orgies. Quite the opposite, everything is rather respectable and bourgeois. But it is also clear that the ladies who attend are not being strictly controlled by their husbands. They get to choose who they want to dance with. 

Fun for working people 

Clärchen's Ballroom is fascinating today because it seems such an anachronism. But in the 1920s there were plenty of dance halls like this one. Located in densely populated inner-city districts, they offered working people a place to relax and have fun. Dancing provided a great opportunity to make new friends, but everything had to remain above board, as dance halls could easily gain a bad reputation. People who go dancing at Clärchen's Ballroom don't have to be young, slim or dressed in the latest fashions. The clientele is a mix of workers and lower middle class, the kind of people who at the time were called the ""Zille milieu"" after the popular drawings of the ""common people"" created by illustrator Heinrich Zille.  

""New woman"" and the ballroom sisters 

Clärchen remarries in 1929, two years after the death of her first husband Fritz Bühler. She's still the boss of the ballroom, organising the day-to-day business and running the restaurant with an iron fist. Employees describe her as ambitious, determined and assertive - the qualities needed by businesswomen in a man's world. The 1920s sees the first cracks starting to appear in this world as women gain the right to vote and new horizons open up thanks to better employment and educational opportunities. Other changes are also afoot. New fashions such as the bob haircut and dresses that can be worn without a corset create new images of women that are disseminated in the media, arts and culture. 

Clara Bühler also cuts her hair, and she decides to create some female solidarity. She regularly meets up with other women who run ballrooms and dance halls - and they become known as the ""ballroom sisters"". These meetings are useful for sharing ideas and providing mutual support. They also provide the women with a welcome breather in their busy lives, which are otherwise devoted to providing their guests with a good time. 
","Opening hours:
Clärchen's Ballroom still offers all kinds of dancing. Wednesdays is Swing, then there's ballroom dancing on Thursdays, informal dancing on Fridays and Saturdays, and a tea dance on Sunday afternoons.","Clärchen's Ballroom is still the place to be, as demonstrated in summer 2017 when Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate spent an hour visiting the historic dance hall to learn more about Berlin's creative scene.

",,,"Out of the closet and onto the streets!
Melitta Poppe, Chou Chou de Briquette, Pepsi Boston and Melitta Sundström - the icons of Berlin's gay scene were at home in SchwuZ. Short for SchwulenZentrum (gay centre) the club was once a hotbed of the gay rights movement. 

A huge, empty hall. A tiny, scruffy bar and a couple of old mattresses. The smell of stale cigarette smoke hangs in the air. The atmosphere is rancid at Kulmer Straße, where SchwuZ was founded in 1977 by the Homosexual Action West Berlin (HAW). It's one of the few places that gay men can meet in a relaxed atmosphere, at a time when society still views homosexuality as ""verboten"", ""unnatural"" and ""perverse"".  

Driving gay culture underground  

SchwuZ is extremely political. Paragraph 175 entered Germany's Criminal Code during the 1870s, making homosexual acts between men a crime. They were partially decriminalised in 1969, meaning that homosexual acts would go unpunished under certain conditions. But paragraph 175 was still driving gay culture underground - into the 'cottages', the public toilets where gay men meet for anonymous sex.  

That's why, in 1971, Rosa von Praunheim makes the rousing cry ""Out of the cottages and onto the streets"" in his film It is not the homosexual who is perverse, but the society in which he lives. He calls on gays to come out of the closet and fight actively for equality and tolerance for their way of life.  

The documentary film becomes a vital spark for the lesbian and gay movement. The film's director also provides SchwuZ with its first premises in Dannewitzstraße. It was there, and in Kulmer Straße where you are now standing, that gay culture began to take root. 

Queers and their gear  

The fight for gay rights has its fun side, and SchwuZ hosts some legendary parties. The men's discos held on Saturdays soon become a cult and, decades later, people still remember the amazing drag shows. The drag queens' outfits are a revolt against gender stereotypes, and their shrill performances are consciously and entertainingly crossing a boundary. SchwuZ provides a space for activism. Gay schoolboys gather here and set up their own group. It is the home of the pink telephone initiative, which later becomes a gay counselling service. It's the birthplace of Die Siegessäule, Berlin's gay - now queer - magazine. And SchwuZ activists organised Germany's very first Christopher Street Day back in 1979.  

Three parades and 40 years later, SchwuZ is still a major player in Berlin's cultural and party scene. It's hard to imagine the city without it. It has changed perceptions of how we live and love, to the point where Berlin's former mayor Klaus Wowereit proclaimed during his campaign: ""I'm gay - and that's a good thing!"" Society has moved on and nowadays some of the clubbers at SchwuZ are not even aware the part it played in the struggle for gay rights.
",,"In 1852, Berlin physician Johann Ludwig Casper published an essay in which, for the first time, he aired the argument that homosexuality is an innate characteristic. In 1869 Rudolf Virchow also called for homosexual acts to be legalised. This was finally achieved when paragraph 175 was annulled on 11 June 1994.

",,,"The subterranean frontier
""Last stop in Berlin West"". When they hear the tannoy announcement, the commuter train passengers know what it means. The division of Berlin means that the DDR regime has created a border right down the middle of the public transport network. Three subway and commuter rail lines no longer stop at East Berlin's seemingly abandoned stations. 

The West Berliners call them ""ghost stations"" because the division of Berlin means their platforms stand empty. Now and then it's possible to spot a sentry keeping a watchful eye over the gloom. 

After Berlin's division into sectors, the SED was forced to watch how - of all things - it was the S-Bahn, the commuter rail network owned by East Germany's Deutsche Reichsbahn, that became a popular means of escape. It became a ""gateway to the democratic sector"". It was not only a gateway for the many cross-border commuters who failed to return to the Eastern sector, but also for illicit goods.  

Closing the gap in the system  

On 13 August 1961, the regime takes action. Today's U-Bahn lines 6 and 8 and the S-Bahn's north-south line (today's S1, S2 and S25) were no longer allowed to stop at the 16 stations in East Berlin. Passengers who got on in the West could only alight in the West. 

East Berlin train lines that are manned by West Berliners but not allowed to stop in the East? The absurdity of such a system sparks an outcry, spearheaded by Berlin's mayor Willy Brandt, who fumes: ""It is unacceptable that Western proceeds from the S-Bahn are being used to buy barbed wire."" 

And indeed, the border police are equipping the platforms with fences, barbed wire obstacles, walls, beds of nails and guards galore. 

Even the guards are escaping  

Ironically, up to 1966 it was the regime's own people who were taking advantage of this underground escape route. A quick visit to the toilet, a moment without surveillance - and border guards were regularly disappearing through the emergency exits and tunnels. The authorities respond by gradually installing rolling grilles in the tunnels, locking the emergency exits, and in the end they even wall in the sentries. Now only officers can unlock the doors, and the guards have to watch over the platform through small windows - through which they can shoot if necessary. Many civilians try to escape via this route, and at least ten lose their lives in the attempt.   

Today, the former Nordbahnhof ghost station is part of the Berlin Wall Memorial and houses an exhibition entitled ""Border Stations and Ghost Stations in Divided Berlin"". In addition to the exhibition, aluminium panels on the floor serve as reminders of the barriers that were used to block off the station entrances.
",Freely accessible during S-Bahn operating hours,"Every successful - or unsuccessful - escape attempt led to security being ramped up at the ghost stations. If the escape involved breaking through a wall, the Reichsbahn installed a second wall on the spot. The Invalidenstraße entrance to Nordbahnhof held the record, with six walls and a steel grille.

",,,"“The day of freedom has dawned”
Saturday, 9 November 1918. A wave of revolutions across Germany reaches Berlin. In the afternoon, the Lustgarten square fills with packed crowds. The guards at the gateways to the City Palace leave their posts. The police and officers move off. The revolutionaries take over the City Palace, the Prussian centre of power and century-long residence of the Hohenzollern rulers.

On the first floor over the impressive entrance known as Portal IV, a window opens. A red blanket is placed over the balustrade. This is the same window where, on 1 August 1914, Kaiser Wilhelm II announced the start of the war to his cheering subjects. But four years and 16 million dead later, the Kaiser has abdicated. Now, the figure at the window is the workers' leader, Karl Liebknecht, son of the founder of Germany's SPD socialist party and godson of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. For Karl Liebknecht, this is the climax of his political career, a moment making the deprivations, imprisonment, and persecution he suffered all worthwhile.                     He shouts out his message to the eager crowds below. The war is over, the day of freedom has come, never again will the Hohenzollern dynasty, the Prussian rulers, walk over this square. From the window, he proclaims the free socialist republic of Germany. The people cheer and wave flags, raising their hands to take an oath in support of the new republic.

A bloody civil war

Liebknecht's triumph is short-lived. The revolution ushers in a civil war, with months of bloody uprisings and street battles. On 15 January 1919, a paramilitary unit of World War I veterans arrest Karl Liebknecht, and summarily execute him together with Rosa Luxemburg. By then, the City Palace's Portal IV - where crowds gathered to celebrate the start and end of the First World War - is already badly damaged, shelled during a skirmish on 24 December 1918 between regular army units and the socialist revolutionary Volksmarinedivision entrenched in the palace.

Berlin City Palace demolished

Portal IV fades into obscurity until 1950, after the end of World War II. The regime in East Germany wants to tear down the shell of the burned-out City Palace, eradicating all traces of this relic of Prussian power. At the last minute, measures are taken to secure the balcony from which Karl Liebknecht reputedly declared Germany a socialist republic. The remains of the portal are put into storage. Finally, ten years later, construction brigades integrate the ""Liebknecht Portal"", as it is now known, into the façade of East Germany's State Council building.

Humboldt Forum

Today, you can find two Portal IVs. The remains of the original are set prominently in the front façade of the former GDR's State Council official building, now home to a private college. Facing Lustgarten square, a replica of the portal has been set up on the original site as part of the reconstructed façade of the Berlin City Palace - the new Humboldt Forum.

It's summer, and the Wall is being built. But 12-year-old Erwin from Eiskeller, an exclave of West Berlin, has other problems. He's feeling upset because his parents have split up and he's having a hard time at school.

So he comes up with a bright idea for getting out of Maths and Latin - he claims the East German police stopped him while he was cycling to school. The only way he can get to Spandau from Eiskeller is to ride 500 metres down a narrow corridor through East German territory. In the 1960s, 20 people live on 3 farms surrounded by barbed wire and the Wall. East German border guards watch over the fields and horses, the scent of freshly cut hay in their nostrils. After all, it would be relatively easy for East German citizens to escape to such a village. 

The threatening environment of the Cold War means that Erwin's story brings the Allies onto the scene. Instead of a couple of days off school, he ends up with an escort - and quite a special one! He is followed to school by a British armoured car manned by five soldiers. To school in the morning, back home in the afternoon - every single day.  

Cycling home through the GDR  

The division of Germany leads to the creation of several exclaves around Berlin. Villages in West Berlin suddenly find they are islands in GDR territory, and areas of East Germany are set adrift in West Berlin. This has an impact on people's daily lives, such as when West Berliners are harassed by East German border guards on their way home, even though they have the necessary permits. Steinstücken is one such exclave. Its 190 inhabitants include Heinrich Lummer, leader of the CDU faction in West Berlin's House of Representatives and later Senator of the Interior. They have no choice but to keep to themselves, as apart from doctors and the fire brigade, only registered inhabitants are allowed to enter Steinstücken. 

The Four Power Agreement of September 1971 ushers in a change to the status quo. It paves the way for an exchange of territory between the West Berlin Senate and the GDR government. There are advantages for both sides, as the West wants free access to its citizens and territories, while the East wants a clearly defined border that is easy to secure.  

A schoolyard hero 

The agreement on the settlement of enclaves through territorial exchange enters into force on 3 June 1972 under the Four Powers Agreement. The GDR receives 15.6 hectares of West Berlin, while the West Berliners gain 17.1 hectares of East Germany, including Steinstücken and improved access to Eiskeller.  

And Erwin? He's a schoolyard hero. A photo of Erwin on his bike followed by the soldiers in their armoured car flies around the world and he becomes a symbol of the Berliners' desire for freedom.

",,,"A prototype for socialist architecture
Thud, thud, thud. The sound of the masons' hammers echoes across the tract of land known as the Weberwiese. They reflect the mood of optimism that is sweeping through the German Democratic Republic. Brick by brick, the workers construct the tower that will welcome its first residents in just 6 months' time. The high-rise building on the Weberwiese is a prototype for the new socialist style of architecture.

The entrance to the 35-metre-high building is here at Marchlewskistraße 25. The building was designed jointly by a group of architects, including Hermann Henselmann, Hans Hipp and Richard Paulick. In the early days of the GDR, the regime was looking for a prototype that could be applied to the redevelopment of the area around Stalinallee, which was destroyed during the war and later re-named in honour of Karl Marx. This huge building project is meant to demonstrate the superiority of socialism in the class struggle with capitalism.  

The wedding-cake style dominates the east of the city 

The rulers reject the architects' initial designs as being too modern, sober and functional. At the next presentation, up-and-coming architect Hermann Henselmann stresses how the design has been heavily influenced by the neo-classicist master builder Karl Friedrich Schinkel, who shaped much of Prussian, imperial Berlin in the 19th century. This is enough to convince the Soviet authorities. They want buildings that reflect national and regional building traditions with typical design features. This leads to the development of an architectural style known as Socialist Classicism. This Stalinist wedding-cake style dominates the early years of the GDR. The construction work starts on 12 October 1951.  

Work goes on 24/7 

The East is determined to outdo the capitalist West by building faster, higher, more impressively. The magnificent socialist building is completed in record time. Work on the construction site on the Weberwiese building site never stops; the workers build, saw and hammer around the clock. At night, 20 floodlights illuminate the site. The authorities show little consideration for the workers, expecting them to carry on in wind, rain and freezing temperatures. Countless volunteers are also involved in the project. They are part of the Nationales Aufbauwerk (National Construction Project), called into life as part of efforts to rebuild East German cities destroyed during the war. The government is ruthless about increasing productivity and introduces measures such as longer standard working hours. As a result, the construction boom on Stalinallee, the great socialist boulevard, contributes to the workers' uprising of 17 June 1953 - a first cry for freedom.

But the building on the Weberwiese gets a warm reception. The first tenants move in on 1 May 1952, just six months after construction work began. The apartments are equipped to a high standard with fitted kitchens, telephones, central heating and even a lift - a luxury that the residents of future ""workers' palaces"" certainly won't get to enjoy. A verse by the playwright Bertolt Brecht is carved in stone in the entrance lobby. It sums up the mood of optimism surrounding this project on the Weberwiese: Friede in unserem Lande, Friede in unserer Stadt, dass sie den gut behause, der sie gebauet hat (Peace in our country, peace in our city, that they may house and protect those who built them""). 
",The Hochhaus is a residential building and not open to the public,"A lesson in upcycling - the high-rise block on the Weberwiese is mainly built from materials salvaged from the ruins of the war. The black marble in the entrance lobby comes from Hitler's Chancellery.

",,,"Boulevard of GDR architecture
Take a journey back in time to the 1950s. After the Second World War, the Große Frankfurter Straße lies in ruins. People desperately need housing - but here other issues are at stake as well. The Cold War leaves the city divided into East and West Berlin. East Germany's ruling SED, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, wants to prove that the GDR has more to offer workers - not simple flats, but comfortable palaces.

The newly constructed buildings really are luxurious. Instead of cold, cramped and unhygienic conditions in tenement flats, these apartments offer a very different life - up to 145 sq. metres of space, stuccoed ceilings, parquet floors, double windows, rubbish chutes, a bell system as well as central heating and a regular supply of warm water. The blocks also all have elevators.

East Germany's showpiece project

The boulevard between Berlin's Frankfurter Tor and Strausberger Platz is a major arterial road in East Berlin. It is renamed Stalinallee in 1949, and three years later becomes the site of East Berlin's first large-scale socialist prestige building project. This main thoroughfare is further widened to provide the grand setting needed for political rallies and military parades. The prototype apartment house is the 'Hochhaus an der Weberwiese' tower block finished in 1951-52 and designed by Hermann Henselmann, chief architect of the new Stalinallee.

Henselmann took his inspiration from the architecture popular under Stalin - Socialist Classicism and Socialist Realism. Although these styles are also influenced by neoclassicism, in particular by buildings by Prussia's renowned architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel, Stalinallee's main model comes from the residential blocks designed by Arkady Mordvinov in Moscow in the 1930s. Critics deride the monumental architecture of these Socialist Classicist tower blocks as a ""wedding cake style"".

The Stalinallee project begins on 3 February 1952. Thousands of workers construct the brick-built tower blocks. Newspapers and posters in East Germany never cease to sing the praises of the buildings along Stalinallee and many people hope to move into one of these coveted flats. The GDR film Die neue Wohnung (The New Apartment) featured the catchy Aufbau-Walzer (Reconstruction Waltz), also given generous airtime on radio: ""As high as the sky, as bright as the sun / building beautiful houses, now the cranes spin round / We shout: Heave ho! Heave ho! / We put our backs into it, the houses shoot up / Heave ho! Heave ho! For our new Berlin!""

But the propaganda only papers over the dissatisfaction with the economic and political situation in East Germany. In 1952 alone, 182,000 people leave the country. Initially, little changes even after Stalin's death on 5 March 1953. In May 1953, to accelerate the reconstruction of East Germany, the SED Politburo increases work quotas by ten percent - a decision many ordinary people see as the last straw. Across East Germany, crowds gathered to protest, not just calling for economic improvements, but also for free elections and the end of the Soviet-style SED regime.

The protests escalate on 17 June 1953. The SED regime seems helpless as demonstrators take to the streets. After a few hours, Soviet tanks and troops put a violent end to the popular uprising.

A prestige project in decline

Henselmann continues to oversee construction on Stalinallee until 1958. Then the gathering wave of de-Stalinization also sweeps over the architectural sphere as well. Stalin's monumental statue is removed and in 1961 the grand boulevard is renamed Karl-Marx-Allee. Stalinist monumental architecture is now outmoded. The apartments still remain much sought-after, though soon the buildings begin to look dilapidated.

",,,"The embassy that isn’t
A sea of hands waving through the slats of the window blind - these are the first pictures of the 55 GDR citizens who fled to West Germany's Permanent Mission (StäV) in East Berlin in June 1984. They are trying to leave East Germany via the de facto embassy that has been providing an unofficial escape hatch since 1974.

It all begins in May 1974 with a thawing of relations between West and East Germany and the signing of the Basic Treaty, which allows for the establishment of permanent missions. These representative offices are like embassies, but this is a term that West Germany is keen to avoid at all costs. It is prepared to recognise the GDR as a sovereign state, but not as a foreign country. In contrast to the two-state theory of the GDR, Germany's political aim is clear: reunification.  

West Germany's Permanent Mission opens in Berlin-Mitte in 1974. It is headed up by SPD politician Günter Gaus. The mission's permanent representatives in East Berlin handle negotiations on transport routes, travel and cultural projects. But alongside their daily work they regularly face a more difficult task: helping East Germans to escape. This West German oasis in the heart of East Berlin represents a ray of hope for many citizens living under the iron fist of the SED. It provides a way for them quietly and discreetly slip into the West, such as by buying their way out. 

A crazy four weeks 

The situation comes to a head on 26 June 1984. 55 East Germans, including 13 children, occupy the mission, which Berliners call the ""White House"", demanding exit permits. Inge Albrecht was 20 at the time. In 2014 she recalls: ""The worst thing was not knowing how long we'd be in this situation (...) and would it even work?"" 

For four weeks in 1984, the former Permanent Mission, which you can visit today at Hannoversche Straße 28-30, was bursting at the seams. Conditions quickly deteriorated, as former deputy director Hans Otto Bräutigam recalls: ""We cleared out the offices and laid out mattresses on the fifth floor (...) The atmosphere was explosive"". For a while, the Mission had to abandon its principle of always being open to visitors.  

The Permanent Mission regularly hits the headlines 

On 16 February 1989, a family crashed their Trabant through the barriers outside the Mission, but they were still allowed to leave. The Mission had to close its doors again on 8 August 1989, when 131 GDR citizens occupied the building.  

Today, a plaque at the former east entrance commemorates the escape route that led people to freedom before 3 October 1990.  

And what about the occupiers in 1984? The story has a happy ending - after tough negotiations between East and West, they were all granted permission to leave in July. Inge Albrecht was one of the last to leave the Permanent Mission.
",,"The Mission had a room that was protected from wiretapping, known as the Laube, the arbour. If staff wanted to leak information, they made sure they talked about it elsewhere in the building. This is what happened when the Mission was occupied in 1984. Hans Otto Bräutigam wanted the GDR to give in so he overdramatised the situation on the phone, knowing that the Stasi would be listening in.

",,,"A courage born of desperation
27 February 1943, a bitterly cold evening. The former Jewish community building is located near Hackescher Markt. Now, the building is in the hands of the Gestapo and SS. A small crowd of women are waiting outside, huddling together to keep warm. To begin with, there is only silence. Then the women start shouting - ""Give us back our men!"" The shouts grow ever louder: ""We want our men back!"" Demonstrating without permission is strictly forbidden, but the women remain there waiting. Their husbands are locked up inside.

The Factory Action  

In early 1943, the Nazi authorities launch a large-scale campaign to round up the remaining German Jews and deport them to Auschwitz. The Gestapo and SS close in to haul the men off. In Berlin, they arrest around 8000 Jews at their places of work, taking them directly to a series of designated assembly points. Later, those arrested call this raid the ""factory action"". Under the Nazi regime's racial laws, 2000 of those arrested are spouses in ""mixed marriages"" - largely Jewish men married to non-Jewish women. The Gestapo herd the men into the Jewish community building in Rosenstraße. Family members desperately try to contact their loved ones locked inside. The building hardly has any toilet facilities and no places to wash. The stench in the rooms sticks in the throat. In the corridors and rooms, the men can only sit, stand and sleep in turns. 

You are at an advertising pillar in front of the building at Rosenstraße Nr. 2-4. This kind of advertising pillar was also here in 1943. A small girl stands in front of it, looking anxiously upwards. In the bitter cold, her tears freeze as they trickled down her face. There is a man at the window of the third floor - her father Abraham Pisarek, a photographer. He waves to her. He's received the sandwiches that Ruth and her mother manage to give to a guard. Inside the pack of sandwiches, they have hidden a slip of paper with a loving message.  

A courage born of desperation 

Several days go by, and the women are still standing in front of the building in Rosenstraße - and so is the girl. They refuse to move, even when the Gestapo threaten them with guns. After six days, the first men are released. Ruth Pisarek throws her arms around her father. He is thin, unshaved and looks exhausted - but he has an official notice of release.  

Does the women's protest in Rosenstraße lead the Gestapo to release the men? Historians still dispute the demonstration's effect - but no one disputes the women's courage at this difficult time. They risked their lives to save their men. This was the only public demonstration against the deportation of German Jews in wartime Nazi Germany. 

The building used to incarcerate the men is destroyed in the war. Today, the site is a small greened space. If you head for Alexanderplatz square, you'll find a memorial by the sculptor Ingeborg Hunzinger dedicated to the discrimination against Jews and this courageous protest.

",,,"Propaganda creates martyrs
14 January 1930. The woman renting the little apartment in Große Frankfurter Straße 62 has quarrelled with her lodger again. Now, she's off to the corner pub to get reinforcements. The Communists there know who her lodger is - the ""Nazi boss of Alexanderplatz"". His real name is Horst Wessel, long a thorn in the side of the Communists. They are only too happy to work him over. When Wessel comes home, a few muscular Communists are waiting with a special greeting. Then, a few shots ring out. Hit by a bullet in the face, Wessel falls to the floor.

The propaganda machine creates a martyr 

The nearest hospital in the working-class district of Friedrichshain is not far from the scene of the shooting. Badly injured, Wessel is rushed through the impressive hospital gateway straight to the operating theatre. His life is saved by an emergency operation, but he dies of blood poisoning on 23 February 1930. Joseph Goebbels jots down three words in his diary, ""A new martyr"". Immediately, he begins to plan how Wessel's death can best serve the Nazi propaganda machine.  

From pastor's son to confirmed Nazi  

Horst Wessel is the son of the Lutheran pastor at the traditional St Nicholas Church in Berlin. Even as a young man, Wessel joins groups in nationalist 'völkisch' circles. When he is 19, he becomes a member of the NSDAP - the Nazi Party. Quickly gaining the reputation of an effective speaker, he is seen as someone capable of whipping up emotions for the party. Only Joseph Goebbels, Gauleiter (district leader) of Berlin, gives more public speeches in the city. On 1 May 1929, Horst Wessel takes over as head of the SA troop in Friedrichshain - a district well known as a Communist Party stronghold.  

With his brown shirts, Wessel enthusiastically implements a policy of street fights and brawls in pubs and taverns. Wessel sets out to be provocative - and succeeds. His SA troop are always active. They openly march to music through the streets. He also adapts the Communist tradition of workers' songs, and has his SA troop play them on shawms, a piercing wind instrument. Wessel even composes new words to an old traditional melody: ""Raise the flag / The ranks tightly closed / The SA marches calm and steady"".  

The Communists long to teach Wessel a lesson - and on 14 January 1930, they act. But it remains unclear if the clash with Wessel is just for political reasons, or if there is a private agenda. The Communist newspaper Die Rote Fahne claims Wessel is a pimp, killed in a fight in that milieu. But the German Communist Party (KPD) cannot stop the Nazis turning Horst Wessel into a martyr.  

With the seizure of power on 30 January 1933, Hitler and the Nazi regime raise their hero cult around Horst Wessel to a state cult. A guard of honour is placed at the scene of his shooting, and his death becomes a vehicle for solemn appeals to the public. Streets, squares and schools are named after him - and Friedrichshain is officially renamed Horst-Wessel-Stadt. Die Fahne hoch (Raise the Flag), Wessel's battle song from 1929, becomes the ""second German national anthem"". 

In October 1933, the hospital in Friedrichshain is named the Horst Wessel Hospital. The building is nearly entirely destroyed in the war. The only original parts remaining today are the impressive entrance and several outbuildings. Otherwise, Vivantes Hospital Friedrichshain is now distinguished by its buildings from a more recent past.

30 October 2008. A loud roaring sound echoes across the air field. Not far from where you are now, a Douglas DC-3 takes off. Its silver-coloured wings wiggle slightly, as if waving goodbye. Dubbed a Candy Bomber by locals, the plane evokes the historic Berlin Air Lift. The Douglas DC-3 flies off into the sky over Berlin - the last aircraft to take off from Tempelhof Airport. On this day, the airport is officially decommissioned - and after a flight lasting just a few minutes, the Candy Bomber lands at Schönefeld Airport.

The gateway to the free world 

In the Cold War, Tempelhof Airport stands as a guarantor of freedom. In 1948, the Soviet army seals off the sectors of Berlin under the Western Allies. With only the air route open, the Allies launch an air lift through Tempelhof Airport. As the Candy Bombers bring in relief supplies for West Berlin's residents, Tempelhof Airport becomes the ""gateway to the world"". It develops into an inner-city transport hub, a place where many travellers would take off and land in years to come. Tempelhof Airport is finally closed on 30 October 2008 - fuelling a protracted debate on what Berlin should to do with the site. The promising project of an urban park is called Tempelhofer Freiheit - ""Tempelhof Freedom"".  

An urban park for all Berlin 

On 8 May 2010, the new park opens. It is an unforgettable experience - just as it still is today when you step onto the Tempelhofer Feld, as the park is now called. Initially, ten access routes lead into this vast site - one of the world's largest open free spaces in any inner city. The park's size is awesome - 300 hectares, enough space for around 420 football pitches. Or put another way - seven times as large as the Vatican City. Tempelhofer Feld park is open for all. Here (almost) everything is allowed - from skating to strolling, urban gardening, picnicking, chilling, kite surfing, bird watching and much more. Take a look around. The leisure activities are supplemented by a community garden, a bicycle repair shop, and a Theater der Welten theatre project. Today, the striking airport buildings, now with heritage status, regularly host major trade fairs and music events.  

In 2014, a referendum is held on the park's future use. The Berlin Senate wants to allow perimeter developments with apartments, a library and commercial real estate. Many Berlin residents see this as the beginning of the end of their freedom on the spreading Tempelhofer Freiheit park. The referendum leaves no doubt. The Berliners vote overwhelmingly to preserve the entire Tempelhof Feld park - their playground and experimental ground. What the future holds for this vast free space depends on the courage and inventiveness of Berlin's policymakers.

The world's longest open-air gallery is being created in Berlin. It's the first art project to be undertaken by a united Germany since the fall of the Berlin Wall and attracts artists from all over the world. The East Side Gallery opened in Berlin-Friedrichshain on 28 September 1990, and it is still one of the city's most popular sights.

The Wall has gone! Well, almost. The border posts have been torn down, but kilometres of concrete wall are still snaking through the city. East and West Germans and visitors from all over the world descend on Berlin in the hope of taking home a little piece of the Wall. They hack at the monstrous construction with hammers, chisels and pneumatic drills. The GDR's border guards and Bundeswehr take care of the rest. They tear down the Wall, the symbol of Germany's division.  

A symbol of separation becomes a work of art 

Just a few sections of the wall remain, including a long stretch on the banks of the Spree. In spring 1990, this provides the perfect canvas for artists from Germany and around the world.  

West Berliners have been covering the wall with their paintings and graffiti for years, but in the East people were kept away from the border by barbed wire and self-firing weapons. Now they have been given permission to paint by the GDR Council of Ministers.  

For six months, the area between Oberbaumbrücke and Ostbahnhof reeks of paint. 118 artists from 21 nations help to create the open-air gallery. The air is abuzz with different languages. In 1990 Berlin is on the move. Everyone is gripped by a mood of change; the city feels electric. The East Side Gallery provides a space for free expression.  

Freedom, peace, breaking down barriers - the artists immortalise these themes in their fantasy-filled paintings on the remains of the Wall. The concrete canvas stretches for 1.3 kilometres. The monument of terror is transformed into a vibrant work of art. Berlin's residents and visitors look on in amazement - as you are doing now.  

Trabis and fraternal kisses 

There's so much to see, from surreal images to political statements. Dimitri Vrubel depicts a brotherly kiss between Honecker and Brezhnev, while artist Birgit Kinder ""makes dreams come true through painting"" A Trabant smashes through the wall, symbolising East Germany's Peaceful Revolution of 1989. It's called Test the Best. On its journey to the West, the Trabi discovers the best of this new world. 

But the East Side Gallery quickly begins to crumble, attacked by souvenir hunters, vandals and air pollution. It has been restored regularly over the years. Some works have been sandblasted, others have been repainted and given a special coating. As of 2018, the Berlin Wall Foundation is to take over the maintenance and preservation of the East Side Gallery.

Marsano’s candles abide by the same principle: their high-quality Swiss stumps have a burning time of around 180 hours. Tonight (22.11.2018, 17h) marks the official opening of the Advent exhibition: Now’s the time to nab the most beautiful wreaths (and enjoy a glass of wine). P.S. Should you stop by Friday, you’ll have the chance to take home a bit of non-floral deco, too — thanks to a Black Friday discount of 20% on all non-Christmassy objects, furniture and accessories.

Custom wall textiles in neutral tones, hand painted with delicate flowers complement Mid Century furniture and low lighting, allowing Agnona’s sartorial offerings room to breathe. The brand, which started out as a purveyor of fine fabrics to haute couturiers like Dior, Balenciaga and Yves Saint Laurent, has since become a prêt-à-porter label, today under the creative direction of Simon Holloway. In its new Berlin store — the “Agnona Apartment” — customers are invited to browse through items on gilded racks, take a seat on elegant low-slung seats to peruse hefty tomes of fashion photography for inspiration, and of course try on new season finds that catch their eye. Agnona’s Spring/Summer 2018 collection is a nod to the pastel world of David Hockney, and pops with vibrant gradients and California-inspired tones joining florals on kimono coats made from the world’s finest “Century Cashmere”, silk crêpe de chine and shiny viscose dresses.

I’m no specialist, but I do think this hidden part of Berlin provides space for contemplation. That’s why I like to come to Il Calice, read, have a glass of wine and enjoy the sun that bathes the square in light well into the evening. The philosopher Walter Benjamin, alas, had no affiliation to the square, as his family lived further south in Wilmersdorf.

The bread itself comes in an array of shapes and grains, but you’ll find no typical German Brötchen here – only huge, crusty-on-the outside, fluffy-on-the-inside loaves. The bakers put the first batch in the oven at six in the morning, meaning a steady stream of locals are drawn in by the irresistible smell of fresh loaves as the doors open one hour later. There’s also a mouthwatering selection of fresh croissants, cinnamon rolls and the best raspberry slices in the city!

Founded in 2007 by Alex Cafetzakis, it is rightly called Bar Italia. The owner’s obvious passion for Italian culture expresses itself through coffee, food and filmography, and he has indeed managed to get all those ingredients into an undeniably small, but charming and cozy space. That’s probably why Bar Italia manages to distinguish itself from the other cafés nearby. The owner’s main goal is to deliver what he considers a great coffee; he searched hard to find Bar Italia’s special blend, Pasucci, which he located in a secluded Italian village and brought back to Berlin. This elegant yet powerful bean has been produced for many generations by a family which still lives in the mountains, and guards the secrets of their work. If you decide to stop by in the early hours of the day, you’ll understand that the café creates a special atmosphere. If you’re lucky, the sun will shine through the small windows, the aroma of coffee will fill the space, and despite the back and forth movement coming from the nearby traffic lights, you’ll feel like time is on hold whilst sipping on a perfect cup of coffee. I haven’t found a better way to start my day!

It’s enough to grab a French bite at La Maison and indulge in the artistic specialties of the land of joie de vivre. Here, there are strawberries on the bottom of the cakes, the brioche is covered with cheese, and the rhubarb is served on small tarts. The dark concrete slabs throughout the space serve as works of art in themselves. Once you take a seat in one of the dark wooden chairs, all carefully sourced from flea markets in France, you’ll already feel far away from the noise of the nearby construction. Anyone who wants to savor a little feeling of France simply has to tuck into a fresh croissant, dip it into a little coffee and soak up the sun.

Some varieties can be enhanced with pieces of Swiss chocolate to add some bite. For those who can’t make up their mind, a sampler cup with six miniature scoops is on the menu.

Making my way to the back, I walked into a cozy room furnished with a piano and an antique grandfather clock where I found a large selection of English and Turkish literature along with children’s books and second-hand books.

Upon moving to Berlin from Los Angeles, they immediately opened their store 1213bst on Rosa-Luxemburg-Straße in 2017 with the aim of establishing a platform for diversity and sustainability. The idea behind the store is both persuasive and simple: The duo buys clothes, shoes and accessories from trading customers. But unlike the typical second-hand store, the seller can choose to receive either cash in hand or an in-store trade credit. The newest addition to their concept is the online shop 1213bst.com. Their brick-and-mortar location’s interior is tastefully designed with subtle details. Generous amounts of white space and light woods create a positive and carefree atmosphere that makes everyone feel welcome.

With Click & Surr, owner Jürgen Lossau has his finger on the pulse of the times. While everything around us is becoming more and more digital, a societal longing for the technology and aesthetics of decades past has quietly been emerging. No wonder: analog photography is neither about perfection, nor about an infinity of possibilities.

The delectable sweet treats she whips up include traditional Victoria sponge, red velvet cupcakes, poppy seed “Gugelhupf” and rose cake. The dollop of jam that is served with the cheesecake is handmade from fruit grown in her parents’ garden, and she sources her hazelnuts from her relatives in Turkey. Besides coffee, Topkara also offers freshly-brewed British tea specialties. In the display case sit heavenly multi-tier cakes which appear as edible works of art, garnished with pearls and fruit. In addition to the selection found in her café — which is only open on weekends — Topkara also bakes cakes made to order. Her customers can expect an individualized result which is almost too beautiful to eat. The native Schöneberger baker often makes personalized wedding cakes, which tell the story of the brides and grooms from around the world.

They have a rotating wine list but often stray from the menu. “We open what we feel at the time.” He uncorks a second wine, a vivid Malbec fermented with pressurized grapes. The focus at Dr. Maury remains wine, but the small plates are more than satisfactory, showcasing the duo’s background in gastronomy. Their chipped gouda with sugar beet reduction and onions is a careful orchestration of flavors that balance perfectly with the Jurancon Noir or something a bit more tannic like Château Peyrat. The creamy artichoke spread is also a must-try when you visit. “In France,” Olivier recounts, “wine used to be part of your wages.” That same knowledgeable but unfussy approach extends to their occasional events. They’ve held a blind taste test of natural wines as well as an exhibition of vintage skateboard stickers, so stay on the lookout for what’s next. Drop by for a glass of whatever’s pouring that night.

Walking in, a soothing, warm atmosphere sweeps over you, clearly inspired by Fenster Coffee’s founder Jasper Springeling and his colleague Jonathan Schneider. The duo met at Bonanza Coffee Heroes, where Jasper had been chief roaster. In coming weeks, Jasper will be creating a house blend (for both espresso and filter coffee) together with Fjord Coffee Roasters.

Faced with an utterly intriguing cocktail menu, I explained my taste preferences to the bartender and asked for his recommendation. I ended up with a very satisfying “Autumn Leaf”, an orange-based drink with gin and sherry.

Micha Köser’s Kønigliche Backstube lives up to its royal name — the passion for craftsmanship is palpable here. From the shopfront, where stacked loaves are ready to be sold, you have an excellent view into the kitchen, and can watch bakers make and knead the dough, taking in the feeling of old-school coziness and delicious scents. Kønigliche Backstube’s selection includes classics such as pane rustico, crusty French breads and artisan walnut loaves. Cakes aren’t to be found amongst the array of baked goods; here, fluffy raisin buns and juicy cinnamon rolls are the quintessence of a guilty pleasure. Micha, formerly of Beumer & Lutum, pays close attention to the quality of the preparation processes, striving to create dough that’s soft and a pleasure to eat, but also lasts for a few days. Little wonder, then, that this pint-sized bakery has such a loyal customer base. The atmosphere is welcoming and familiar, and commitment to the community extends to the walls: As part of the project “Einszueins – Kunst in der Køniglichen Backstube”, artists receive a daily loaf of bread in exchange for their work.

Opened in July 2017, owner Peter Edinger flew the coop from Weserstraße’s Tier Bar (where he was a former bartender) to bring his own vision to life. His home garden in Brandenburg is equipped with a Kräuterspirale – a twist (literally and figuratively) on the classic herb garden that makes efficient use of space, soil, water and sun for culinary and medicinal herbs. It was this concept that became the inspiration for a bar with an herb focused menu, realized in Herr Lindemann’s cocktails like the signature Ziegenpeter made with goat weed infused rum and the Thymian Fizz. If herbs aren’t your thing, don’t worry — you can still get excellently crafted classics, plus a selection of beer and wine. Settle in on the green velvet couches and you might just get addicted to this laid-back bar with elevated herbal cocktails.

For a year, the two friends had been searching for a place to open a cozy wine bar introducing Berliners to their favorite things from Italy, with small plates and hand-picked bottles from traditional vintners. The storefront, with its original East German neon sign, wallpaper and cabinetry, appealed to their sense of nostalgia and Nicola’s love of stamps. So this spring, Briefmarken Weine opened its doors, blending the store’s philatelic past with the owners’ flea market treasures. Its motto: “Grandi Vini, Piccola Cucina.” It’s a lovely place to while away the evening under the allee’s tall lindens. Pick a wine at whim from the handwritten menu, from a place you dream of visiting — Liguria? Sicily? — plus some incredibly fresh mozzarella or the pasta of the day. Time slows as one of the owners gently pours your wine, noting that it contains a whole season of Italian sun.

Even so, no one will be checking into their room here, but rather browsing design products from (un)known designers and (inter)national brands. The small café tucked away in the back of the shop serves freshly baked cakes and coffee. The unusually provocative concept was created by Mo Ghandehari, a fan of design and Depeche Mode.

A mix I didn’t know I needed in my life, until I stepped foot into Birra. Upon entering you’re greeted by a slew of Italian bartenders rambunctiously jockeying for space behind the bar. Italian craft beer is fascinating — many brewers actually develop their recipes with wine drinkers in mind, which leads to a strong focus on regionality, terroir, and spice. Beers by the Lambrate brewery, a pioneer of Italy’s craft beer movement, make up the core of the bar’s range. They’re flanked by offerings from many other young Italian breweries, as well as a few local ones (Stone and Motel). The bartenders are happy to help you find a beer you enjoy. When I told them I was a big fan of sour beer they plied with me everything they could find, including a taster of a tomato beer that they’d been working on. In order to sustain a solid night of beer, I highly recommend you order some snacks: Birra’s menu offers a delicious selection of fresh panini, charcuterie, cheese, and large, juicy olives.

Aside from freshly-baked brioche, pretty much all you’ll find here is really good specialty coffee, with beans rotating weekly based on origin and monthly based on roaster.

Or hold a meeting further in the back with a slice of cake (topped with whipped cream, old school-style) or enjoy a pint of beer at the massive brass counter until the early hours — and all that, seven days a week. No need to look up the opening hours beforehand. The whole thing feels honest, reliable and rooted in tradition, partly due to the timeless and minimalist yet homey furnishings. When the world seems to be turning too fast, Hackbarth’s is here to help you unwind. (Text: Markus Roll / Photos: Pamina Aichhorn)","Markus Roll worked as a pastor for twelve years.

The only café open in the empty Shabbat streets had one customer and two options: hummus and hummus with ful (a hearty paste of dried fava beans). I blindly chose the latter and was rewarded with a steaming bowl of hummus crowned with fragrant olive oil and ful — a light and perfect meal. Café Mugrabi brings such eye-opening (and palate expanding) Tel Aviv moments to Berlin, with thoughtful takes on a variety of Israeli staples: from hummus with spicy green skhug (an herby sauce) to sabich sandwiches stuffed with eggplant, smoky shakshuka to light fattoush salads and creamy labneh cheese with pita. More staid options — poached and scrambled eggs or granola with fruit — are invigorated with tahini, za’atar herbs or labneh, each dish anchored by Bonanza coffee and fresh juices. When I can’t decide, I order hamshuka, a delicious hummus-shakshuka hybrid. Get extra sourdough bread or pita to mop up the leftovers, but save room for malabi, a refreshing milk pudding with rosewater. Whether at an outside table soaking up sun or unwinding in the tiled interior, Café Mugrabi is a perfect springboard to greet your day.

Owners Robyn Anderson and André Gifkins bring this neighborhood-esque option to Neukölln, with a small, diverse array of rotating taps waiting to replenish your very own growler or smaller bottle. The onlooking shelves are filled with a colorful, curated variety of bottled and canned beer, focused on stars of the Berlin scene (e.g. Markthalle Neun’s Heidenpeters, Lenny’s Artisanal Ales), harder-to-get brews from farther afield and “whatever we want to try in the moment”, the owners admit.

With its cozy mix of mismatched furniture, exposed brick arches, paint-stripped tables, and retro lounge chairs coming apart at the seams, it’s easy to feel like you’re in someone’s lounge room – a crowded lounge room though, at a house party perhaps, with friends perched on every surface. After the generously poured whiskey sours, the best thing about Lerchen & Eulen is that it is always brimming with flowers. Flowers overflow from every corner – flowers in watering cans, flowers in old milk bottles on the tables, big bouquets shielding the barman from the sight of thirsty guests. No matter how late it gets, or how cloudy and sweaty the room is with smoke and bodies pressed together, the overwhelming smell is always fresh and floral. Being located next door to a florist, I always imagined this is where the leftover flowers ended up. But on the contrary, the owner goes weekly to the flower markets and spends hours doing floral arrangements around the bar. Fresh flowers and great whiskey sours, it’s a winning combination!

Simply talk to him or his team and let them come up with the perfect drink for you.

OK, so strictly speaking, Heide’s isn’t so much a café as it is a deli, according to owner Heide Proett. But instead of worrying about semantics, you should pay a visit to the magical shop on Rykestraße, where so many delicious things await that you’ll want to stay a while. And thankfully you can — on weekends, Heide — who, following a career in marketing and PR, has fulfilled her long-standing dream of opening an Italian deli — whips up an a delectable breakfast menu, from ricotta pancakes to poached eggs with crispy bacon and hazelnut vinaigrette. If the dishes weren’t so satisfyingly filling you could stay right on for lunch, indulge in an afternoon tea of homemade cake and then dive in to the insanely good spaghetti bolognese or mozzarella crostini. There are also lighter options like salad on the Italian evening menu, which changes frequently. The experience is topped off by a fine selection of wine and a smile from Heide and her team. Heide’s is a place to feel good in, to while away the morning with a good book, to bring your parents to, to have an aperitif at — all occasions are perfectly catered for. And if you want to take a slice of it home with you, pick up a treat from the deli wall, which is stocked with everything from olive oil to chocolate.

As the last of the sun’s peachy golden rays hit our table, we gazed at our fellow diners as they savored the dishes we so enjoyed. After one last glass — a musky, oak-aged Italian red (Le Coste’s Rusticone Rosso), available, as all their wines are, by the bottle to stay or go — we headed out into the late summer evening, the sky now as crimson as the wine still on our palettes.

Café Soba opened its doors and quickly established itself as a little haven between the hustle and bustle of Mauerpark and Kastanienallee. All delicacies, such as the lemon meringue pie or the goat cheese panini with fig mustard and walnuts, are homemade. A special recommendation for like-minded coffee fanatics is the organic coffee from Friedrichshain! Just to avoid all misunderstandings: the name Soba does not indicate the serving of Japanese buckwheat noodles in this case. Rather, Soba refers to the Serbo-Croatian background of Pero who opened the café together with Christin. In his mother tongue, Soba simply means “room”. Just another reason why Soba visitors feel right at home. (Photos: Benjamin Lindenkreuz)","Fri 9-18h, Sat-Sun 10-18h",,,https://ceecee.cc/en/sarah-mie-nass-recommends-soba/,https://ceecee.cc/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Cee-Cee-Berlin-Cafe-Soba.jpg,,,,

But in reality, Friedenau is simply waking from a deep slumber. Until the ’70s the area was quilted with a patchwork of bars, theatres, clubs, pubs, and cafés. Dimitris Christides, drummer and founder of the Drum School Berlin, along with Willi Hunz, are reviving these wild times, offering a platform for local and international musicians to perform. The small jazz club offers more than just great live music: Zig Zag’s delicious cocktails and creative tapas are the perfect accompaniment to any performance. Dimitris and Willi also helped set up a six-day jazz festival, Maggie Black’s Jazz Rub Festival, delivering a series of fantastic musical treats from first-rate musicians. Also worth mentioning is the free admission: instead of paying at the door, a hat is passed around at the end of the performance for donations, which we’re told is more lucrative for the musicians than charging entry.

The beetroot-horseradish version is a hit and the mountain-cheese-covered-and-grilled version is another great choice. Served on wooden plates (self-made of course) they look and taste like a good ol’ German dish, but extremely fine – the amount of bread and topping are perfectly balanced. As for me, I’d return in the afternoon just for the slightly salted chocolate cake in a glass — with some homemade elderflower syrup lemonade. If you choose to come in the evening, the bar is a nice place to hang out. We tried the matcha infused cocktail and were delighted!

Here, classic drinks are meticulously prepared, while others boast true inventive quality. Take the classic El Presidente, switched up with Don Papa rum from the Philippines, dry vermouth, a swish of orange Curaçao, grenadine, and orange peel, alongside a cheeky spoonful of caramel. Indulgent and irresistible, but also spirited. If you ask for a Negroni you will get one. If you ask for an Old Fashioned – expect no less than the original. The bar’s ambiance is sophisticated without being too dressed up; the music never too loud to steal attention away from the drinks.

The city caters to a myriad of different tastes, and there is constantly the opportunity to discover somewhere new to enjoy a meal. With this in mind, Vietnamese café Quà Phê should be next on your list. Opened in 2014 by Hong and her team, it’s somewhere that’s impossible to just grab a coffee; you’ll end up wanting to stay and enjoy the laid back and comfy atmosphere. The food ranges from Xoi dishes (rice based) to Goi dishes (salads), with desserts like the milky banh bao and sweet sticky rice. My personal highlight from the menu is the braised pork banh bao paired with a glass of Bundaberg ginger brew, with other meat and vegetarian banh bao options available. For something sweet, I recommend the che thap cam with mung beans, tapioca, coconut milk and taro: it tastes as delicious as it sounds. The standard summer rolls and pho soup are not part of the experience here, and instead you should expect a well curated selection of exquisite dishes, each tailored to perfection.

As unpretentious as its name — Die Bar — sounds, its interior is charming; its guests spirited. Even if actors, artists, entrepreneurs or charming self-promoters come and go, by the end of the night, a mixed crowd ends up sitting together at the bar, discussing the meaning of life and sharing their favorite tunes. The delightful owner, Nina Traiser, has an eye for interior design, which explains the special allure of this small establishment. Apart from its unique style, the bar offers a very small but fine selection of cocktails and an outstanding assortment of gins that will satisfy even the most discerning connoisseur.

Since then he’s produced the flat bread rolls on his own. Made out of wholemeal flour, yeast, oil, salt, and water, the dough is baked with a special iron in round ramekins for 15 minutes. Afterwards, it is traditionally covered with salami, cheese or yam; though Richard is flexible with toppings, letting the customers decide for themselves. Upon request, he cuts avocados and other vegetables for the sandwich, salts it, and squeezes just a little bit of lemon on top. The cream cheese and quince jelly version also makes for a perfect breakfast and tastes just right with Italian coffee. The best time for a visit is at breakfast or lunch.

Everything here is made in-house with organic nut milk, cocoa butter and coconut oil – and all without refined sugar. Then living in the Tribeca neighborhood of New York City, founder Klaus Zinsmeister sought to address the lack of tasty vegan ice cream and began trying his hand at ice cream recipes. His passion quickly became a profession and he quit his job in finance to open a pop-up ice cream shop in the USA. In 2017 Tribeca opened in Berlin, and Klaus runs the small, airy ice cream parlor together with his brother Frank and business partner Paul. Awaiting you at the shop are pastel-colored benches out front, offering the perfect shady spot for warm days.

My favorites are the bath salts with coconut milk, rosemary and rose petals and the three-step facial care set which includes a facial cleanser, a hyaluron moisturizing serum and a facial raspberry seed oil. The moisturizer and oil are sold separately, so you can decide what ratio of the two products to apply according to the season and time of day. The visionary spirit of the founders does not stop here: their idea is to develop natural cosmetics in an urban context of art, culture and city gardening, while staying true to their motto: “In editions we grow, in artists we invest!” This means collaborating with street artists like Neisscaps, whose special edition baseball caps are available at the Kreuzberg store.

For lunch and dinner, there’s pizza and salad, but also small plates like the hummus. LuLa’s house-baked cakes are not only delicious, but are also served in generous portions. Speaking of homemade, almost everything is produced on-site: from plentiful variations on sourdough and sweet preserves to pickled vegetables. “Think global, act local” is the mantra that owners Sarah and Robert Sever follow in everything they do — like listing their suppliers on their website. It’s hard to get more hyperlocal than their fruit and vegetables, which are delivered three times weekly from the Breslauer Platz Wochenmarkt the café looks out over. Market days, by the way, are my favourite time to visit LuLa. Depending on the weather, you can stretch out in the sunshine with a homemade lemonade on the terrace, or sip on a hot tea, all wrapped up in a blanket, and watch the hustle and bustle of market day action play out in the square.

Surrounded by flora and decor that seem to belong to a mythical place and time (or rather to the “new Berlin”), visitors sample small bites such as oysters and pumpkin chips. But most come for the drinks, with ingredients as experimental as you’d expect from a venue based on travel and exploration: radishes, red beets, lentils, bananas, and tarragon. Curiosity is at the heart of Janosch’s tale, and the same could be said about Tiger Bar’s offerings; meaning the more adventurous you are, the closer you’ll get to dreamland.

Based out of a small studio in Kreuzberg, the brand gives new life to otherwise rejected materials — Zazi’s one of a kind, handmade pieces are made solely from collected and vintage fabrics. Their last chapter utilized abandoned silk with colorful ikat patterns from Uzbekistan and Afghanistan for elegant dresses and cropped blouses made by the Saheli Women of the Institute for Philanthropy and Humanitarian Development. By supporting women empowering NGO’s, Zazi links women from all over the world through sustainable fashion.

"Danziger Str 118, Berlin",52.53617,13.4320201,Shop,2,TRUE,Chili & Paprika,ZEYNEP LOKMANOGLU RECOMMENDS: CHILI & PAPRIKA,,,"On a relatively sparse stretch of Danziger Str. is an unassuming flavor heaven — a Mexican and Latin American grocery store called Chili & Paprika. Stepping inside immerses you in a world of products that rarely make an appearance in Berlin. Beautiful bottles of mezcal and tequila line shelves. Various chilies cover an entire wall: serranos, jalapenos, chipotles, in adobo, plain, whatever your heart or recipe desires. There’s a candy section, a tortilla section, and even a Dias de Los Muertos altar. Owner Mathias Jung is a Berliner with no apparent relation to Mexico or anywhere else in Latin America. In fact, he tells me, he’s never even been there. His connection to the region comes from a love of chilies. Initially just a chili shop, Chili & Paprika grew over time with requests from the clientele — mainly Latin Americans living in Berlin. It now holds 600 unique products including specialty items like fresh queso from Oaxaca and fresh poblano and serrano peppers. Check it out to recharge on some color and a lot of heat.

Follow its lead, and you’ll be charmed to discover Zosse. Opened in June 2018 by Paul Seifert, this bucolic bar finds its home in a former blacksmith’s workshop. Records stretching back as far as 1888 describe how the original tenants forged horseshoes, hence the name Zosse – an old German word for horse. Once you’ve pushed past the large, barn-like doors, you’ll be greeted by wood-clad walls, soft candlelight and, in winter, a roaring wood-burning stove. Take a seat and pore over their toothsome list of house-made drinks and bar snacks while nibbling on their zesty popcorn. The newest addition to their menu and our personal favorite is the Old Islay Bramble Sour, a blend of whiskey and bramble liqueur (derived from blackberries). Across the courtyard from the main room is their retro smoking room, accented with industrial lamps, a typewriter, and daguerreotype photos. In summer, take a seat in the Biergarten and enjoy a drink al fresco.

",,,"Street art – created to be destroyed
A long queue snakes its way down the street. The office building is about to close its doors forever. It used to be the home of bankers and financial wizards, but for the last two months it has housed an urban art project. But now it's due to be demolished. The art project is called The Haus. The initiators of the project enthuse: ""This experiment will make history"". The street art will be displayed until the wrecking ball comes.

Freedom to create 

You're on the fourth floor of the building in Nürnberger Straße &not;- room 409. All around you, green moss covers the walls and is growing over tables and chairs. You can smell the moss. But more than that, you are assailed by the pungent scent of yoghurt. The artist Se&ntilde;or Schnu collected 200 kilos of moss from a military training area and stuck it to the walls with yoghurt. The day after the exhibition opened, the smell started to permeate the building. Now it has to be aired several times a day. 

Se&ntilde;or Schnu is one of 165 artists working in this five-storey building. The Haus is a truly multi-sensory project. The motor of a kebab skewer buzzes as it rotates a colourful metal sculpture. A dark tunnel full of fabric vines leads to a ghostly magic forest with neon-coloured leaves and fantasy figures. The miles of black and white tape that create a jagged pattern in the corridor make you feel quite dizzy.  

Every imaginable kind of urban art has come together here, including paintings and sculptures, graffiti and installations. The artists have unlimited scope. 

Freedom through transience 

A property developer kicked off the project when he asked Dixon, a group of street artists, to use the building. They invited their ""homies"" - fellow artists from all over the world - to come and join in. Before it was demolished, the office block was turned into a temporary gallery. This kind of transient use is typical of Berlin since its reunification. 

But this kind of space for artists is becoming increasingly scarce, which makes it all the more important for artists and property developers to work together at The Haus. The project opens its doors for two months. Admission is free, but visitor numbers are limited. Only 199 visitors are allowed into the building at one time. In the end, 78,000 visitors pass through its doors - a huge success for the initiators and artists.  

Visitors are not allowed to take photos of the artworks. The idea is that they should focus on the art, immerse themselves in the transience of the moment, and allow the images to become etched in their memory. At the end of the exhibition, the art is destroyed. By its very nature, street art is transient, and the same goes for The Haus.
",The building has been demolished,"Urban artist El Bocho is popular in Berlin for his massive portraits of women in pop art style. But he takes a more sober approach to his space in The Haus, taking down the neon ceiling lights. In a letter, he apologises for the fact that he needs lamps for his studio - and says thank you for the free space, biscuits and beer.

",,,"Daylight, fresh air and sunshine for all
""Peace and self-esteem"" This is how Alfred Döblin describes the feeling conveyed by the new estate's architecture in 1928. Like many others, the famous Berlin novelist makes a pilgrimage to Britz to sit on the terrace of cafe on the horseshoe crescent and gaze at the future of modern living. Döblin believes architect Bruno Taut's buildings are more than just the successful application of ideas on social housing. In the unostentatious grandeur of the architecture, he feels there is a force at work that will lead to the creation of a new, truly modern human being: ""It slowly has an educational effect, like a silent daily sermon.""

A new town in the meadows 

Britz is a large residential development that was built from scratch after 1925. Trade union housing cooperatives and civil servants' associations built 2,300 apartments on what had previously been fields and meadowland. The buildings designed by Bruno Taut and Martin Wagner for the trade union cooperatives came to represent a movement that was seeking to bring radical changes to urban life. ""Daylight, fresh air and sunshine"", combined with good transport connections, would encourage families to leave Berlin's dark, squalid tenements and move to the suburbs. For many new tenants, this is the first time they have enjoyed the luxury of their own bathroom, complete with running water. Some people find the bright colours of the interiors provocative, even shocking, but this is typical of Bruno Taut's work. 

It is mainly young families who move into the new apartments in September 1926. The spacious green areas make a perfect playground. Only the inside of the horseshoe is off limits. The original plan was to install a paddling pool with a sunbathing area and benches, but cost pressures led the local authorities to plant a hedge and instruct residents to keep off the grass. After all, Ordnung muss sein - order must prevail! But once a year the council allows them to hold a big summer party on the lawn. Then the estate turns into a model socialist community, with much waving of red flags and lusty renditions of the Internationale by workers' choirs.  

A residential community with 10,000 members 

Members of the residents' committee are elected annually to look after day-to-day matters. The estate's own weekly newsletter, the Wohngemeinschaft (residential community), provides a forum for airing disputes. Are residents allowed to paint or wallpaper their brightly coloured walls? Can they hang out their laundry to dry in the front garden on public holidays? Is it OK to listen to the radio with the window open? Can they allow their cats to roam freely and let their kids play naked in the garden? The small community of artists that grows up around the anarchist Erich Mühsam and the communist Heinrich Vogeler regularly comes into conflict with their less free-spirited neighbours.  

After 1929, the residents' disputes about their garden fences become increasingly political. The Communist Party tries in vain to undermine the residents' committee and publishes its own magazine called Die andere Wohngemeinschaft - the other residential community. The final summer party is held in July 1931, and now it's a purely social democratic event. Once the National Socialists gain power, the once so forward-looking community of the estate's early years is forced underground.

"Wilhelmstraße 45, 10117 Berlin",52.5116,13.3835,History,1,FALSE,Wilhelmstraße History Mile,"A political stage: the National Socialists turn Wilhelmstraße into their seat of power
",,,"The corridor of power
30 January 1933. Goebbels is in celebratory mood: ""We've done it. We're in Wilhelmstraße. Hitler is Reich Chancellor. It's like a fairy tale"". The NSDAP leaders are waiting for Adolf Hitler in the Kaiserhof Hotel. Outside, Wilhelmplatz is buzzing. Supporters, onlookers and journalists all wave, shout and surge forward when Hitler finally appears around noon. For months he has been living and working in this hotel in the government district. But this afternoon he's due to move across the street - into the Reich Chancellery.

""What does Wilhelmstraße say?"" This is the question European diplomats have been asking since the middle of the 19th century. Wilhelmstraße has been synonymous with political power since Bismarck, like Downing Street in London or the Quai d'Orsay in Paris. Wilhelmstraße has been the site of the official residence of the German head of state, the Reich President, since 1919. Now the National Socialists are taking over the Weimar Republic ministries that they so detest. But they don't only want to occupy these historic buildings. The new government is also planning to construct buildings that will reflect its grip on power.  

From democracy to dictatorship - the Wilhelmstraße History Mile 

The new Reich Chancellery, the Ministry of Propaganda, the Ministry of Aviation - three monumental government buildings are built on Wilhelmstraße over the next few years. Wilhelmstraße is now a corridor of power wrapped in red swastika flags. It is like a huge political stage, hosting regular mass rallies and parades. Most days, a crowd of onlookers gathers in the hope of catching a glimpse of Adolf Hitler. They shout up to the balcony of the Reich Chancellery: ""Dear Führer, please show yourself at the window!"". 

Little is left 

The Ministry of Propaganda and the Ministry of Aviation are the only National Socialist government buildings built after 1933 to survive the war. Most of the older buildings, the palaces and ministerial buildings of the government quarter are destroyed by Allied air raids during the Second World War, by street battles when it ends, and by demolition in the post-war period. 

The Wilhelmstraße History Mile open-air exhibition has 32 information boards providing details about the street's most important buildings. If you stand in Wilhelmplatz, you are approximately half way along the 2,400-metre-long History Mile. From here you really can see how dramatically the street has changed. You will no longer find a square surrounded by buildings. The Topography of Terror exhibition on Wilhelmstraße is close by.

",,,"The archive of a global art movement
The Bauhaus has gained mythical status - and not only among architecture buffs. The list of names associated with the Bauhaus revolution in architecture, art and design in the twentieth century include such luminaries as Walter Gropius, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Wassily Kandinsky, Marcel Breuer, Paul Klee, Johannes Itten, Marianne Brandt and Gunta Stölzl.

At present, the museum is closed. The main building is being refurbished and an annex by architect Volker Staab is under construction. The museum is scheduled to reopen in 2020. Until then, the collection is on show in the temporary Bauhaus-Archiv Museum für Gestaltung Charlottenburg. 

Functional designs for daily use

In 1919, the architect Walter Gropius establishes the Bauhaus in Weimar as a college of art and design. He adopts many of the principles and methods advocated by Henry van de Velde at the School of Arts in Weimar. At the Bauhaus, inspired by the idea of the medieval masons' guild, teachers (known as 'masters') and students (known as 'apprentices') seek to develop a new synthesis of the arts and crafts. In the Bauhaus training, the emphasis is on a new style of architecture, breaking with the historicist revivalist styles dominant in Germany at that time. As in the Deutscher Werkbund association of artisans, designers, artists and architects, the Bauhaus teachers and students create works and designs for production in series. Their goal is to make functional products for daily life affordable for all.

In 1925, with growing political and financial pressure from populist nationalist parties and the local government in Thuringia, the Bauhaus moves to Dessau. But some years after the move, the Bauhaus faces a similar situation again. In 1931, the Nazi Party wins a majority in the Dessau city council and forces through a resolution to close the Bauhaus the following year. In 1932, the Bauhaus moves to Berlin's Lankwitz district. This, though, is just an interlude. After the Nazi Party's seizure of power in early 1933, the political repression culminates in the Bauhaus being forced to close entirely. The dramatic developments in the last phase lead many of the Bauhaus students and teachers to emigrate.

Fast forward to 1955 and the opening of the Academy of Design in Ulm. There, art historian Hans Maria Wingler meets Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius. Wingler is fascinated by the history of the Bauhaus, and avidly collects Bauhaus documents and objects. In 1960, he establishes the Bauhaus-Archiv. Initially, the collection is to be presented in Darmstadt in a dedicated building designed by Gropius in 1964. However, due to lack of funding, this design is never built.

When the state of Berlin offers to host the institution, the Bauhaus-Archiv moves to the city. From 1971, the archive is provisionally housed in Charlottenburg, in the building now home to the Bröhan-Museum for art nouveau, art deco, and functionalism. Berlin had already agreed to finance a new building and provide a site - in Klingelhöferstraße, along the Landwehr Canal in Berlin's Tiergarten district. By then Walter Gropius has died, but his original design is modified for the new site by his former colleague Alexander Cvijanovic.

The Bauhaus-Archiv/Museum für Gestaltung finally opens in 1979. Since then the holdings have steadily grown, but the heart of the collection remains the personal papers and artistic estates, with their draft designs, manuscripts, and letters, originally collected by Hans Maria Wingler. The mission of the Bauhaus-Archiv/Museum für Gestaltung is to locate the history, practices and impact of this avant-garde movement of art, design and architecture in its international context.
",,"The Bauhaus-Archiv building still retains the memorable silhouette with shed roofs from Walter Gropius's original 1964 design. These distinctive roofs provide lighting inside the building without bright sunlight or hard shadows. The solution is simple and functional. But hardly surprisingly, given its rather futuristic look, Berlin's Bauhaus-Archiv was chosen as a location for filming the American sci-fi movie &AElig;on Flux.

",,,"The home of a Jewish charity becomes Adolf Eichmann's office
Adolf Eichmann is sitting in his second-floor office in Kurfürstenstraße. On 6 March 1942, he is meeting representatives of various state bodies to discuss the forced sterilisation of ""half-Jews"". In this building, the Office of Jewish Affairs, civil servants are organising and coordinating the murder of Jews throughout Europe.

Every five minutes, a number 100 bus drives past 115/116 Kurfürstenstraße. Bus route 100 is known as the tourist route because it goes past many of Berlin's main sights. But passengers rarely get off at Schillstraße because the attraction is actually the bus stop itself. It's the only bus stop memorial in Berlin. Information boards and photos tell people about the building that stood behind today's bus stop around 1940. 

A hotel was built on the site in the 1960s. The original building was built in 1910 to house a Jewish charity. This acted as a community centre where Jewish people could seek advice on everyday problems and attend plays and concerts. 

First take their freedom, then take their life 

The Nazis confiscate the building in 1939. In 1940 a Gestapo department, the Office of Jewish Affairs, moves into the building on Kurfürstenstraße. It soon becomes known as ""Eichmann's office"" after the department's head, Adolf Eichmann. 

This is where the Nazis organise the deportation of the Jews. It also issues specific directives affecting Jewish citizens who are still in Germany. The Office of Jewish Affairs orders Jews to wear the Star of David, prohibits them from using public transport and demands that they hand over their bicycles and cameras. Each directive chips away at their lives, removing another piece of their freedom. 

By March 1941, the Office of Jewish Affairs has new objectives. Now Eichmann's office is responsible for organising the annihilation of Europe's Jews. By the end of the war, six million people have been murdered in Nazi concentration and extermination camps. 

Adolf Eichmann's department is involved in every aspect. His staff coordinate the transportation of Europe's Jews to the labour and extermination camps. It is this department that ensures one of the greatest crimes in history runs like clockwork. 

Eichmann's office organises these deportations to the camps until the spring of 1945. After the war Eichmann flees to Argentina. The Israeli secret service track him down in 1950 thanks to the investigative work of Fritz Bauer, the Hesse district attorney. The key organiser of the Holocaust is sentenced to death in Jerusalem. 

The building in Kurfürstenstraße survives the war almost intact but is demolished in the 1960s to make way for the hotel that stands here today.

",,,"Manipulation instead of freedom of thought
9 November 1944. Thousands of locals are heading for Wilhelmplatz square. Some are carrying weapons, most are in civilian clothes. Young and old - grandfathers and grandsons. Many fathers and sons are still fighting on the front. Joseph Goebbels walks out onto the Propaganda Ministry balcony. On Voßstraße, Hitler's massive Reich Chancellery dominates the skyline. A vast banner hangs down the Propaganda Ministry façade. The message it bears is written large: ""Our Militia Fights for the Life and Freedom of Greater Germany!"" Underneath, Goebbels looks down at the waiting crowds. Then, he walks over to the microphone.

The Third Reich's military defeat has been certain for months. But the Nazi leadership is determined to fight to the last drop of blood. Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels is the ""Reich Commissioner for Total War Mobilisation"". He calls for unconditional sacrifice from the Volkssturm - the euphemistic name for a national militia comprising an army of badly equipped children and old men. Cannon fodder for Hitler's bloody final stage of the war.

Freedom of opinion in chains 

Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels belongs to the old guard of the Nazi party, joining in the very early years. In 1926, Hitler entrusts Goebbels with a challenging task. Goebbels is appointed Gauleiter (district leader) of Berlin. With the support of the local SA ""Brownshirts"", he begins to create and expand a Nazi power base in Germany's capital city, known as a left-wing bastion of social democrats and communists. With the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, he achieves his initial goal. Now, Goebbels aspires to a seat in Hitler's cabinet with his own ministry - and becomes head of the Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, one of the Nazi regime's key pillars. He can now sway public opinion almost at will.

The ministry's key tasks are the control of the entire German media - the press, broadcasting, visual arts, film and theatre. It is no longer possible to freely form an opinion. Aware of the power of wireless as a propaganda channel, Goebbels makes production of the affordable Volksempfänger (""people's receiver"") a priority. In no time, the locals have nicknamed this radio the Goebbelsschnauze, which roughly translates as ""Goebbels' gob"" - and it lives up to its name with an unbroken stream of propaganda.

Wilhelmplatz square disappears

In 1933, the Propaganda Ministry moves to Wilhelmplatz square into a large town house known as the Ordenspalais - the Palace of the Order of St. John. But with staff numbers rapidly growing, the building soon proves too small. Until shortly after the outbreak of war, architect Karl Reichle oversees a new monumental building with a series of annexes. Wilhelmplatz serves the Nazis as a central destination for their marches. Here, massed crowds also gather to listen to speeches by Goebbels and Hitler.

Towards the end of war, much of the complex is destroyed in bombing raids. The reconstruction has primarily focused on the tract of buildings designed by Reichle. When East Germany is founded, the building houses the National Front of the German Democratic Republic, a satellite party of the ruling SED. This also becomes the official residence of Wilhelm Pieck, the first president of the GDR. Today, the Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (BMAS) uses the sections of buildings once housing the Nazi Propaganda Ministry. Wilhelmplatz square, as shown on the historic photo, no longer exists.
",Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (BMAS); not open to the public.,"Goebbels is also responsible for the film industry - and renowned for his scores of affairs. At Babelsberg Studio, just outside Berlin, the state-controlled UFA company produces many of the movies. Reputedly, hardly any actress there is safe from the ""randy old goat of Babelsberg"", as Goebbels is nicknamed - at least, until Hitler decides this is harmful to the party, and orders Goebbels to clean up his act.

This is not a site of freedom. This was the location of the central Nazi institutions of terror. From 1933, those brought here, violently taken into custody, had no hope. The site comprises the Gestapo headquarters and Security Service, and later the Reich Security Main Office of the notorious SS. Today, you can explore the history of the site at the Topography of Terror exhibition.

A place of terror  

The area around Wilhelmstraße develops from the eighteenth century. Before 1933, it can boast elaborate town residences, the ethnological museum, an Arts and Crafts College and the exclusive Hotel Prinz Albrecht. Prussia's renowned architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel and landscaper Peter Joseph Lenné design the adjacent square.  

On 8 November 1934, Reich SS Leader Heinrich Himmler takes over the Hotel Prinz Albrecht with his personal command staff. Himmler also moves the SS Administrative Main Office here as well as the SS Central Office and the SS Personnel Main Office. The Prinz Albrecht complex, as it is called, is home to the Gestapo headquarters, the SS Security Service and later the SS Reich Security Main Office. Himmler is a leading figure in the Nazi hierarchy. He systematically fights all those critical of the Nazi regime. As Reich SS Leader and Chief of the German Police, Himmler plays a key role in supporting Hitler's machinery of power. From here, with its system of concentration camps, the Nazi regime implements its policies of the persecution and extermination of political and ""racial"" opponents in the German Reich and occupied territories. Here too, plans are forged for the mass murder of European Jews and the war of ideologies and extermination in eastern and south-eastern Europe. 

Today, no buildings are left on the site from the pre-war period. Instead, the site is home to an exhibition and a Documentation Center. Go through the main entrance to the Topography of Terror exhibition next to the Martin-Gropius-Bau building, and walk down the steps. You are now standing in the former Prinz-Albrecht-Palais basement. Almost as soon as Hitler seizes power, these cells are packed with political prisoners. The Gestapo have 38 solitary cells and one communal cell in their headquarters, and often use brutal torture methods to interrogate the prisoners. In the twelve years of the Nazi regime, over 15,000 prisoners pass through these cells. After interrogation, many of the prisoners are sent to the concentration camps. 

The traces of the past 

Take a look behind the Martin-Gropius-Bau building. Here too there are traces of Berlin's history. You can see the remains of former buildings on the site and the prison walls. At the end of the little used path through a copse of locust trees, you can find the remains of two monumental structures for the Reich Security Main Office.

The plenary hall ceiling is decorated with symbols of truth, justice and freedom. But justice and freedom are not on the agenda today in the plenary hall of the Court of Appeal at Kleistpark. The People's Court meets here on 21 August 1944. The accused are said to be conspirators in an attempt to assassinate Hitler on 20 July. Roland Freisler, President of the People's Court, raises his arm in a Nazi salute. Ulrich Wilhelm Count Schwerin von Schwanenfeld, one of the accused, is led into the room. The trial begins.

The Volksgerichtshof (People's Court) 

In 1934, the Nazi regime establishes a ""People's Court"" to ""combat the enemies of the state"". The court is set up in the wake of the Reichstag fire trial in late 1933. There, the presiding judge in the Reichtsgericht, the highest German court, acquits four of the five accused. Hitler is furious, and decrees that future cases of treason can only be heard by the People's Court - a new political court. At first, the court is housed in the Prussian state parliament building. In 1935, it moves to a former school building at Potsdamer Platz. But in July 1944, Roland Freisler, President of the People's Court, asks for a prestigious building as a showplace for the trials of those involved in the plot against Hitler's life. The building at Kleistpark housing the Court of Appeal dates from the Wilhelmine period. The entrance is daunting, a symbol of authority. The main hall is resplendent and large.  

Hitler has no doubts about Roland Freisler, who is well-known as a ""hanging judge"". He will ""...make sure it all goes smoothly."" After all, Hitler's loyal rabble-rouser has been President of the People's Court since 1942, mercilessly passing down the sentences Hitler wants. For the trial against the conspirators in the assassination attempt, the Nazis come up with a special idea - a camera secretly filming the trial through a small hole in the swastika flag behind Freisler. The film material shows Freisler screaming at the accused, mocking and humiliating them.  

For freedom - with composure and dignity 

When Count Schwerin von Schwanenfeld tries to explain the reasons for his actions, Roland Freisler screams at him, ""You really are a low scoundrel!"". The film material is never released. Goebbels and the Nazi propaganda machine want scenes of the accused breaking down under Freisler's merciless contempt and ridicule. Yet despite Freisler's vitriolic performance, they seek to retain their composure and dignity.  

The People's Court also sentences Count Schwerin von Schwanenfeld to death. Between 1934 and 1945, the People's Court hands down sentences in 18,000 cases. The court's horrific record includes around 5,000 death sentences. One perversion of justice after another by the Nazis supported by lawyers and judges sympathetic to their cause creates a regime of open terror. 

Freisler dies during an air raid on 3 February 1945. The court house in Bellevuestraße is hit, and he is buried under falling masonry. The building is totally destroyed and never rebuilt. Today, the site is marked by a memorial plaque in the ground commemorating the victims of the People's Court.  

The Court of Appeal at Kleistpark survives the bombing raids. Initially, the Russian army liberating the city uses the building as a pigsty. Soon afterwards, it provides the setting for the constituent meeting of the International Military Tribunal of the Nuremberg trials. It also becomes the seat of the Allied Control Council until 1948. Today, it is once again home to the Berlin Court of Appeal.

",,,"Hitler’s personal prisoner
The Gestapo are standing in his living room. On the fateful morning of 1 July 1937, Father Martin Niemöller, one of the founders of the Confessing Church, has no choice but to go with the Gestapo. He is taken to Moabit remand prison. ""Now crush him so that he can't hear or see. Never let him go"", says propaganda minister Goebbels. Six months later Niemöller is on trial for sedition.

Martin Niemöller's life has been full of twists and turns. The son of a Protestant pastor, he became a U-boat commander in the First World War. In 1931 he was appointed pastor of Dahlem, a suburb of Berlin. At first he welcomes the Nazi's accession to power in 1933, but later objects to their interference in church affairs. Together with Dietrich Bonhoeffer and other pastors, Niemöller sets up the Pfarrernotbund, an organisation of pastors to combat discrimination against Christians and Jews. They also establish the Confessing Church, a Protestant group that opposed the Nazification of Germany's Protestant churches. As Christians, they are opposed to totalitarianism, the appropriation of the Gospel for political purposes, and the Nazis' racial ideology. Niemöller is a threat to Hitler, so he's arrested and put on trial. 

On 2 March 1938, he is sentenced to seven months in prison, but his time at the remand prison is taken into account, so he is free to go. Hitler is furious. Niemöller's family are waiting for him outside the prison gates, but the Gestapo smuggle him out of the back and take him to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. 

Martin Niemöller becomes a ""personal prisoner of the Führer"". But he's better off than most of the other prisoners. Joseph Goebbels says: ""Niemöller should eat well and get fat so no-one can continue to call him a martyr. But he is not to be let loose on mankind."" 

Thousands of protest letters are sent to the Chancellery, but the Nazis won't let him go. In 1941 Niemöller is transferred to Dachau, where he is liberated by American soldiers shortly before the end of the war. 

Martin Niemöller has become a pacifist. He criticises the establishment of the Federal Republic of Germany and opposes rearmament. In the USA, school children learn the now famous words of Pastor Niemöller: ""First the Nazis came for the Communists and I did not speak out, because I wasn't a Communist. Then they locked up the Social Democrats and I did not speak out, because I wasn't a Social Democrat. Then they came for the trade unionists and I did not speak out, because I was not a trade unionist. Then they came for me - and there was no one left to speak for me."" 

You are standing in front of Martin Niemöller's parsonage in Dahlem. It hardly changed since it was built in 1910. It reopened in June 2018 after renovations. In the 1980s it was turned into a centre for peace and education.  

Today, the historic building is a place of learning and a memorial to the Protestants who resisted the Nazis. Along with St Anne's Church, the churchyard and the parish hall, the parsonage is a tangible reminder of dark days in German history.

",,,"Organising the genocide of the European Jews
We are in front of one of the magnificent villas along the Wannsee lake. It is Tuesday, 20 January 1942 - and very cold. With temperatures around minus 13 Celsius, the lake is frozen. The garden is covered in a white layer of snow. From here, you have a view over the water to the bathing beach on the opposite shore. The smell of freshly-brewed coffee wafts over from the mansion's kitchen. There is fine cognac and cigars waiting for the guests. But first, there is work to be done. The letter of invitation is for ""a meeting, to be followed by lunch"". The meeting, planned for 90 minutes, is to coordinate policies on the destruction of the European Jews.

This meeting goes down in history as the Wannsee Conference. The host is Reinhard Heydrich, Head of the Security Police and Security Service. The lakeside villa is originally owned by an industrialist. In 1941, Heydrich arranges for it to be bought and turned into a guest house for the SS. On 20 January 1942, Heydrich is waiting for 15 high-ranking civil servants, State Secretaries and SS functionaries. Heydrich opens the meeting at noon. He begins by announcing his appointment as ""Plenipotentiary for the Preparation of the Final Solution of the European Jewish Question"". All the points on the agenda deal with the ""Final Solution"", the genocide of the European Jews. But that genocide is not decided at this meeting - it is already in full swing. 

The machinery of death is running flat out. Here, Heydrich's aim is to perfect the organisation and coordination of the ""Final Solution"" under his leadership. During the meeting, the participants clarify responsibilities for deportations and the procedures in the occupied territories. They discuss what to do with the estimated eleven million Jews across Europe, both in countries occupied by the German forces as well as those not yet invaded.  

The minutes of the Wannsee Conference leave no doubt about the fate of the Jews. They are to be ""utilized for work in the East in an expedient manner"", primarily for building roads. During that time, a ""large proportion will no doubt drop out through natural reduction"". The ""remnant [...] will require suitable treatment; because it will without doubt represent the most [physically] resistant part"". 

The meeting ends after 90 minutes. Later, Adolf Eichmann reported that it was conducted very quietly and with much courtesy, with much friendliness - nicely and politely. Eichmann is head of the Department of Jewish Affairs in the Gestapo, and takes the minutes of the meeting. Now, the meeting is over and it's time for the meal and a cigar.  

The key document  

The 15-page minutes of the meeting are on show in the dining room of the villa, today the House of the Wannsee Conference, Memorial and Educational Site. Eichmann's minutes are a key document on the organisation of the genocide of the European Jews - but one very nearly denied to posterity. Thirty copies of the minutes are prepared, all bearing a stamp reading ""Secret Reich Matter"", the equivalent of ""Top Secret"". Shortly before the end of the war, those responsible decide to destroy these incriminating documents. Just one copy survives - given to Martin Luther, who represented the Foreign Office at the Wannsee Conference. Luther falls from grace and, from 1943, is interned in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. His documents are confiscated to prepare the case against him - which is why they survive. Today, the original copy of the minutes is in the Foreign Office archive, in the vaults of the former Reichsbank.

",,,"Democrats by conviction
23 March 1933. SA and SS troops march through the main hall of the Kroll Opera House. After the Reichstag building burns down on 27 February, the German parliament is moved just a few hundred metres to this former theatre and opera house. Swastika flags hang from the ceiling, the sound of marching boots resounds through the hall. The inaugural meeting of the newly elected German parliament is about to start.

In this meeting, the Reichstag members strip themselves of their powers. Some have already fled the Nazis, others are arrested. The governing coalition of Hitler's National Socialists and the German National People's Party, the Centre Party, Bavarian People's Party and the German State Party all vote for the Enabling Act. This act, officially entitled ""Law to Remedy the Distress of People and Reich"", suspends the democratic constitution of 1920s Germany. It grants Hitler and his government extensive power and is the basis for all the Nazi regime's legislation. 

The last free speech in the Reichstag parliament 

Shortly before 6 pm, Otto Wels, leader of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), stands up to speak. ""You can take our lives and freedom, but you cannot take our honour."" It is the last free speech in the Reichstag. His words are applauded by the few SPD representatives in the hall. In this difficult hour, they fight for their democratic convictions. From the rows of the Nazi party delegates, the only sound is derisive laughter. The SPD is the only party that refuses to vote for the Enabling Act. The Communists would also have voted against Hitler, but many are already arrested. They have been stripped of their seats in parliament ""by decree"". Almost immediately after the Enabling Act is passed, the SPD is banned. 

After his courageous speech, Otto Wels flees to France. The Enabling Act marks the end of a democratic constitution under the rule of law. For many elected representatives of the democratic parties, especially in the SPD and the Communist party, it ushers in long years of suffering through persecution and suppression under the Nazi regime.  

Democrats against Hitler 

As the Second World War enters its final phase, the Nazi regime wants to settle old scores with all its opponents on the German political scene. There is a new wave of arrests. This time only a few survive imprisonment. Most of the former parliamentarians die in the Sachsenhausen and Buchenwald concentration camps. 

Rudolf Breitscheid is one of the most prominent SPD politicians also incarcerated in these camps. His supporters applauded him for his speeches and policy of reconciliation with France - exactly why the Nazis hate him.  

In March 1933, Breitscheid emigrates to France. On 10 May 1940, the German forces invade. The Gestapo arrest Rudolf Breitscheid in February 1941, deporting him and his wife to the Sachsenhausen and Buchenwald concentration camps. In August 1944, Rudolf Breitscheid dies during an American air raid. Today, many are unaware of his fate, but his name is still well known, commemorated in the name of the Breitscheidplatz square next to the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church.  

Today, when you approach the visitors' entrance of the Reichstag building from Tiergarten Park, you'll notice 96 cast iron plates set in the pavement. The plates, rather reminiscent of gravestones, bear the names and dates of 9 women and 87 men, together with the name of their political party.

",,,"Queuing for a little bit of freedom
Once the Wall falls, many people in the GDR have one wish — to stand on Berlin's legendary Ku'damm boulevard! Renowned as the 'West's shop window', here they can find everything they've dreamt of over the last 28 years. And so for many East Germans, their first visit to the West begins with a traffic jam.

On 10 November 1989, the entire boulevard is packed with East German Trabbis. The colourful shop windows and neon adverts contrast sharply with the Trabbi cars in matte bali yellow, reed green and dolphin grey. Everywhere, there are throngs of people, all come to experience the wonder of western consumer goods for themselves.

Shopping? First - a coffee!

In the days after the Wall falls, Kurfürstendamm's ""Kranzler Eck"" corner is buzzing - far more than for ages. For many older people in the crowds, a coffee and piece of cake in the historic Café Kranzler is a journey into the past. For the younger ones, just standing on Ku'damm boulevard feels like being at the centre of the world. Suddenly, people from East and West start to dance, free and elated, to the loud music blasting from Joes Bierhaus (since 2011 the Alt Berliner Biersalon). Even those not yet able to collect their DM 100 ""welcome money"" can join in, paid for by friends or strangers in the surrounding bars and restaurants. From the sales staff in the KaDeWe department store to West Berlin students - many happily slip a DM 5 note to someone who needs it or buy them a little something, soon shared with others. On a day like this, no one is left out.

Between euphoria and disenchantment

The crowds of people shift and flow from one queue to the next. The Ku'damm shops quickly adapt to their new customers. Everywhere, improvised signs offer special actions and discount for people from East Germany - and closing times suddenly become very flexible. The day's fave raves turn out to be sweets, with records and clothes also high up the rankings. Everyone has their own experience with capitalism - from the first burger in a fast food chain to looking at erotic lingerie and sex toys in the Beate Uhse shop. And even those queuing for hours in vain at the bank can at least take a look around. Here and there, you also hear some critical voices. After all, the prices leave no doubts - the GDR currency is too weak for people from East Germany to fulfil their big dreams.

"Bülowstraße 7, 10783 Berlin",52.498665,13.35673,History,1,FALSE,Urban Nation,"The world's first museum for contemporary urban art is in Berlin. In this world of free spirits, admission is also free
",,,"The museum that shouldn’t exist
Some street artists are fiercely opposed to the Urban Nation Museum in Berlin, vowing to never set foot in it. For them, urban art belongs in the street, not in specially created exhibition spaces. Are they missing out? Yes - on what is perhaps the capital's coolest and most unusual art gallery.

Even as you walk up to the museum's entrance, you can tell it's not like a normal art gallery. As you approach Urban Nation you encounter your first pieces of art on the walls of Bülowstraße in Berlin's Schöneberg district. Then you find yourself in front of the massive, distinctive facade of the museum itself.  

A museum without a museum director   

It's just as unusual when you step inside. Admission is free (always and for everyone). The museum floor is asphalted like the city streets that normally provide the setting for tape art, street art and graffiti. And you are actively encouraged to take photos. Yasha Young is not the Museum Director but, in true advertising agency style, introduces herself on the website as Executive Creative Director.  

""The museum is an information hub that is truly one of a kind"". This is how she describes her selection of contemporary urban art. Young has spent many years in New York and now her focus is on ""conducting a public conversation"". 

The museum aims to exhibit, explain, preserve and classify graffiti and street art so that it can shake off its reputation for being mere vandalism. Alongside the exhibition, Young is achieving this through projects with students, young artists, the neighbouring church and a local care home.  

But above all, Urban Nation wants to astonish its visitors. This begins with the elaborately remodelled Wilhelminian-style building in Schöneberg. Architect Thomas Willemeit has created rooms with ""insanely high ceilings"", perfect for such large-format works of art. Bridges have been suspended so that you can walk diagonally across the rooms and get up close to the artworks. This exciting ""parkour"" provides all kinds of different perspectives.  

Massive, changing images on the building's facade  

But the piece de resistance of Willemeit and his team is the museum's modular, interchangeable facade. At regular intervals, street artists transform the whole facade into a gigantic mural. These huge works are later dismantled and stored in the archives. Inside, there is room for some 150 works. Most of the exhibits are by the greats of the street art scene, but up-and-coming artists are also commissioned to create works specially for Urban Nation.  

It is no surprise that the first official Museum for Urban Contemporary Art should open its doors in Berlin. The former ""anti-fascist barrier"" is world famous as a work of graffiti art, and the city has a long tradition of decorating facades and firewalls in the many gaps between its buildings.  

With an ironic nod to the fact that the street is the natural environment of urban art, Young's museum calls itself the museum that shouldn't exist. 
","For more information, please go to https://www.visitberlin.de/en/urban-nation-museum-urban-contemporary-art","So far, no-one has crept out with a spray can under cover of darkness and painted over the changing face of Urban Nation's facade. Should this ever happen, the artist can decide whether to repair or welcome the creative interference in their work - then it automatically becomes part of the piece.

"Großer Stern, 10557 Berlin",52.51445,13.35008,History,1,FALSE,Victory Column,"Commissioned by Wilhelm I, King of Prussia - unveiled by Wilhelm I, Emperor of Germany
",,,"Three victories, one nation state
Fireworks exploding and the smell of acrid, black powder. Snorting horses, beating drums, and marching soldiers. All part of a magnificent military parade to celebrate the greatness of Prussia and the German Empire.

2 September 1873 - the third anniversary of the decisive Battle of Sedan in the Franco-Prussian War. In Berlin, a day to remember - not only to commemorate winning the war, but also its part in founding the German Empire. Today, in the presence of Emperor Wilhelm I, the Victory Column is ceremonially unveiled - a memorial he commissioned in 1864 as the then King of Prussia.

Celebrations at a different site

To be present at this unveiling of the Victory Column in 1873, you'd have to be just over 1.5 km away to the north east. When first built, the column stood on Königsplatz square, a former army exercise ground, today's Platz der Republik. On Königsplatz square, the monument, nearly 60 meters high, is framed by the Kroll Opera House and Count Raczyński's luxurious town mansion - a few years later, the site of the Reichstag Parliament building.

Originally, the column's crowning statue of the goddess of victory, a symbol of Prussia's striving for power, has a view across the later Siegesallee, a broad boulevard linking Königsplatz, close to the Reichstag, and Kemperplatz, near Potsdamer Platz. The column's then three blocks of sandstone are decorated with gilded canon barrels captured as war booty. Just like the base with its bronze reliefs and the mosaic frieze in the columned entrance, they recall the three Wars of German Unification. Between 1864 and 1871, Prussian forces are victorious in the Danish-Prussian War, the Austro-Prussian War and the Franco-Prussian War - successes resulting in Wilhelm I, King of Prussia, being proclaimed German Emperor in 1871 in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles.

Where the crème de la crème meets

The new Victory Column's unveiling ceremony offers a perfect insight into Prussian court etiquette, which follows a military hierarchy. Dressed in his full regalia and on horseback, Prince Otto von Bismarck, the Iron Chancellor, gives the command to unveil the monument. Meanwhile, the official guests are gathered in three separate groups. First, the imperial and royal court in a festive pavilion facing the Victory Column; then, on their own dedicated stand, the army generals and the rulers of the principalities and states who fought alongside Prussia in the Wars of German Unification. Finally, at a suitable distance, representatives of the Reichstag and the city of Berlin - including the liberal mayor of the city. The common people are free to celebrate the new Victory Column as they wish at another location in the evening.

After the third anniversary of the Battle of Sedan, the Victory Column stands on the same site for another 65 years - until the Nazi regime decrees that the memorial is in the way of their planned world capital Germania. In 1938, Albert Speer, Hitler's main architect, has the column moved to where you can now look up and see the golden goddess of victory.

Each ruler is framed by two portrait busts of his most important advisors. The locals are not so impressed, nicknaming it ""Puppet Avenue"".

",,,"When freedom tastes of candy bars
The Candy Bombers are coming! For the first time since the end of the war, here where you are now standing, airplane engines again roar over the heads of people in Berlin.

Just three years earlier, bombs were raining down from the skies. But this time the Allies are transporting a different, a valuable load - urgently needed relief supplies for a beleaguered city. 

On 24 June 1948, Stalin orders power to be cut off to the western sectors of Berlin. Just a little later, the road, rail and water routes to the divided city are blocked. People in the streets are just as alarmed as the western Allies. This is more than Soviet sabre-rattling. This is a threat to freedom, striking at the heart of over 2,200,000 people trapped in the city. Within just a few hours, confidence has turned to fear - how long can we survive like this?  

Will we fall into the hands of the Russians?  

Not if American Military Governor General L. D. Clay has anything to do with it! He isn't planning a military counterstrike, but a remarkable logistical feat - an airlift using all available Allied military planes from across the world. Under the Nazis, Tempelhof Airport was a place of forced labourers and armaments production, an architectural symbol of the regime's claim to power. Now, it quickly develops into a place of hope. Clay's ""Operation Vittles"" achieves the seemingly impossible - forging allies from victors and the defeated, fighting side by side to save Berlin. 

Turning enemies into friends  

Every day, 1500 tons of food are flown in to West Berlin. At the busiest times, planes land and take off every three minutes, not only bringing tinned goods, coal, and so on, but also a belief in the goodness of humanity. Thousands of the pilots also pack in candy bars and chewing gum tied into bundles on tiny parachutes. As they approach the runway, they throw the little bundles out of the cockpit window. As they sail down to the ground, these sweet gifts capture the hearts of the waiting children. In total, the airlift flies in nearly one and a half million tons of coal, and almost half a million tons of food. 

On the night of 12 May 1949, after 322 days, the Soviets finally lift the blockade - West Berlin is saved. 

On the trail of the Candy Bomber 

Today, the Airlift Memorial commemorates Berlin's friendship with the Allies and the 79 people who lost their lives in the course of the operation. If you stand with your back to the airport building's former main entrance, you can't miss the memorial, twenty metres high and made of reinforced concrete. For the locals, the memorial also has a nickname, ironically dubbed the ""Hungerharke"" (literally ""hunger rake""). The three struts pointing west symbolise the three air corridors open to the planes. Originally, architect Eduard Ludwig plans an installation in light alloy, but it does not meet the building regulations. He also wants it to be a unique piece, but there too he will be disappointed. His second design is accepted and built - followed by a replica in Frankfurt am Main in 1985 and a third memorial in 1988 in Celle, both locations where Candy Bombers once took off for Berlin. 

Probably the most impressive testament to the airlift is a real Candy Bomber, a Douglas C-47 B Skytrain, set on the roof of the newly constructed terrace of the German Museum of Technology not far from Potsdamer Platz.

",,,"A policeman stands up for his beliefs
Dense smoke belches from the anteroom of the New Synagogue on Oranienburger Straße. Torah scrolls fly out the door. Window panes shatter, chandeliers lie on the floor in smithereens. It's the night of November 9th. Jewish places of worship are being set alight all over Berlin, and the New Synagogue is no exception. Germany's largest synagogue is in flames, but the head of the local police is not prepared to stand by while the brownshirts burn it to the ground. He draws his pistol.

The New Synagogue is the embodiment of Jewish life in Berlin. With its gleaming golden dome, its Moorish architecture is reminiscent the Thousand And One Nights. It is destined to be one of the Nazis' main targets on the night of 9 November 1938. 

Ordnung muss sein - Order must prevail! 

Wilhelm Krützfeld, the head of the local police precinct, confronts the brownshirts. In one hand he clutches his pistol. In the other he holds an even more powerful weapon - a document from the imperial era showing that the monument is a protected historical landmark. Krützfeld calls the fire brigade and ensures they can access the building. He throws out the rioters and arsonists, and the SA mob is forced to disperse. On this night of terror that is later dubbed Kristallnacht (Night of Broken Glass), the New Synagogue is one of the few synagogues in the whole of Germany to sustain only minimal damage.  

The brownshirts didn't reckon with someone like Krützfeld. On that fateful night, he is one of the few people who is prepared to stand up to them. The police officer is determined to maintain public order. As a Prussian official, he is conscientious with a sense of justice. But this means he is at odds with his nation's Nazi rulers. The next day, Berlin's police commissioner calls Krützfeld into his office, but allows him to return to work with a verbal reprimand. 

Correctness becomes courage 

This is not the only time that Krützfeld and his colleagues take a moral stand. Krützfeld stamps forged identity cards and warns Jewish residents in his neighbourhood when raids are imminent. The police lieutenant retires in 1943 and returns to his native Schleswig-Holstein. 

He is memorialised in Heinz Knobloch Krützfeld's book Der beherzte Reviervorsteher (The Valiant Precinct Chief). To the right of the synagogue entrance you can see a plaque commemorating Wilhelm Krützfeld. It was donated by the Berlin police.

"Prinzenstraße 35/38, 10969 Berlin",52.50269973,13.4102088,History,1,FALSE,Wertheim Department Store,"The Wertheim brothers set new standards in shopping. In 1927, their department store on Leipziger Platz was ranked as the largest in Europe.
",,,"Department store with a private tunnel to the tube station
In 1928, the Wertheim chain of department stores convinces the city of Berlin to change the route of its newly-planned U8 tube line. For a payment of 5 million Reichsmark (around &euro;20 million today), the department store is given a private pedestrian tunnel to the tube station at Moritzplatz. Here, Wertheim follows the example of the Karstadt department store at Berlin's Hermannplatz where the advantage of direct access to the tube platform attracts growing numbers of shoppers.

The Wertheim department store's paramount principle is free entry without the psychological pressure to buy. In an approach just as innovative, it offers a broad range of products all on display with fixed prices payable only in cash. As if that wasn't enough, the store also offers customers a right to return or exchange goods - and, as the cherry on the cake, holds irresistible end-of-season sales.

In Wertheim, buying is designed to be a delight and a pleasure. Industrial magnate (later German foreign minister) Gustav Stresemann notes that ""civil servants' wives from the west of the city surrender themselves to this hustle and bustle just as willingly as workers' wives from eastern Berlin, always wearing their good dress [... when they go to Wertheim].""

The story of the Wertheim family of entrepreneurs begins in Stralsund, on the Baltic coast. In 1885, they open their first small branch in Berlin. In 1893/94, they have their first real department store custom-built at Oranienstraße 53/54, designed by architect Alfred Messel. With the store's rapid rise to fame, the premises are soon too cramped for their growing selection of tempting goods. Wertheim has to leave, and the building then becomes Café Moritzplatz.

Wertheim's new building, its second venue in Berlin, is directly on Moritzplatz and designed by Eugen Schmohl (1880-1926) in the new modernist style. The new department store stretches from Prinzenstraße to Oranienstraße with a floor space of 4,535 square metres. The architecture and layout reflects the Wertheim brothers' vision - as much sales space as possible with the customers' route through the store as pleasant as possible. The design, height and furnishings not only provide the requisite light and air, but are also informed by the styles in display architecture at that time.

In 1934, a year after the Nazi Party's seizure of power, the Wertheim company is forced to adopt the Nazi policy of ""Aryanisation"". To avoid the worst, Georg Wertheim hands over his entire assets to his wife Ursula, who was not classified as a Jew under the Nazi racial laws. Nonetheless, in 1935 the Nazis still categorise the Wertheim company as ""purely Jewish"". Two years later the shareholders are expropriated, and the important and highly successful Wertheim group renamed the AWAG (Allgemeine Warenhaus AG).

The Wertheim building was badly damaged in air raids during the Second World War. Until finally demolished in the early 1950s, the burnt-out shell of the building could still be seen on the corner plot of Moritzplatz.

The Wertheim name managed to survive the war. In wartime advertising, the name is only mentioned as an afterthought - ""AWAG formerly Wertheim"". But after the war, a new department store is opened on Schloßstraße in Steglitz. As early as 1952, it bears the store's traditional name - Wertheim.

 

 
",,"Since 2009, this Moritzplatz site of the former Wertheim department store has been home to the Princess Gardens urban gardening project. On the former waste land between Prinzenstraße and Oranienstraße, an enthusiastic group of volunteers have set up an urban communal mobile garden on an area of around 5800 square metres - roughly the size of a football pitch. Unfortunately, the project is facing an uncertain future.

",,,"“A breeding ground for talent” (1)
Journalist Egon Erwin Kisch and art dealer Alfred Flechtheim meet at the Romanisches Café. On the marble table in front of Kisch is a copy of Karl Marx's Das Kapital. With a grin, Flechtheim says: ""Finally, someone who can explain the difference between capital and work!"" That's easy, says Kisch. ""If you lend me a thousand marks now, I have capital. The effort you have to make to get your money back is work."" 

A place for networking 

In the Twenties, the Romanisches Café is a magnet for artists. The café can tell many stories about its free-spirited guests - and their chronic financial problems. But the coffee house is not exactly attractive. Its ambience is reminiscent of a station concourse, the food is bad, the floor is filthy and the air smoky. There's also a strict hierarchy. A distinction is made between the Schwimmerbassin (swimmers' pool), which is frequented by the regulars, and the Nichtschwimmerbecken (non-swimmers' pool), where strangers are allowed to sit.  

But people are attracted by the fact that they can sit for hours over a single cup of coffee. It's a place for making contacts and building networks, drawing in established artists and aspiring hopefuls. It's a breeding ground for new projects, exciting new ideas and artistic inspiration. 

A celebrity hang-out  

The cafe has a long list of famous patrons. Artists flock to sit with Impressionist painter Max Slevogt, whose table is occasionally graced by the presence of Max Liebermann. Journalists and critics meet up here, though the influential critic Alfred Kerr rarely shows up because his reviews have usually upset one or other of the regulars. It's a regular haunt of actress Carola Neher and her husband, the poet known as Klabund. Gabriele Tergit describes the cafe in her novel Käsebier erobert den Kurfürstendamm. Director and screenwriter Robert Siodmak recalls how the cafe sparked the idea for his film Menschen am Sonntag.  

For some guests, the coffee house is a way of life. Bohemian artist John Höxter is part of the furniture, spending his days scrounging from table to table. The Romanisches Cafe inspires many of its guests, and its regulars extol it in books, poems and songs, including a revue by the famous composer Friedrich Hollaender. 

The spot where swimmers and non-swimmers vied for attention back in the Twenties is now the site of the World Fountain on Breitscheidplatz.

",,,"Gardening for all at Tempelhofer Feld
Members of the Allmende Kontor community garden have organised a big picnic. A new face shows up, and she's clearly enjoying eating and drinking with the other gardeners. She then makes an emotional confession to the organisers - she's lived in the neighbourhood for 40 years, but this is the most contact she's ever had with other locals. 

It's stories like this that highlight the true spirit of the community garden at Tempelhofer Feld. It's not just about growing flowers and vegetables. ""The main thing is its multicultural aspect""  ,explains garden activist Elisabeth Meyer-Renschhausen. It is particularly important for families, migrants and senior citizens to have access to multi-purpose public spaces close to their homes. They provide opportunities to chat to other people, learn from each other and help each other. Such spaces also help refugees to play an active, meaningful role in their new home.   

Build it and they will come   

In 2011, 13 keen gardeners start using a small part of the 380-hectare open space at the former airport. The project quickly takes off and people are keen to join in. Tourists and journalists turn up to see what's going on. The waiting list starts to grow. Elisabeth Meyer-Renschhausen has little time for gardening these days because she has so many questions to answer. The Allmende Kontor has certainly helped to fuel the urban gardening trend in Berlin. 

When you visit, it's easy to see why. Berlin's best-known community garden is packed with fascinating features. There are bee-keeping and composting groups, workshops on organic pest control and occasional, unplanned lectures. ""Turkish women come along to grow their vegetables, and they're appalled when they realise that today's youngsters haven't a clue. They feel compelled to show them how to do it."", says Kontor member Severin Halder. 

Unplanned lectures   

The focus of the Allmende founders has always been on sowing the seeds of inspiration. They are keen to arouse people's curiosity and motivate them to start a ""real"" garden of their own somewhere in the city.  

""I think what visitors love most is the space, the freedom"" says another activist. Let your gaze wander across the vast expanse of the Tempelhofer Feld recreation area and you'll understand why. No other major city has such an incredible panorama right at its heart.  

Then there's the attractive, alternative atmosphere of the Kontor garden. Raised beds made with scraps of wood, lots of bright colours, just about everything has been improvised. The garden has a certain drop-out charm, but it looks like it's here to stay - the owner has regularly extended the lease since 2011.
",,"Everything in the Allmende-Kontor garden is grown in raised beds. Permanent plots are not allowed on the Tempelhofer Feld because the authorities are worried about unexploded World War II bombs and soil pollution. But the gardeners believe this is just an excuse to make sure their garden remains ""mobile"". It makes it easier to move them on if there are ever plans to develop the site.

",,,"A squat comes alive
Renovated period building with hardwood floors and large terrace overlooking inner courtyard. This is how 68 Rosenthaler Straße was recently described in an estate agent's advert - a far cry from how the building looked in 1990. At that time it was surrounded by rubble with empty lots on either side. Yet the place was alive and kicking as the bass-heavy beats of a punk band boomed out into the street.

The GDR is not a good place to be a punk. Pogoing and mohicans don't exactly fit in with the political system. But when the Wall comes down, everything changes. New spaces are suddenly opening up because so many buildings have been abandoned. 68 Rosenthaler Straße is just one of many forgotten properties in East Berlin. On 17 January 1990 the first squatters move into the dilapidated building. The cellar ceiling seems to be on the verge of collapse, so the squatters simply rip it out. This involves shifting bucket after bucket of rubble - which is how the building gets its new name: the Eimer, the German word for bucket.  

The building soon fills up. More and more squatters are discovering that East Berlin is largely operating outside of the law. West Berlin's police don't feel they are responsible, and East Germany's Volkspolizei no longer feel an incentive to get their fingers burned. This power vacuum provides a hotbed for East Berlin's punk movement, and artists also start moving in from the West.  

Alternative versus mainstream  

The basement with its open cellar soon becomes a leading underground club. It attracts two types of people - those who are looking for somewhere to try out new ideas, and those who have ideas for making money out of them. East Berlin bands like Freygang, DieFirma, Ich-Funktion and Teutonic Death Fun Core and legendary punks such as Speiche play here and declare war on commercialism. Cigarette machines? Forget it. Slot machines? Rip-off. Here you get alternative music and beer for next to nothing.  

Politics and pogoing are poor bedfellows  

The Eimer manages to remain generally apolitical, despite the fact that the squatter scene is very left-wing. ""Freedom is more than being left-wing"" says one of the first squatters to move in. That's what the Eimer is all about - freedom from the mainstream, freedom from convention, being open to new things. When the occupants discover that two members of the band Freygang were once Stasi informants, they are immediately banished from the building. You don't mess with the Eimer.

",,,"Taking liberties at the border crossing
The East German border guards understand how to instil fear. They know every psychological trick in the book when it comes to harassing people, making them feel helpless, stoking their fear. But the West Berliners dare to take a few liberties.

It's a hot summer's day in the mid-1980s. At the Dreilinden-Drewitz border crossing, known as Checkpoint Bravo to the Western Allies, traffic is backing up as it waits to transit the GDR. Although it's forbidden, people switch off their engines, get out of their stuffy cars and stretch their legs on the motorway. 

They chat and kill time while the GDR's border guards carry out their stringent checks on the people in front. As the queue inches forwards, the drivers simply push their cars a couple of metres. At least they're protecting the environment! At communist Germany's border with the West, the atmosphere is as threatening as ever. But after more than 20 years, the West Berliners are used to it.  

It's hard to imagine now, but every resident of West Berlin who wanted to go on holiday, visit another part of West Germany or enter East Germany had to endure these interminable procedures. The transit route on what is now the A115 leads to Hanover and on to Germany's south west. Dreilinden-Drewitz is the bottleneck through which people reach freedom.  

Same route, same rituals  

Travelling from West to East, you pass the lines of hitchhikers at the Dreilinden service station and head directly beneath the West's control bridge. A few metres further on you come to another bridge. This is where you see the divided city's most famous warning, painted in white letters spanning the motorway: ""You are leaving the American Sector"". You have to slow down to 40 kph as you pass the Soviet tank monument and approach the dreaded GDR checkpoint at Drewitz. Journalist Sven Felix Kellerhoff remembers the buzz he used to feel. His father would tell him and his brother not to whinge, wriggle or crack jokes while the GDR's border guards were at work. 

Today, little remains of this formidable checkpoint, though you can visit the old command tower if you stop in Kleinmachnow. Back then, the procedures were the same at every checkpoint. 

First the occupants of the car have to hand over their passports and vehicle documents, which are transported to the actual checkpoint via a conveyor belt. You're left sitting in your car without a passport - in no man's land everyone has to feel like a nobody. You just sit there while the civilian staff, customs officers and border police all check your papers. It might take 20 minutes, or an hour, or even five hours if relations between the two Germanys have worsened. If you want to enter or leave the GDR you simply have to put up with it. If you're just transiting, you'll be dealt with relatively quickly. Once the barrier has been lifted, you embark on a monotonous journey down a hermetically sealed road until you reach the free part of Germany at the next border crossing.

",,,"Escaping to the East
On this exact spot, just after 5am, 196 people fled over the Wall to East Berlin. This was in response to the aggressive evictions being carried out by West Berlin's police. They gained jurisdiction of this area of no man's land at midnight and immediately began clearing out the squatters.

Ever since the squatters moved in, the Lenné Triangle has become an untouchable corner of no man's land. Although it lies to the west of the Wall, the triangle between Lennéstraße, Bellevuestraße and Ebertstraße actually belongs to the Soviet sector. But when the Wall is built, it is decided to keep it in a straight line so that the border guards have a clear view. It's off-limits to the West Berlin police, and the East Berlin authorities have little interest in this scrap of land. 

Welcome to the Free Republic of Kubat 

This all changes on 26 May 1988, when it provides a stage for some extraordinary developments. The protagonists include eco-warriors seeking to protect the environment, squatters who have discovered a new space, and curious onlookers. The audience is the GDR border guards, who look on in disbelief. And it's quite a show. The occupiers build shacks, move in their pets, set up a communal kitchen. Music blares across the encampment. 

Norbert Kubat is unaware of all this. After being arrested for breach of the peace by plain-clothes policemen in Kreuzberg, he commits suicide in custody on 26 May. His death makes him a martyr for everyone who is fighting for freedom in the face of state oppression. His name becomes a symbol of resistance and the Lenné Triangle encampment is dubbed the Free Republic of Kubat.   

Police clampdown on Checkpoint Norbi 

On 1 July, jurisdiction over the Lenné Triangle is passed to West Berlin. At 5am, the police storm the area known as Checkpoint Norbi. Anyone caught sleeping is arrested. But 196 protesters have other plans. They use a ladder to scale the Wall, where they are awaited by the East German authorities. This is a major PR coup for the GDR regime. They give the escapees breakfast and provide a shuttle service to the nearest border crossing, even throwing in a free train ticket. The first Berliners to flee en masse to the East are back in the West.

The guitar riff rings out, the drums join in - followed by the voice of David Bowie. He is composing one of his greatest songs. We can be heroes, just for one day - words full of hope in the midst of the Cold War. It's 1977, and West Berlin is a magnet for artists from all over the world. Hansa Studios is the place to be for musicians like Iggy Pop, Bowie and Depeche Mode.

The Meisel brothers bought the dilapidated building on Köthener Strasse in 1976 to convert it into recording studios. It still bears the number 38, which is a little superfluous, as only two buildings on the street have survived the war. Hansa Studios is surrounded by no-man's-land - and the Wall.  

Inspiration in the shadow of the Wall  

The international artists are both fascinated and bewildered when they see the border between the two Germanys. The Wall leaves no one cold - except the border guards, who stoically endure their class enemy's music as it drifts through the open windows. In the 1970s, a trip on the S-Bahn through empty ghost stations inspires Iggy Pop to write his song Passenger. The musicians have not only fallen for the run-down charms of this divided city, but they also love the mix of old school and high tech on offer at Hansa Studios. At its heart is the Meistersaal, a huge room with a wood-panelled ceiling, parquet floors and unique acoustics. Bowie is bowled over the moment he sets foot in it, exclaiming: ""A big hall by the Wall!"". 

From Heroes to Achtung Baby!  

In the 1980s, a local band called the Einstürzende Neubauten transforms the hall into an experimental cellar with instruments made from old shopping trolleys and bits of scrap metal. One day Martin Gore of Depeche Mode can be found sitting naked at the piano in the Meistersaal composing Somebody. This is where U2 reunite after tensions in the band to record their album Achtung Baby! Between 1976 and 1990 it feels like anything is possible in West Berlin. We can still hear this sense of freedom in the songs of that time: ""We can be heroes, just for one day.""

",,,"A pub crawl in the name of the Lord
One winter evening in 1925, theology student Hans Rückert sets out on a secret mission. Joined by a fellow student, his task is to travel deep into Friedrichshain, the working-class district in the east of Berlin. On behalf of their professor, the two students, dressed as workers, explore pubs and taverns along Fruchtstraße - today's Straße der Pariser Kommune.

In those days, the area has a very dubious reputation. Solidly working class, apartment blocks are set around dark courtyards, and innumerable pubs and taverns line the street. The professor and his students hope to wean the workers from alcohol, and inspire them to practice the Christian faith. First, though, they need an undercover look at the neighbourhood's licentious amusements.  

A walk along the entertainment district 

Just under one kilometre long, the street has 32 pubs. On one evening, in the space of six hours, Hans Rückert and his friend visit over half of them. They count nearly 300 people drinking there, mostly men escaping the cramped conditions at home. But they also meet cases for concern - young men in various states of drunkenness, some totally wasted.  

In the Eldorado-Diele pub, the students can hardly believe their eyes. As the red light at the entrance clearly indicates, this is a pub with hostesses. They watch two hostesses encouraging guests to have one drink after another. Pushy and persistent, the women beg cigarettes and drinks - and one guest actually lets them wheedle him out of the incredible sum of 90 Reichsmark. In Berlin, as a hotbed of vice, unlimited freedom also leaves you free to follow the path to ruin. As far as we know, the two students' visit to this twilight world had no further consequences - but unfortunately, no records exist on the outcome of their expedition.  

Extraordinary entertainment for ordinary folk 

The pubs are not the only nightlife venues in this working-class neighbourhood. Exactly on this site, where today you can see the Neues Deutschland publishing house, the Plaza variety theatre opens 1 February 1929. In a former station building converted into a vast theatre, the Plaza is under the same management as Schöneberg's renowned Scala variety theatre. The free-standing balcony with 820 seats is a sensation. The Plaza can seat a total of 3000 people to experience, as the theatre programme promises, ""the biggest line-up of the highest artistry at the lowest prices"".

In the Plaza, such stars as popular entertainer and singer Claire Waldoff plays to huge audiences. In the meantime, the working class in Friedrichshain has more leisure and a little more money and can afford such pleasures. But in autumn 1929, the financial world is shaken to its roots. On Black Friday, Berlin is also sucked into the maelstrom of the global economic crisis. The Plaza is forced to close temporarily, and reopens as an operetta theatre. The Nazi regime dispossesses the Jewish owners, and later turns the theatre into a venue for their own Kraft durch Freude (Strength through Joy) leisure organisation. Now, the amusements in the neighbourhood are directed to war preparations.

",,,"A bitter housing shortage has a sweet solution
Chocolate? It's a long time since the former Zar Chocolate factory smelt of chocolate. Nowadays it's the sweet smell of freedom that wafts through the building, which has been occupied by squatters since 1990. The old building is also proof that perseverance pays off.

By the time 20 young people move into the former factory complex, the building has already had a chequered history. It's been a stonemason's workshop, a chocolate factory, a Hitler Youth base, a horse stables, a commodities warehouse and finally a derelict building. Toilets and bathrooms? Nope. Heating that works? Not really.  

Summer of anarchy  

The building might be crumbling, but it still seems like a good place to set up a squat. After all, it's the brief summer of anarchy. Everything is up for grabs because the authorities and East Germany's Volkspolizei are no longer bothered about squats, and West Berlin's police and politicians will only take over responsibility once the Unification Treaty has been signed. It's still East Berlin, but the power vacuum means freedom is breaking out.

The empty properties also exercise their charm on West Berliners and soon a diverse mix of people are bringing the former chocolate factory back to life. Artists flock there to open studios and workshops, theatres and clubs. The Schoko-Laden quickly becomes the first alternative cultural centre. It's a place where people can live and work together far removed from the day-to-day reality of exploitation and political borders.  

Cooperation is the key  

The squatters are keen to find a way to make their centre work. They set up a culture and housing association known as Schokoladen e.V. While some shared housing projects are forcibly shut down, the Schokoladen has better luck. Its residents manage to convert the squat into legal tenancies, while still retaining a degree of self-determination. Later on, they successfully fend off attempts to evict them. The unique atmosphere of this non-commercial microcosm provides a rich breeding ground for unusual ideas. There's room for everything and everyone, from cello punk to the Club of Polish Losers.

",,,"An underground gateway to the world
Its construction caused a sensation. Right here beneath your feet, the Excelsior tunnel was opened on 15 March 1928. It connected the city's biggest railway station with the continent's biggest hotel. So it's hardly surprising that the Hotel Excelsior dubbed the 80-metre-long tunnel from the station to its door ""the longest hotel tunnel in the world"". It's all about the power of superlatives.

From waiter to hotel manager 

It was Curt Elschner who came up with the idea of the tunnel. He had worked his way up from lowly waiter to famous hotel manager. He bought the Hotel Excelsior in 1919. Today, a supermarket stands where its entrance used to be. Elschner decides to focus on attracting the masses rather than the upper classes. He gradually expands the hotel until it has 600 rooms and 750 beds.  

The hotel's main draw is its proximity to Anhalter railway station across the road. Every day, 14,000 long-distance travellers pass through the station. He has the tunnel built so that it is even easier for guests to get to the hotel from the station. Gold-plated elevators whisk guests into the tunnel from the station concourse and hotel lobby. Elschner invested one million Reichsmarks of his own money in the project - a huge sum at the time. He also has to pay 10,000 Reichsmarks to the Reichsbahn, which operates the station.  

A gateway to the world 

The tunnel is first and foremost a publicity stunt. It receives extensive coverage in the Berlin dailies. The Vossische Zeitung points out that there is a ticket office at the entrance to the tunnel. This means hotel guests can buy their train tickets without having to set foot on Berlin's crowded streets. Then they can not only travel to the Free State of Anhalt, but also to Paris or Naples, as 120 long-distance trains pass through the station every day Its three sweeping arches provide a gateway to the world.  

But the tunnel is an economic disaster, as only 100 people use the underpass each day. The shops in the tunnel are operated by KaDeWe, but they prove difficult to let. Elschner fights for a discount, writing to the Reichsbahn: ""Unfortunately, the tunnel itself can be described as a failure as its use is virtually non-existent.""   

Anhalter station is damaged during the war and comes to a complete standstill after 1945. It is eventually demolished, apart from the central portion of its facade. Allied bombers also reduce the Hotel Excelsior to a burning ruin. It is finally replaced by a 17-storey tower block, the Excelsiorhaus, which has nothing to do with the hotel apart from its name. The tunnel fades into oblivion until it is uncovered during construction works on Stresemannstraße in 1985. It is filled in and, with that, the last vestige of Twenties glamour disappears at Anhalter station.

",,,"The city of tomorrow
In 1957, the West Berlin Senate decides to create a new landmark in the Tiergarten area that will be visible the eastern part of the city. The result is the building you see in front of you. Because of its height and colour, this high-rise building in the Hansaviertel district is known as the Giraffe. It is 53 metres high and has 164 studio apartments over 17 floors.

The International Building Exhibition (INTERBAU) in 1957 proves to be a stroke of luck for architects Klaus Müller-Rehm and Gerhard Siegmann. Not only do they get to work with other top international architects on the designs for a whole new quarter, but they are also picked to draw up the plans for its tallest building.  

From rubble to modernist minimalism 

The original plan is for a single high-rise building to be built on a vast expanse of rubble. West Berlin Senate's Building Director Ludwig Lemmer thinks the project is too big for Müller-Rehm to handle on his own, so he brings in Gerhard Siegmann. The latter is also an advocate of minimalism and is experienced in making the most of scarce building materials. They make a strong team, but the Giraffe project still has its share of challenges. Money problems mean the completion date is pushed back several times.  

A response to Moscow-style socialist boulevards 

West Berlin's Senate is determined that the prestigious INTERBAU project must not fail. It has to be a response to the ""wedding-cake"" socialist architecture of Karl-Marx-Allee on the other side of the Wall. The GDR regime commissioned architect Hermann Henselmann to build ""workers' palaces"" on the first socialist boulevard. Now it is the turn of top architects such as Alvar Aalto, Walter Gropius, Oscar Niemeyer, Pierre Vago, Luciano Baldessari, Max Taut and Le Corbusier to give West Berlin its own new architectural apparel. While Le Corbusier's planned building has to be moved closer to the Olympic Stadium, the other architects get to realise their visions in the Hansaviertel. But not without compromises. Building regulations take their toll. Indeed, they cause so many problems that most of the international architects take down their nameplates.

Fortunately, the tower block is spared these problems. It earns the nickname Giraffe because of its colour and the restaurant of the same name on the ground floor. It is the first building to go up in the Hansaviertel.

",,,"A bell rings out for freedom
Half a million Berliners are waiting excitedly for the bell to toll. On 24 October 1960, a huge crowd has gathered at Schöneberg Town Hall, the former city hall of West Berlin. They are joined by Konrad Adenauer and US General Lucius D. Clay, who is about to make the replica of the famous Liberty Bell chime for the very first time. At 12 noon precisely, General Clay throws the switch. Everyone looks up in anticipation - but nothing happens.

A gift from the USA 

The Freedom Bell has made a long journey to get here. In early 1950, Lucius D. Clay - known as the ""Father of the Berlin Airlift"" - makes a proposal to the new National Committee for a Free Europe. He suggests making a replica of the famous Liberty Bell so that West Berlin has its own symbol of freedom.  

16 million Americans donate money so that the bell can be cast and sign the following declaration of freedom: ""I believe in the sacredness and dignity of the individual. / I believe that all men derive the right to freedom equally from God. / I pledge to resist aggression and tyranny wherever they appear on earth."" 

The bell cast in London is called the Freedom Bell. It acts as a reminder of all the people who are unable to live their lives in freedom. Clay initiates a Crusade for Freedom - the ten-tonne bronze bell travels right across the USA before reaching its final destination at Schöneberg Town Hall on 21 October 1950.   

When you stand on Rathausplatz, where John F. Kennedy spoke those famous words ""Ich bin ein Berliner"" in 1963, it's hard to grasp the true scale of the Freedom Bell. High up in the 70-metre bell tower, it weighs 10,206 kilograms and measures 2.6 metres across.  

From the Town Hall tower to the world  

General Lucius D. Clay must have had quite a shock when the bell didn't ring - but fortunately this hasn't been repeated. Right on cue, the Freedom Bell rings out for two minutes at 12 noon every day. It also chimes at midnight on 1 May, Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve, and marks major political events, such as the reunification of Germany on 3 October 1990. Two days after the 9/11 attacks, the bell tolled for 7 minutes in memory of the victims.  

So what was the problem on 24 October 1950? It was nothing serious - when General Clay threw the switch, he blew the fuses in the improvised electrical system. Fortunately, some workers up in the bell tower started physically pushing the bell - and the Freedom Bell began to chime.  

Its premiere was broadcast by 2,000 radio stations around the world. From then on, the bells and the declaration of freedom were broadcast at noon every Sunday on RIAS radio, a station set up by the US military administration in West Berlin. 

Today, the Freedom Bell is the biggest non-church bell in Berlin. When it rings out at noon every day, it reminds us of something very precious: our freedom.

",,,"SA terror on Berlin's famous boulevard
It's 12 September 1931, a Saturday evening. Outside Café Reimann, people are sipping coffee and enjoying one of the last warm days of summer. But a peaceful evening on the Kurfürstendamm turns into a dreadful night of violence and terror.

Around 9 o'clock they hear shouts coming from nearby Fasanenstraße: ""Juda verrecke, Deutschland erwache!"" (""Perish Judah, Germany awaken!"") Groups of young men appear, all dressed in brown shirts. They are members of the Sturmabteilung (SA), the Nazi's paramilitary wing, which has been terrorising Berlin for years.  

Panic at Café Reimann 

The brownshirts pile into the cafe, smashing furniture, shattering windows, beating up the customers. Panic breaks out when an SA man takes out his revolver and fires two bullets into the ceiling. Groups of brownshirts roam the Kurfürstendamm, on the look-out for anyone who looks vaguely Jewish, even laying into a German nationalist, the journalist Peter Derichsweiler.  Shopkeepers rush to lower their shutters, but the people on the street have no such protection against the attackers. 

Attack on Jewish New Year  

This is no spontaneous attack by the SA. By 7.30pm, around a thousand brownshirts have gathered at the Memorial Church. They head en masse to the synagogue on Fasanenstraße and hang around outside, waiting for the worshippers to emerge. Their choice of day is also not random - it's Rosh Hashana, Jewish New Year. But the SA men are too late, and the synagogue has already emptied. So they switch their attention to the Kurfürstendamm.  

Their attacks are highly organised. Two of the SA's leaders, Karl Ernst and Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorff, drive around in open-top cabs giving out orders. Behind the scenes, Goebbels has a clear strategy. The Ku'damm is too ""Jewish"" for his liking, so over the years he has been sending his men here to hand out leaflets and threaten Jews.  

The police are too late, the courts are too weak 

The police are nowhere to be seen. For nearly an hour, the SA are left to wreak havoc. And when the police finally turn up, their attempts to stop the violence are lukewarm at best. By eleven o'clock, the violence is continuing unabated on nearby Nollendorfplatz. 50 men are arrested, but only 22 remain in custody.  

The defendants are given short prison sentences, and these sentences are reduced still further on appeal in February 1932. Graf von Helldorff and Karl Ernst are actually acquitted, and Helldorff goes on to pursue his own career in the police force. In 1933, the Nazis appoint him police chief of Potsdam and Berlin.

Fanfares echo around Hardenbergstraße as the guests arrive for the gala performance. It's 23 October 1931 - the German premiere of the film Der Kongress tanzt at the Ufa-Palast am Zoo cinema. This musical comedy directed by Erik Charell is one of the very first films with sound. Production costs have run into the millions, and it features lavish costumes and sets. Thousands flock to the Berlin premiere, only to be disappointed when they are turned away.

The world premiere was held a few days earlier in Vienna - the film is, after all, about the Congress of Vienna - and it flopped. To prevent such a fiasco from happening again in Berlin, Ufa spends 30,000 Reichsmarks on advertising. The two leads, Lilian Harvey and Willy Fritsch, are also invited to appear at the gala performance. Ufa's strategy pays off and the glamorous premiere is a glittering success. 

Illuminated organs and air conditioning, neo-Romanesque and Baroque 

The Ufa-Palast am Zoo cinema stood on approximately the same site as the present Zoo Palast cinema, which opened in 1957. The exterior of the old Ufa-Palast was anything but modern. Forming part of the square that is sometimes called the ""Romanesque Forum"", it was built in a similar neo-Romanesque style to the Memorial Church. Behind the medieval-looking façade was an auditorium that could accommodate over 2,000 guests. The visual splendour was enhanced by a golden curtain and an illuminated organ, which projected coloured lights into the auditorium. 

The Ufa-Palast is the flagship premiere cinema owned by Universum Film AG, or Ufa for short. But it is not the only grand cinema in the vicinity. The Capitol cinema opened in 1925, right next to the Ufa-Palast, on the spot where the Bikinihaus building stands today. Hans Poelzig's new building had a simple, modern exterior and a colourful interior with air conditioning to ensure the comfort of cinemagoers. 

1926 saw the opening of another cinema, the Gloria-Palast. It was located next to the Memorial Church, on the site of the new Upper West skyscraper that opened in 2017. Like the Ufa-Palast, the exterior was neo-Romanesque, while the auditorium reminded the journalist Eugen Szatmari ""more of an intimate little court theatre of the Baroque era than a 1927 cinema"".  The premiere of The Blue Angel with Marlene Dietrich and Emil Jannings in the lead roles was held here in April 1930. 

Costume drama with catchy tunes 

The popularity of Der Kongress tanzt continued after its premiere and it became the most successful film of 1931.The story of the Russian Tsar who courts a glove saleswoman clearly appealed to filmgoers. The film was shot three times &not;- in German, English and French - because dubbing hadn't yet been invented. Lilian Harvey appears in all the different versions, whereas Willy Fritsch can only be seen in the German version, as he can't speak any other languages. The film is still remembered to this day, mainly because of the song Das gibt's nur einmal.
",,"Fritz Lang's Metropolis premieres at the Ufa-Palast am Zoo in 1927. Production takes over two years and expectations are high. Many celebrities turn up for the gala performance. Metropolis is aesthetically pleasing, but many people find the story too kitschy and the length of the film is somewhat challenging - the original version is more than two-and-a-half hours long.

",,,"The secret route to freedom
The morning of 10 February 1962 dawns cold and clear over Potsdam. At precisely 8.44am, a man steps onto the Glienicke Bridge. He walks slowly across the river Havel towards Berlin. He is the American pilot Francis Gary Powers - and when he reaches the halfway point, he knows he is finally free.

Six minutes later, KGB Colonel Rudolf Ivanovich Abel crosses the bridge in the opposite direction. The first exchange of spies on German soil between the United States and the Soviet Union has gone without a hitch. The exchange is top secret, but information still leaks out to the public. Glienicke Bridge in Berlin's south west hits the headlines and becomes famous around the world at the ""Bridge of Spies"". 

The perfect bridge for secret operations   

It's no coincidence that the US and USSR want to use this particular location for their top-secret exchanges. This steel construction first opened in 1907 as the Kaiser Wilhelm Bridge. Ironically, the GDR government later changes its name to the Bridge of Unity. It turns out to be the perfect place for conducting intelligence missions.  

Unlike the checkpoints in the city, traffic is light. In winter, the bridge disappears into the mist that hangs over the Havel. It's easy for representatives of the two superpowers to reach the bridge from Berlin and simple to monitor and secure the surroundings. So it's hardly surprising that, after the successful premiere, the Iron Curtain rises twice more to allow real or supposed agents to walk free.  

But we have to wait 20 years for the sequel. After years of intense negotiation, on the morning of 12 June 1985 the normally deserted bridge is a hive of activity. A bus is waiting on the Potsdam side of the bridge. It contains East Germans, Poles and an Austrian. Some of them have been in prison for years on suspicion of spying for the CIA. Limousines and minibuses approach the bridge from the West Berlin side. They are bringing four former spies from Warsaw Pact countries.  

23 US agents for 4 Soviet spies  

This exchange of prisoners has been mediated by Wolfgang Vogel, the GDR's famous negotiator. Once again he has done a good job: as the clock strikes noon, 23 US spies and 4 Soviet agents cross the border over the Havel. This time the agents are driven to the white border post in the middle of the bridge, where they simply swap vehicles.  

The third and last spy exchange on the Glienicke Bridge also goes smoothly. On 11 February 1986, four prisoners from the East are exchanged for five from the West. After German reunification, this wormhole between the two superpowers reverts to being a normal transport link. But the Bridge of Spies has never lost its fascination. In 2015, director Steven Spielberg visits this original location to shoot his film of the same name starring Tom Hanks.

But the KGB agents still do their best to embarrass him by making him walk across the bridge in oversized trousers without a belt. He is forced to hold up his pants in front of the TV cameras.

",,,"Emperor and Church – a demonstration of power
Cold February skies hang heavy over Berlin as the dignitaries gather in the Lustgarten park. Kaiser Wilhelm II wanted the construction of the cathedral to be finished five years ago. But come what may, it will be consecrated today, on His Majesty's 24th wedding anniversary.

Wilhelm II is not too concerned about the fact that a few bronze doors are still missing and the painting above his personal box is not destined to be completed for many years. After all, he has to take the blame for some of the construction delays. No-one was given the freedom to turn their plans into reality without the Emperor's approval. Wilhelm II repeatedly made his architect, Julius Carl Raschdorff, revise his plans for the cathedral. The Emperor also had the final say on every single element of the cathedral's interior.  

A monument to Church and Emperor  

When you stand on the steps of the cathedral and look up at the richly decorated façade, you feel almost overwhelmed by its grandeur. This is exactly what Wilhelm II intended - for his imperial greatness to be reflected in this divine, monumental building. With the Lustgarten and Altes Museum to the rear and the Hohenzollern City Palace to the right, the new cathedral is the final piece in a complex designed to underline the monarchy's absolute power and the divine right of kings. Commoners and penitents feel very small when they stand before the 114-metre-high church. So it's fitting that the 10 million Reichsmark building costs were considered to be astronomical.  

On this February morning, the grand opening ceremony begins on the dot of 11. Their majesties are given a military welcome, then the head of the cathedral building committee presents Wilhelm II with the key. He hands it to his court chaplain, Ernst Dryander, who ceremoniously opens the cathedral doors. The imperial couple and congregation enter the church to the strains of Handel's Messiah. ""The Empress wears a kindly expression; the Emperor is very stiff and dignified"". This is how the newspapers describe the imperial couple the next day. 

Incongruous splendour  

The magnificent interior of what is now Germany's most important Protestant church takes your breath away. Wilhelm II specifically wants it to rival the mighty Cologne Cathedral. As you stand beneath the magnificent dome, surrounded by gold, marble, mosaics and columns, you could be in a Catholic cathedral. The design of the cathedral is very much to the Kaiser's taste, but the mishmash of architectural styles came under fire long before the building was completed. But now the congregation sings Now Thank We All Our God as the bells of all the Protestant churches in Berlin ring out in honour of the Almighty and his new cathedral.

",,,"An icon of Berlin’s industrial heritage
In Berlin's Moabit district, Huttenstraße is home to a pivotal development in architectural history. In designing the new AEG Turbine Factory, lead architect Peter Behrens and civil engineer Karl Bernhard create the first formal vocabulary for industrial buildings. The Turbine Factory also employs a mix of modern materials - combining primarily steel components and glass with the more traditional stone.

In the early 1900s, AEG is a leading German manufacturer of electrical equipment. To expand its operations, it decides to move into steam turbine production. But for its new division, AEG needs a new large facility, reflecting the global demand for this sector. After all, steam turbines are far more efficient as a source of power than the classic steam engine.

Avant-garde architecture

The commission for the new production hall is awarded to Peter Behrens, an architect and designer who studied at art colleges in Hamburg, Karlsruhe and Düsseldorf. With his strong background in design, he is also employed by AEG as an artistic consultant. Behrens works on product designs, graphics and the company logo - essentially creating AEG's corporate design long before such a term even existed.

Peter Behrens first came to public notice in 1901, with the design of his house in the Darmstadt Artists' Colony. In 1907, he was also a founder member of the Deutscher Werkbund, an association bringing together artists, architects and designers with politicians and industrialists to drive forward the production of high-quality goods. While initially the association drew its inspiration from the English arts and crafts movement, it increasingly turned to focus on architecture.

In the Germany of those days, there is no dedicated architectural style for industrial buildings. Instead, industrial facades simply tend to follow the historicist revivalist styles dominant during those years. In 1908, Behrens' innovative design for the new AEG turbine production hall creates a prototype for modern industrial architecture. The factory hall is constructed with a steel skeleton. The large glass windows filling much of the façade surfaces ensure the interior is light and transparent. The bright, natural light is also seen as a means of increasing productivity.

Visible function

Start by looking at the front façade with its massive stone elements, recalling an Egyptian temple. Set on either side of the large glass window, the stone creates an impression of grandeur, yet neither of these elements are load bearing. They are just for show, merely external cladding. But contemporaries were quick to pick up Behrens' reference to sacral space and soon dubbed the factory hall a machinery cathedral.

In contrast, with visible steel trusses and joints, the side façade in Berlichingenstraße looks very modern - just as Karl Bernhard, the project's civil engineer, intended. In this way, rather than concealed behind a pseudo-historical façade, the industrial building's function as a production site is clearly inscribed in its design.

Even today, Bernhard's role is often underestimated. Far from solely making Behrens's ingenious design a reality, he plays a significant part in its creation. Nonetheless, Behrens, as the famous artist architect, has always outshone Karl Bernhard as a civil engineer. The architects in Peter Behrens' architectural practice include not only Walter Gropius and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, both later renowned figures at the Bauhaus, but also Le Corbusier. Mies van der Rohe even drew the design for the side hall of the AEG Turbine Factory.
",,"The AEG Turbine Factory survived the Second World War largely unscathed. Since 1977, it has belonged to the Siemens complex. AEG only exists now as a brand. Nonetheless, the factory building is still in use - today, producing Siemens gas turbines, a new generation of the turbines produced there in 1909. So even if the technology has constantly developed, the Turbine Factory is still aptly named!

",,,"Biting wit, prickly satire
You're standing in front of one of Berlin's longest and most beautiful façades. The Femina-Palast is an extraordinary testimony to the Roaring Twenties. With its long, 185-metre-long strips of windows, brass door frames and walls clad in travertine, the result is an attractive blend of Bauhaus and Art Deco.

What happens behind the façade is also a source of pride. Jazz greats like Ella Fitzgerald and Duke Ellington perform in the Badewanne, the jazz club in the basement. And on 29 October 1949, it writes a new chapter in political satire when it premieres a cabaret troupe called Die Stachelschweine (The Porcupines). Their first show is retrospectively named Alles irrsinnig komisch (Everything Is Hilarious), and it goes on to be staged every Tuesday and Friday.  

How does humour work in the new democracy? Thierry, whose real name is Dieter Koch, writes the shows with cabaret founder Rolf Ulrich. He comes up with the name Die Stachelschweine because they want to be prickly, pointed and push the envelope of post-war, post-Nazi Germany. Alexander Welbat, Klaus Becker and Joachim Teege are some of the troupe's first freewheeling performers, alongside future TV stars such as Günter Pfitzmann.  

The second show, called per-speck-tiefen, opens up new horizons for the young ensemble. At the Badewanne, conflicts with another cabaret troupe lead to a change of venue. The Stachelschweine move to the Burgkeller restaurant at Kurfürstendamm 12 in February 1950. Their involuntary tour continues via the Nürnberger Trichter restaurant to the Ewige Lampe at Rankestraße 9, where the ensemble stays for twelve years.  

Straight-talking, Berlin style 

Over the years, the Stachelschweine has included numerous witty, sharp-tongued cabaret artists who have shaped the cabaret genre in Berlin. Achim Strietzel is so good at imitating Governing Mayor Willy Brandt that people stop him in the street and ask him to ""Do Willy"". Then there's fast-talking Wolfgang Gruber; Wolfgang Neuss, whose famous catchphrase is available today as a fridge magnet; and Berlin's own Edith Hancke, who began her long career with the Stachelschweine in the Fifties. When she died, Berlin's newspaper Der Tagesspiegel simply headlined her obituary: ""The eternal brat"". 

They all turn the politics of reconstruction and economic miracle into satire - and some of the audience find their laughter sticks in their throats. Subversive and enigmatic, the Stachelschweine turn the spotlight on the Nazi heritage, the grotesqueness of two German states and the neuroses that develop in a front-line city like Berlin. The troupe survived the division of Germany and still play seven nights a week at the Europa-Center.
",,"The Stachelschweine celebrate their 5th, 10th and 15th anniversaries with a run of special sold-out shows at Berlin Sports Palace, which was demolished in 1973. This venue is also known as the site of Joseph Goebbels' propaganda speech about ""total war"", given in 1943.

",,,"The sunken library
The evening of 10 May 1933. It's pouring with rain. A huge bonfire has been built in the centre of the square known as Opernplatz. The logs have been placed on top of piles of sand to protect the old cobblestones. 5,000 students from Berlin University show up to watch the ritual burning. Many of them are wearing the brown and black shirts of the SA and SS.

Burning torches held aloft, hundreds of Brownshirts are on the march from Gendarmenmarkt to Opernplatz. Some are carrying banners with the words ""Against the Un-German Spirit"".  Several trucks pull up on the square. They are loaded with around 300,000 books, pillaged from the surrounding libraries. 

This impressive spectacle has been organised by the National Socialist German Student Association. They have drawn up blacklists containing the names of 130 authors, including Heinrich, Thomas and Klaus Mann, Kurt Tucholsky, Heinrich Heine, Franz Kafka and Bertolt Brecht. In the jargon of the National Socialists, their works are ""undesirable, decadent, un-German literature"". 

""Fire oaths"" and a carnival atmosphere  

A large crowd is gathering on the square. It includes students, teaching staff and curious onlookers. The smell of wood and bratwurst is in the air. A brass band strikes up. There's a real carnival atmosphere. The Deutsche Wochenschau newsreel team are filming, and their spotlights bathe the square in a harsh light.  

The students throw the first books onto the fire, but it struggles to get going. It's raining so hard that the flames keep going out. The square fills with smoke. The fire brigade arrives and pours petrol on the flames. Finally, the books begin to burn. Young men hurl piles of books into the flames, while the loudspeakers blare out ""fire oaths"": ""Against class struggle and materialism, for national community and idealistic lifestyle! I consign the works of Marx and Kautsky to the flames."" They trumpet the names of another 15 authors. That night, many writers' works go up in smoke.  

Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels arrives around midnight. He did not order the book burning, but he's delighted that the students have taken the initiative. He climbs onto a pedestal and gives an incendiary speech, railing against the ""un-German spirit"".   

The sunken library 

Today, Opernplatz is called Bebelplatz. When you stroll across the square, you often come across people looking at a particular spot on the ground. When you get closer, you see a glass plate set into the paving stones. Below is an underground room with empty bookshelves - with space to hold around 20,000 books. This sunken library is a memorial created by Israeli artist Micha Ullman. A bronze plate set into the ground bears Heinrich Heine's warning from 1820: ""...where they burn books, they will ultimately burn people"".

",,,"Planning and experimenting for Germania
Adolf Hitler is clearly impressed by the four-metre-high model of a triumphal arch. It's a present for his 50th birthday. General Building Inspector Albert Speer is pleased with his choice of gift. Years earlier, Hitler had given him a sketch of a triumphal arch that he had drawn himself. Now it is to be the centrepiece of the new imperial capital of Germania. The arch never gets built, but Berlin still bears the traces of this gigantic building project.

The sheer size of the world's biggest triumphal arch Is hard to grasp. The Arc de Triomphe in Paris would fit into it several times. But that's also a worry for Albert Speer - is it actually structurally possible to build such an arch?  

Sandy Berlin  

The General Building Inspector has a problem. Unlike other major European cities, Berlin is not built on rock, but on sand. That presents something of a challenge for his building plans. To be on the safe side, Speer orders the construction of a test load structure. 

You are now standing on a viewing platform on General-Pape-Strasse. If you look to the north, you will see a huge grey cylinder sticking out of the ground between the trees. This is the structure now known as the Heavy Load-Bearing Body. Its only function was to simulate the weight of the planned triumphal arch and the pressure it would exert on Berlin's sandy substrata. Is it possible for the marshy, sandy ground to support such a building? Now look behind you, to the south, and you are looking at the spot where the triumphal arch was due to soar to the heavens as a memorial to the fallen soldiers of the First World War.  

With typical Prussian thoroughness, engineers examine the impression made by the 12,650-tonne concrete block and take measurements in the soil. They find it has sunk by 19.4 centimetres, more than expected. But the engineers don't give up hope. They believe the triumphal arch can still be built if they stabilise the soil. Fortunately, it never comes to that.   

During opening hours, you can also look around the inside of the structure. Below ground, the building is 18 metres deep and there are places where you can look all the way down. 

Germania needs space 

The Heavy Load-Bearing Body is, quite literally, a concrete reminder of the planning carried out by the General Building Inspector. But traces of these plans can be found in other parts of the city. The one thing Speer needs for his massive buildings is space, and lots of it. The Victory Column stands in the way of his plans to build the world's largest domed building, the Hall of the People. So he has the column moved from its spot in front of the Reichstag building to the centre of the Great Star road intersection.  

Speer is even more radical when it comes to residential buildings. Tens of thousands of them will need to be demolished. But what about the people who lose their homes? Some of them can be accommodated in new settlements on the outskirts of the city. The Jewish population is also affected by the Nazis' plans, but they are simply forced to leave without legal justification or compensation for the loss of their homes. At least Speer's monstrous architectural vision never becomes reality.

",,,"The birthplace of Berlin’s club scene
The Mall of Berlin on Leipziger Platz stands on the site of a legendary club. In 1990, Dimitri Hegemann stepped into the basement of the former Wertheim department store. He was engulfed by a wave of cold, musty air as he entered a rusting steel chamber - the vault of the former Globus Reisebank.

""The first time we went in, we had no idea what to expect. We used a cigarette lighter to see where we were going. There were white tiles everywhere. Then suddenly there was another room, a steel door, we saw the safety deposit boxes, the window bars, and we were speechless. We immediately knew this place was something special."" Three months later Hegemann opens Tresor, Berlin's first techno club, in the vault.  

A touch of anarchy 

So how do you stumble upon an abandoned bank vault in the centre of Berlin? When the Wall comes down, the city is left in limbo. The GDR's laws no longer apply, and no new rules have been made. Squatters move into empty buildings, the East German police are at a loss and simply ignored, illegal clubs spring up. A breath of anarchy is blowing through the formerly divided city.  

This chaotic situation combines with the euphoria of Berlin's reunited citizens. All over the city, they are celebrating their new-found freedom: in former factories and overground bunkers, on car park roofs, in abandoned cellars. Many of the new clubs are named after their previous function, and suddenly E-Werk, Tresor, and Bunker are throbbing to one beat - techno. It's the soundtrack to the fall of the Wall.   

""Like a good wine, a good club gets better with age"" 

The techno clubs of the Nineties attract clubbers from all over the world. Dimitri Hegemann plays a key role in this, flying in top international DJs like Jeff Mills and Juan Atkins. Tresor still exists today. In an interview in 2016, Hegemann suggests than an unusual location is the key to lasting success: ""The club wouldn't have been as popular if we hadn't set it up in its old location, that rusting vault under the former Wertheim building on Leipziger Platz."" 

He adds that a good club is like good wine - it gets better with age. When the former Wertheim department store is demolished in 2007, Tresor moves to Köpenicker Strasse. But its success continues. Every weekend, people still flock to Berlin to party in Hegemann's Tresor - surrounded by barred windows and safety deposit boxes.

",,,"The fall of the grey fortress
On 15 January 1990, a peaceful demonstration at the Stasi headquarters turned into a furious attack on the secret service's grey fortress. But most agents had already left the complex. 

It is early evening on 15 January 1990. Pastor and civil rights activist Martin Montag from Thuringia can hardly believe what is happening. He is standing at the Stasi headquarters in Berlin-Lichtenberg, trying to persuade demonstrators not to storm the Ministry of State Security. 

How come a clergyman who is opposed to the regime is attempting to protect East Germany's hated secret police from an angry mob? 

This unlikely situation has come about because, all day long, the Ministry has been haunted by its political opponents. At midday on 15 January 1990, civil rights groups led by Martin Montag ""occupied"" the building during a peaceful visit to negotiate the dissolution of this organisation. 

Protesters bring radical change   

At this point, nobody imagines that a public demonstration which, by chance, has been planned for the same day will radically alter the course of events.  

A small crowd is expected, but in facts tens of thousands of East German citizens show up, all bursting with anger and indignation about being spied upon for the last 40 years. They force their way into the once impenetrable Stasi headquarters, opening up the gates from the inside. Overwhelmed, the police can do nothing to hold back the angry mob. Even Martin Montag has to stand back. 

Go through the main gate and enter the complex on Normannenstraße. Take a left - towards Building 18 - and you are following the exact route taken by those protesters 28 years ago. Today it's very peaceful, but at that time your ears would have been ringing. Thousands of voices chanting ""Down with the Stasi!"". A placard depicting Erich Honecker dressed as a convict. Glass flying around as windows are shattered.  But for some protesters, their sense of triumph at storming the building mingles with a sense of unease. What if they are attacked by the Stasi? 

The Prime Minister's appeals for calm fall on deaf ears     

But where are all the Stasi agents? It seems they have given up their supposedly impenetrable fortress without a fight. But that's hardly surprising, as they had already begun shredding files back in October 1989. 

The rioters soon realise there's nothing to find. In their fury they break windows, smash office equipment, ransack a hair salon, plunder a storeroom and refuse to be placated by the words of Prime Minister Hans Modrow, who has rushed to the scene. 

The demonstrators rampage unhindered around Building 18, but in fact they marched straight past the Stasi's true centre of power right at the start. 

But one thing is clear - on the evening of 15 January 1990 the people of East Germany liberated themselves from the hated secret police. However, their victory was largely symbolic, as even the secret service had grounds for feeling they had come out on top. Ultimately, the people's rage only led to modest amounts of damage to an ancillary building. And the protesters failed to get their hands on a single important file.

In 1872, he opens a branch in Berlin's Friedrichstraße, followed by restaurants in Leipziger Strasse and on Kurfürstendamm. In 1928, the Kempinski business takes over the Hotel Vaterland at Potsdamer Platz.  

The golden years end in 1933. Across Germany, the Nazi regime organises boycotts of Jewish shops and businesses - a campaign also affecting the restaurant. At the same time, they start the ""Aryanisation"" - the compulsory sale - of Jewish firms. Large companies like Kempinski are not initially targeted - they are too important for the German economy.  

A tragic end 

In 1937, Richard Unger, Berthold Kempinski's son-in-law, has to negotiate the forced sale of the Kempinski group. Aschinger, one of Europe's largest hotel and restaurant companies, is keen to take it over. Aschinger promises ""top quality at the lowest prices"" - and has strong business links with the Nazi regime.  

On 29 April 1937, after protracted negotiations, the Kempinski business becomes a limited company, a subsidiary of Aschinger. The Kempinski family no longer have a say in the business. Nearly all the family members leave Germany. Walter Unger, the son of the main shareholder, remains in Germany to wind up the business. He hopes to save parts of it - a vain hope.  

In 1938, Walter Unger is arrested and taken to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. In January 1939, he is brought back to the Kempinski Restaurant once more, for the final renegotiation. Four years later, Walter Unger is deported as number 014387 to Theresienstadt concentration camp. In 1944, he is murdered in Auschwitz.
",,"Richard Tauber is a celebrated opera star. In 1933, he spends his last evening in Germany in the Kempinski Restaurant. When Tauber wants to enter the restaurant, he is assaulted by the SA Brownshirts. ""Jewish lout! Get out of Germany!"", they yell at him, punching him several times in his face. The same night Tauber leaves Germany forever.

",,,"Miss Columbia and the dream of flight
On 6 June 1927, 150,000 people stream onto the Tempelhofer Feld. Only the fortunate few can realise the dream of flight, but wherever planes touch down, they quickly draw huge crowds. On Tempelhofer Feld, these aviation enthusiasts are waiting to welcome Clarence Chamberlin. His planned non-stop flight from New York to Berlin is front-page news. Accompanied by millionaire Charles Levine, Chamberlin hopes to break Lindbergh's record transatlantic flight just a few days before. But just short of Magdeburg, Chamberlin runs out of fuel. His single engine Wright-Bellanca WB-2, christened the Columbia, has to land near Eisleben. The massed crowd in Berlin waits in vain for the record-breaking plane.

After refuelling the next day, Chamberlin manages to miss Berlin. He stops over in Cottbus and finally lands on Tempelhofer Feld to a rapturous reception. Sirens announce Chamberlin's imminent arrival. The crowd roars out a welcome when Miss Columbia, as the plane is nicknamed, appears on the horizon flanked by other aircraft. Two years later, the road past the Tempelhofer Feld is officially named Columbiadamm in honour of Chamberlin's plane.

The new airport

Today, when you stand on the Tempelhofer Feld, you are on a vast park called the Tempelhofer Freiheit - ""Tempelhof Freedom"". Here, in the heart of the city, you can look out across kilometres of this former airfield, now open parkland. There are just a few trees standing in the centre. Today, hardly anyone knows that this exact spot is the site of first Tempelhof Airport. Here, aviation history was written. For two hundred years, the Prussian Army uses this vast area as an exercise ground. In the early 1900s, aviation pioneers give their flying displays here. Then, on 8 October 1923, Tempelhofer Feld airport opens.

In those early years, it's a modest operation with only a few hangers for planes. During the airport's first year, just 150 passengers fly out from the Tempelhofer Feld. No planes are allowed to start or land on Sundays, and since the aircraft are not heated, no passenger planes fly in winter.

Just a few years later, the world looks a very different place. The Deutsche Luft Hansa Aktiengesellschaft (German Air Hansa Company) makes Tempelhof its home airport. Finally, the airfield can boast a dark-red brick airport building. The signature feature is two red-and-white radio towers. Despite the paint, they still look remarkably like the Funkturm Radio Tower at Berlin's fairs and exhibitions ground - which is no surprise as they are designed by the same architect, Heinrich Straumer.

Always against the wind

In 1929, the airport building is finished - already much too small for the volume of air traffic. Plans are already made for a new building, later built under the Nazi regime. After the war, the first airport building disappears almost without trace. Today, only the Tempelhofer Freiheit park's round shape recalls the old airport. With these early aircraft always having to start into the wind, the first airfield only has a circular grassed area and not concrete runways. In this way, these light propeller aircraft were free to start in any direction - a tradition of freedom still thriving on today's Tempelhofer Freiheit park.

",,,"Death of a bank
Imagine that it's Monday morning and you're on your way to work. You walk past Danatbank, a branch of Germany's second-largest bank here on Nollendorfplatz. People have gathered around a notice saying Danatbank is temporarily closed, but all savings deposits are safe as the government will guarantee these deposits and maintain business as usual.

The notice is meant to be reassuring, but unfortunately it has quite the opposite effect. Now you're thinking you're glad your account is with the Sparkasse, not Danatbank. But you still rush round there to withdraw your money, just in case. You find yourself standing in a long queue at the Sparkasse. The run on the banks has begun. By 11.30 on the morning of 13 July 1931, the banks can no longer cope with the stampede of customers. Berliner Sparkasse alone has to pay out seven million Reichsmark. Bank holidays are declared to keep the banking system from total collapse. ""Holidays"" sounds harmless enough, but these prove to be dark days for the financial sector. Nobody can access their savings, and monetary transactions grind to a halt for weeks on end. 

Despair and distrust 

The banking crisis is homemade. German banks have taken out short-term foreign loans and used the money to offer longer-term loans to German companies - but without adequate capital to cover these longer terms. German industry is struggling after the stock market crash of 1929. Foreign creditors are getting jittery about the success of extremists in the Reichstag elections of September 1930 - especially the Nazi Party, which gets 18.3 percent of the vote. Confidence starts to wane in the reliability of German companies and the stability of the German government. Hundreds of millions of Reichsmark are withdrawn and the Reichsbank is running out of cash. Germany is on the verge of insolvency. 

Bail-outs, nationalisations and a bad bank 

The Danatbank is the worst hit. Its head is Jakob Goldschmidt, one of Germany's best-known bankers, but he has overcooked the bank's expansion with some risky lending. The collapse of the Bremer Nordwolle company, which had disguised its losses and falsified its balance sheets, has dragged Danatbank into the red. Attempts to set up a solidarity package are unsuccessful after resistance from the bank's competitors - other major banks are not keen to get their fingers burned. 

Standstill agreements with foreign lenders and the suspension of reparation payments help to calm the situation, and the introduction of a regulatory system shows that politicians are looking for long-term solutions. But it's too late for Danatbank, which is taken over by the state-owned Dresdner Bank. Other big banks like Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank are restructured with state aid. And a crisis management instrument is introduced that has a familiar ring to it. An acceptance house and guarantee bank is set up to provide guarantees to the Reichsbank and allow troubled credit institutions to secure additional capital - the historical equivalent of a bad bank.
",,"The Berliner Handels-Gesellschaft is the only major bank to survive the crisis without a state bail-out. For the other banks, it takes until 1936 before their partial nationalisation is reversed through private buy-backs.

",,,"Exoticism and delusions of grandeur
It's an autumn evening in 1928. We're standing in front of the Haus Vaterland (Fatherland House). Behind us we hear the roar of the traffic on Potsdamer Platz. Dozens of people are streaming into the huge, brightly-lit building. Everyone is curious. Just like us, they can't wait to see what this new pleasure palace has to offer.

Come with me on a tour of the building! There's a huge cinema and a dance hall with sprung parquet flooring. And there are so many places to eat and drink, all run by the famous Kempinski family. Let's start off in the Café Vaterland. We sit at one of hundreds of tables illuminated by magnificent chandeliers. The walls are adorned with paintings, marble and mosaics, and the cafe has a modern, sophisticated feel. But we're looking for a touch of exoticism and extravagance. 

Rhinish gaiety or Bavarian cosiness? 

Let's take a peek at the Rhineland Terrace. Its main attraction is a 3D river diorama. In the background there's a painting of the Rhine valley, complete with castle ruins. In front there is a river with actual water and model boats. First you hear the birds twittering. Then a storm moves in with rain, thunder and lightning. And finally a rainbow appears - the storm is over. But none of the guests get wet. A pane of glass prevents you from getting soaked and saves your Rhineland wine from being diluted.  

Maybe you prefer beer to wine? Let's head for the Löwenbräu. This beer cellar features a two-storey-high glass painting of the Eibsee lake and the Zugspitze mountain. Backlighting creates a range of effects, such as the morning sun and the alpenglow. Bavarian music, Bavarian dancing and, of course, Bavarian beer are also on the menu. 

A quick trip to Turkey, Hungary or the Wild West? 

At the Haus Vaterland you can also travel further afield. There's a Turkish café that is ""surely more beautiful than any in the whole of Turkey"", as it is described by the Vossische Zeitung. Or we can go to the Hungarian Czarda, a peasant tavern from the Puszta, where ""fiery"" music gives the evening a more melancholy feel. The walls of the Wild West Bar make it look like a log cabin, and it has a diorama of the Rocky Mountains. Perhaps we'll be served by Mohamed Husen in his cowboy gear. He's actually from East Africa, not North America - but we don't need to get too hung up on the details.  

We finish our tour in Vienna. In the Grinzinger Heuriger tavern you sit under a lilac bower listening to the sounds of the waltz while enjoying fine wine and Viennese delicacies. But now you've probably had enough. The Haus Vaterland knows how to overwhelm your eyes, ears and taste buds! I hope you've enjoyed your tour and it wasn't too crowded - despite the fact that it has had 8,000 visitors today.

",,,"State apparatchiks are booed off the stage
The biggest demonstration in the history of the GDR takes place five days before the fall of the Berlin Wall. In front of the crowd on Alexanderplatz, artists and functionaries demand a new political beginning. Nobody is thinking about reunification - but then again, nobody believes that socialism can be saved either.

It is 4 November 1989, and Markus Wolf, who has headed up the dreaded GDR foreign intelligence service for the last 34 years, appears before a crowd of demonstrators who have gathered in Alexanderplatz. He is met by a chorus of jeers and boos. The hands of the once powerful man start to shake. Civil rights activist Bärbel Bohley notices his nervousness and in that moment realises for the very first time that ""The revolution is irreversible"".  

Less than a month earlier and the GDR is celebrating its 40th birthday with an ostentatious military parade for state visitors such as Mikhail Gorbachev and Nicolae Ceausescu. Although they don't realise it at the time, this is the day that the SED leadership will sow the seeds for the Alexanderplatz demonstration a few weeks later - because citizens protesting against the anniversary celebrations are brutally chased away and beaten by the People's Police and the Stasi.   

The demo is not anti-GDR, but pro-democracy  

However, the organs of state security do not intimidate the GDR's dissidents with this orgy of violence. Quite the opposite: the citizens' movement New Forum and representatives of East Berlin's theatres use the attacks as justification for calling the demonstration on 4 November. The strategy adopted by the civil rights activists and regime critics is simple - they are not demonstrating against the GDR but in favour of a new democratic socialism, freedom of speech and freedom of the press. 

When the event kicks off at 10am on 4 November in front of the ADN (General German Intelligence Service) building in Mollstraße, it quickly develops into the biggest non-governmental demonstration in the history of the GDR. Hundreds of thousands of people converge on the Palast der Republik before moving on to Alexanderplatz for the final rally with 20 speakers from the arts and politics. 

The protesters come up with some witty and creative slogans for their banners, such as ""Send the Stasi to Benghazi"".

The intellectuals want to save the GDR, but it's too late  

Feelings in the country are running so high that the rally is even broadcast on GDR television. Stasi shills among the demonstrators have little effect - the crowd cheers loudly for authors like Christa Wolf and actors Ulrich Mühe and Jan Josef Liefers, while Politburo member Günter Schabowski and former spy Markus Wolf are mercilessly booed and jeered. 

Looking back, historian Ilko-Sascha Kowalczuk believes that ""The event was sustained by a belief that nothing should remain as it is"",  ""Freedom had to come"". 

Christa Wolf, Friedrich Schorlemmer and other speakers call on people not to leave the country - but these intellectuals are also a little out of touch with the prevailing mood. That weekend alone, more than 60,000 mainly young citizens flee the GDR through third countries. It's already too late to save the first socialist state on German soil.

",,,"Have you got two million marks?
It's the mid-1970s. The Kreuzberg district of Berlin, home to leftists, anarchists and punks, is being hit by a wave of demolitions. The area is being systematically torn apart. The people of Kreuzberg decide to resist the destruction and start occupying empty houses. Graffiti proclaiming Legal, illegal, don't give a shit! starts to appear on walls around the neighbourhood.

Something strange is happening in the courtyard behind Gneisenaustraße 2, where you're standing now. An alternative project is in the pipeline. The organisers have even set up an official property management company so that they can buy the premises of what was previously the Berthold foundry. A 5,000-square-metre courtyard for just under two million D-Mark. The Mehringhof collective is keen to ensure that it does everything legally and above board.  

It all starts with a grass-roots school 

At the end of the 1970s, the SFE school - which you can still attend in the Mehringhof today - was desperately in need of new premises. This independent college provides adults with a second chance at education. In the Seventies, it was expanding and open to new joint ventures. The result was a merger with other similar, like-minded initiatives and the decision to move into Gneisenaustraße 2 as joint owners. Regular monthly meetings were held to approve new tenants, how much money should be spent on the buildings, and what the theme of the next Mehringhof Festival should be.   

Alternative, democratic, united  

Today, the courtyard is still home to a unique mix of projects and businesses. The brick buildings provide every tenant with all the space they need. With its reputation for tolerance, the Mehringhof is a breeding ground for radical, leftist and collective ideas. Alongside the bike shop, theatre, print workshop and pub you will also find a medical centre for refugees, a Latin American newspaper, a Turkish workers' association and an emergency shelter that provides the homeless with a refuge on cold winter nights. Schwarze Risse was originally set up as an information centre for the anti-nuclear movement, but for the last 40 years, it has been a bookshop with a distinctly political flavour. 

Back in 1979, no-one imagined that the organisations, shops, initiatives and projects that make up the Mehringhof would still be operating independently 40 years later. It was quite an achievement to use capital to thumb its nose at the capitalism that was threatening to destroy Kreuzberg.

On 6 January 1986, former Poilitburo member Herbert Häber is ordered to go to the East German government hospital, from where he is taken to Bernburg Psychiatric Hospital. Completely taken by surprise, Häber is deemed a ""hopeless case"" and locked up in the secure wing. Erich Honecker has arranged for his former expert on relations with the West to be sidelined.

The Häber case highlights the dangers of belonging to the GDR's inner circle in the 1980s. The Politburo might be the state's most powerful body, but its leader wields the true power. Since 1971 this has been Erich Honecker.  

Every Tuesday morning, Politburo members pull up on Marx-Engels-Platz in Berlin-Mitte in their Volvo limousines. This building on Werderscher Markt opened as the Reichsbank in 1940. It is the very building where the Politburo met every week at 10am sharp.  

Honecker would open the meeting, then decisions would be made about everything from economic plans to car prices, building projects and parades. The Politburo wields unlimited power and ministers in the elected government are bound by its directives. This is how East Germany is governed.  

Later, Politburo member Günter Schabowski describes the meetings as having a ""classroom atmosphere"". Honecker is the teacher, the others are the students. The 15 to 25 voting members and 10 non-voting candidate members do not enter into any heated debates. The General Secretary has gathered a group of yes-men and opportunists, and at the end of the day he makes the final decision.   

Their ritualistic nodding and blind faith in their leader eventually come home to roost. The members of the Politburo - many of whom are well past retirement age - fail to act when the mass exodus of East German citizens begins in 1989. They are either away on holiday or simply look on apathetically. Even the General Secretary is away from his post. He's recovering from a gall bladder operation.  

When Honecker returns for the Politburo meeting 17 October 1989, he asks for ""proposals for the agenda"". Willi Stoph proposes that Honecker be released from his duties. The boss is speechless. Günter Schabowski later recalls that Honecker's reaction was ""50 percent bewilderment and 50 percent not wanting to believe it"". Now even Honecker's loyal comrades are stabbing him in the back. The Politburo votes unanimously to dismiss him, and Honecker even raises his own hand in agreement - as is the tradition.  

What happened to the Politburo's former scapegoat Herbert Häber, who had been committed to a psychiatric hospital three years earlier? He fared somewhat better than Honecker and was discharged by a brave doctor with little interest in political intrigue. But in 2004 he is found guilty on three counts of incitement to murder.

It is addressed to Hitler's personal physician Karl Brandt and Philipp Bouhler, Chief of the Chancellery of the Führer. In his letter, Hitler authorises the two men to carry out the ""mercy killing"" of anyone who is allegedly suffering from an incurable disease. The department charged with carrying out this programme of mass murder is set up at Tiergartenstrasse 4, under the codename T4.

Karl Ahrendt, a coachman, was one of the victims of the National Socialists' euthanasia programme. In 1907, when Germany was still under imperial rule, he was arrested on Alexanderplatz. Ahrendt was wearing a general's coat and trying to pass himself off as a prince. The doctors said he was confused and a danger to the public. He was admitted to a mental hospital where he lived inside his own head &not;- and spent his time sketching. Many of his surreal drawings have survived to this day. In 1941 the National Socialists sent Ahrendt to the gas chamber.  

Crime of the century 

Euthanasia, from the Greek for ""good death"" is not a new idea developed by the Nazis. Long before 1933, doctors and politicians in Europe had discussed the possibility of euthanasia for the terminally ill, people with physical and mental disabilities, and children with hereditary diseases. But for the Nazis, it becomes a guiding principle - they want to systematically terminate the lives of people who they deem ""unworthy of life"" according to their own particular criteria.  

The ""desk murderers"" in the Tiergarten villa 

Berlin, Tiergartenstraße 4. In front of you is a wall of blue glass. You are standing on what used to be the ground floor of one of the most magnificent villas in the Tiergarten. It was destroyed during the Second World War. An information centre and memorial to the victims of the National Socialist ""euthanasia"" murder programme opened here in 2014. Between 1940 and 1945, some 60 civil servants planned and organised the mass murder of people with mental disabilities. They were mainly people who were ""just following orders"": doctors, administrators, secretaries, tradesmen, photographers, drivers.  

The office staff in Tiergartenstraße send out registration forms to psychiatric institutions and nursing homes. The resident physicians dutifully fill out the forms. They note the patient's condition, the amount of care required, and the work involved. At the bottom of the document there is a black box that has to be left empty. Once the form is returned to Tiergartenstraße an assessor decides whether the patient should live or die. A minus in the black box means the patient can go on living. A plus is a death sentence. The office staff organise the final journeys of those who are condemned to death. They draw up transportation lists. Buses carry the patients to one of six killing centres, where they are gassed. No one here on Tiergartenstrasse ever sees any of the victims. 

Protests by church institutions lead to the Aktion T4 programme being officially discontinued in August 1941. But the killing continues in secret in sanatoriums and nursing homes. It is estimated that some 300,000 people across Europe are victims of the euthanasia programme.

The sign at the entrance to the museum is controversial: ""Admission: People: 20 pfennigs - Soldiers: free"" The state prosecutor believes soldiers are being treated as non-humans. Museum director Ernst Friedrich is fined 100 Reichsmarks for denigrating the German army and undermining state authority. This isn't the first time that the anarchist and radical pacifist has come into conflict with the law - and it won't be the last.

War against war!

For a generation of soldiers traumatised by the horrors of World War I, Ernst Friedrich's Anti-War Museum touches on many taboos. The myth of dying a glorious, heroic death for the fatherland is contrasted with the horrific reality of industrial mass murder. Soon after the museum opens in October 1925, the police arrive and remove pictures of deformed faces, mutilated bodies and shattered corpses from the display window.

The shocking pictures come from Friedrich's book Krieg dem Kriege! (War Against War!), which brings him international attention in 1924. He uses the proceeds from this bestseller to set up the ""first international anti-war museum"" in a dilapidated house in Parochialstraße. Photos of victims and perpetrators are placed next to drawings by Otto Dix and Käthe Kollwitz. Weapons, medals and war toys are displayed alongside ration cards and prostheses, all accompanied by sarcastic captions. German and French steel helmets have been turned into flower pots. Above the entrance hangs the symbol of conscientious objectors - two hands holding aloft a broken rifle.

""From peace museum to Hitler barracks"" 

As a conscientious objector, Ernst Friedrich is initially sent to prison during the First World War, and then committed to an asylum. After his release in November 1918, he campaigns against the state and the military, against enforced obedience and violence. His passionate commitment to peace in his lectures and writings soon brings the ""peace agitator"" back into conflict with the authorities. A dozen court cases result in him spending three years in prison, but they also bring Friedrich into the public eye. It is rare to see a soldier in his museum, but he has more success with children and teenagers. For some, such as the futurologist Robert Jungk, a visit to the Anti-War Museum becomes a life-changing event. 

In the final years of the Weimar Republic, Friedrich increasingly finds himself fighting a losing battle. In 1930 he is sentenced to one year in prison. The windows of his museum are smashed, and he is injured in one of the attacks. The sign ""Closed due to chronic pecuniary embarrassment!"" appears more regularly in the window. In February 1933, the SA storm the museum, destroy the exhibits and set up a torture chamber in the cellar. Friedrich is taken into protective custody and eventually flees the country in December. Before long, the destruction of the reminders of the atrocities of one World War is followed by the murder and devastation of another.

Outside, the crowd is held back by a red and white barrier. Then everyone reaches out and tears down the barrier. A symbolic gesture - the barrier is made of cardboard. On the other side? Not Poland but a Berlin club. The crowd cheers. It's a great moment in German/Polish history.

It's early evening, 17 years later. Now you're standing outside Ackerstraße 169. Ivy creeps up the building to the first floor. The door stands open. Come in, come in! Fresh air pours in, but you can still see and smell the traces of yesterday's party. You hear the clink of empties as Piotr Mordel gathers them up. The chairs are quickly set out and a reading begins here in the new premises of the Club of Polish Losers.  

The city's most active losers 

The four founders, including Mordel, arrived in West Berlin shortly before the Berlin Wall came down. They were all well qualified, but none of them could find a job. So they decided to handle this frustrating situation with creativity - and a touch of typically Polish irony. In 1994 they published their Little Manifesto of Polish Losers.  

""We're few and far between in this town. There's maybe twenty or thirty of us. The rest are cool, successful types, cold-blooded experts... We - the weak, the less talented, can't really achieve anything"".

The club opens on 1 September 2001. Next door, writer Wladimir Kaminer is already spreading a little East European culture with his Kaffee Burger and Russian disco. It's an inspiring neighbourhood. Briefly known as the CPV, the club is a mixture of pub, cinema and cultural venue. The four founders set it up as a non-profit association. Even after it moves to Ackerstraße, it continues to present a diverse and alternative cultural programme. The club is like a skeleton key, says one of its founders, Adam Gusowski: ""It opens doors for us and allows us to communicate with society."" The magic password? The club is open when it's not closed. It's as simple as that.  

From political satire to political party  

The club's focus is on celebrating losers and failure in all its aspects. Political satire is a favourite weapon for countering German clichés about Poland.  

In 2018, the Club of Polish Losers sets up its own political party. The goal of the PPD, the Polish Party of Germany, is ""...to explain, learn and demonstrate how processes work and what democracy does, using humour but with a serious intent"". And perhaps to open another chapter in the history of successful failure - ""we're not only interested in taking power, but above all we want to see a Polish Chancellor."" 
",,"The Club of Polish Losers is suing ARD, Germany's public-service broadcaster. It aired a TV film called Seit Du da bist, which featured a pub with the same name. It's a sleazy place where people go to drink vodka, eat gherkins and sing Russian songs. The CPV is determined to uphold its good reputation as a non-profit cultural institution.

Marlou van Rhijn was born without lower legs in 1991. At the 2012 Paralympics in London, the Dutch sprinter set a new world record for the 100 and 200 metres - with the help of high-tech carbon-fibre prostheses made by the German company Ottobock. The prosthetics manufacturer is based at the Ottobock Science Center on Potsdamer Platz.

Freedom through movement 

White rooms, digital panels, computer simulations, artificial limbs - is this a glimpse of the future? Or is it the latest science fiction movie? In fact, it's a normal day at the Ottobock Science Center in Berlin. Ottobock has been developing cutting-edge medical technology for the last 100 years. Its prostheses, orthoses and wheelchairs give disabled people a whole new level of mobility. And when you visit the Science Center, the company beams you to new worlds. 

The central theme of the exhibition is understanding what moves us. How do humans balance? How does it feel to travel around Berlin in a wheelchair? What happens to our legs when we sprint? For professional athletes like Marlou van Rhijn, that's an important question. When the two-time world champion tries out her new running blades before the 2016 Paralympics in Rio she is blown away: ""Wow, these are exactly what I've been looking for. I can't wait to line up at the start."" 

As soon as you approach the Science Center building you can tell that the future is at home here. The building has a very futuristic look. The brilliant white panels of its façade are designed to look like human muscle fibres. It represents how technology and nature are intertwined, just like in bionics, which takes concepts from biology and transfers them to technology. This is how it is possible to make lifelike prostheses. The next step is artificial legs that are controlled by the mind.  

Ottobock goes for gold 

Ottobock has always worked closely with the Paralympics by developing new prostheses for athletes and sending staff to the games to support the Paralympians. Sprint world champion Heinrich Popow is one of its customers. In 2017 Popow took part in Let's dance, a TV show aired on RTL. He said he was keen to inspire people with disabilities to take up sport. At the 2016 Paralympics in Rio, Popow took gold in the long jump, while Marlou van Rhijn won two sprint golds. When you visit the Ottobock Science Center you can take a close look at the athletes' running blades and watch a team of robots playing football. And you won't see any ""Do not touch"" signs - you're encouraged to try things out for yourself!

",,,"Operation Valkyrie – the failed attempt to liberate Germany
It's just before midnight on 20 July 1944. In the courtyard of the Bendlerblock, members of the Berlin Guard Battalion of the German Wehrmacht line up to form a firing squad. The headlights of a flatbed truck illuminate a pile of sand. Volleys of gunfire ring out, one after another. Their targets are General Friedrich Olbricht, Colonel Albrecht Mertz von Quirnheim, Lieutenant Werner von Haeften - and Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg. Before he is hit by the fatal shots, Stauffenberg is said to have shouted: ""Long live our sacred Germany!"" 

The massive grey façade of the Bendlerblock faces onto the Landwehr Canal. There's been a military presence here from the very beginning. The Imperial Navy moved in in 1911, followed by the Ministry of the Reichswehr and the army command of the Weimar Republic. During the Third Reich, the high command of the army and reserve army were based in the massive building. And it is here that General Friedrich Olbricht and his co-conspirators draw up plans for the coup - codename Operation Valkyrie. 

The plan is for Stauffenberg to assassinate the dictator Adolf Hitler by bombing his Wolf's Lair headquarters on 20 July 1944. The unjust and brutal war has placed many officers in a moral dilemma. The conservative elites reject National Socialism, the barbaric war and the murder of European Jews. They conclude the war has been lost. They join forces with other resistance groups to plan the assassination. But the attack fails. Hitler survives - and takes revenge on the conspirators.  

Chained, but with heads held high 

The east wing of the building borders Stauffenbergstraße. When you enter the courtyard from here, you see two long metal plinths of different heights in the centre of the yard. This is the exact spot where the sand was piled up on the night of the executions on 20 July 1944. The four men were made to line up here one by one. At the far end of the courtyard you can see several lime trees growing up towards the light. In front of them stands a statue called Young Man with Bound Hands. His slim figure exudes calm determination. He seems to be taking a step forward, head held high, towards his ""final journey"".  

The Memorial Centre 

The Memorial Centre commemorates different facets of the resistance against the National Socialist dictatorship and includes biographical information, political motives and the struggles of the various resistance groups. Alongside Stauffenberg, the exhibition commemorates everyone who opposed Hitler. The Memorial Centre is one of the main memorials to the revolt of conscience against the criminal regime of the National Socialists.  

It also remembers the struggles of the White Rose resistance movement, the communist and church resistance groups and the Edelweiss Pirates against the dictatorship of the National Socialists. Another Memorial commemorates the Silent Heroes - people who risked their lives to help persecuted Jews during the Nazi dictatorship.

",,,"Communists kidnap radio announcer
The evening of 6 October 1928. Wolfgang Schwarz, a Social Democrat politician, is waiting for a car to take him to Voxhaus, Germany's first radio broadcaster. Schwarz is to give a talk on the problem of securing peace in Europe. The car arrives with three men in it, all claiming to be radio technicians. After a while, Schwarz realises they are not heading for Voxhaus in Potsdamer Straße. When he tries to raise the alarm, they threaten him with guns.

Meanwhile, Karl Schulz, a Communist member of the Prussian parliament, arrives in the Voxhaus broadcasting studio. He says he is Wolfgang Schwarz. When he goes on air, he begins by reading a few lines from the talk as announced. Suddenly, he changes the cadence of his voice - and the content of the speech. He forcefully argues for supporting the Communist party referendum to prevent German naval rearmament.

Germany's first radio broadcasts from Voxhaus

On 29 October 1923, the Berlin Funkstunde goes on air - the first German radio programme. It broadcasts from simple sound studios in the attic of the Voxhaus building, once on the Alte Potsdamer Straße close to today's entrance to the Panoramapunkt viewing platform in the Kollhoff Tower. The Funkstunde broadcaster sets out to entertain and educate in equal measure. In the 1920s, fierce debates rage over how much of the daily programme should be devoted to political developments. Initially, the government tries to restrict political discussion on news broadcasters, and so Wolfgang Schwarz's talk is censored in advance.

Banditry, fraud or a legitimate political weapon?

Many newspapers treat the kidnapping and fake lecture as a cheap trick - but the background is a serious political conflict over Germany's rearmament. The opposition SPD social democrat party first rejects the funding for new armoured cruisers for the navy. After elections in spring 1928, things change. The SPD are clear winners and can nominate their candidate as chancellor - but rely on coalition support from the conservatives. So, the SPD changes tack in cabinet and supports building the armoured cruisers. The change of heart leads to bitter exchanges in the SPD, and further fuels the heated dispute between the SPD and the Communist party. The Communists call for a referendum against constructing the cruisers - and their audacious broadcasting adventure is a vain attempt to mobilise the masses for their cause.

After the broadcast finishes, the car leaves Wolfgang Schwarz on a country road outside Berlin. Over the following weeks, all three kidnappers are apprehended and charged with coercion and unlawful detention. They show no remorse for their actions. They assure the court that Wolfgang Schwarz was never in serious danger. Two of the guns were toys, the other was genuine but not loaded.

The entire affair is also embarrassing for the Funkstunde studios. No one there ever notices the talk is different from the manuscript. Afterwards, the broadcaster even insists on paying the agreed fee - but the fake speaker refuses to accept it.
",,"When broadcasters take to the airwaves, radio enjoys an unprecedented boom. By late 1924, official statistics show 555,000 radio listeners in Germany, with 220,000 of them in Berlin. By the end of 1925, that figure jumps to over one million. By December 1929, it reaches three million, not even counting listeners who dodge radio licensing fees.

",,,"Life in “Charlottengrad”
Today, Goltzstraße in Schöneberg is lined with cafes, restaurants and boutiques. But in December 1921, journalist Moritz Goldstein describes the area as bleak, unattractive and ""absent of poetry"". Except for the backyard of number 9-10. Today it's a grey post-war building, but back then it housed a ""delightful little theatre"". It was the first home of a Russian/German theatre called Der blaue Vogel &not;- The Blue Bird.

In the early 1920s there were so many Russian émigrés living in Berlin that Charlottenburg became known as ""Charlottengrad"". They had fled their home country to escape the Bolshevik revolution and the turmoil of civil war. The refugees included many artists and intellectuals who were hoping to put down roots in the cities of Western Europe. They brought the tradition of Russian cabaret to Berlin. 

The glorious colours of the Blue Bird 

The theatre is housed in a converted backyard cinema. It has two tiers of seats but is small and intimate. As soon as you step inside, you're assailed by its brightly coloured interior - blue velvet on the walls, a green ceiling, pink stucco ornamentation and yellow lampshades. The stage curtain is adorned with an abstract image of a blue bird hovering over a stylised flower meadow. 

Yakov Yuzhny acts as compere, introducing the cabaret acts in his broken German. Kurt Tucholsky describes him as follows: ""He looks like a very clever, long-legged bird. He has dangerously clever, dark eyes and a penetrating voice. He makes a delightful noise that sounds a little like German. He is always in control, and has such wit, tact, delicacy and taste!"" 

It's not only Tucholsky and Goldstein who are spellbound by the Blue Bird. Berlin's audiences are thrilled by the new, surprising mix of vibrant stage sets, acting, music, song and dance. There's no politics and no dirty jokes. Instead, they are treated to a fascinating blend of Russian folklore, modern art and European theatre traditions. 

The programme is extremely eclectic. A scene with Russian workers' songs might be followed by traditional folklore, a Spanish dance, a parody of Americanism or a tragic fairy tale set in a French royal palace. It's a mixture of the grotesque, satirical, nostalgic, melodramatic and joyful. The audience seems to find it enchanting, wonderful, entertaining, tasteful and beautiful.  

The Blue Bird takes flight 

Like many of the refugees, this Russian/German theatre is only a temporary visitor to Berlin. After around two years it sets off on a tour of Europe and North America, but always comes back to Berlin. For Russian émigré and theatre director Yakov Yuzhny, the Blue Bird is a blessing. He describes himself as a phoenix who ""died in Moscow in 1920"" and was ""reborn in Berlin in 1921"". 
",,"There are other attempts to set up similar cabaret theatres elsewhere in Berlin. But none are as successful as the theatre in Goltzstraße. They are colourless or, in Alfred Polgar's words, ""grey birds"".

The Zionskirche is packed to the rafters. People are crowding around the pulpit and hanging off the cross. It's 17 October 1987, just after 10pm. 2,000 East Germans have flooded into the church to see a concert by the West Berlin band Element of Crime. As the boom of the bass speakers fades away, the church is stormed - and becomes a battlefield.

A hub of resistance 

The church in Berlin-Mitte has a chequered history. Pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer worked here during the Second World War. As part of the church opposition movement, he was an active member of the resistance against the Nazi regime. He was executed in the Flossenbürg concentration camp in 1945. On the west side of the church you can see a bronze memorial to this resistance fighter.  

Later on, when Germany is divided into East and West, the Zionskirche is still a meeting place for opposition groups. In 1986, parish priest Hans Simon allows the ""Umweltbibliothek"" (Environmental Library) to be set up in the basement of the parish hall. The library contains banned books and magazines on environmental and human rights topics. Opposition groups also hold meetings in the basement. Of course, the East German regime is not happy about the meetings of the Zion Church Peace and Environmental Circle. 

Then, in October 1987, there's the concert by Element of Crime. The band's singer Sven Regener describes his impressions on entering East Berlin: ""It's like a parallel universe just around the corner (...) like another version of West Berlin. Bizarre."" Regener also says he expected the East Berlin police to turn up. But it's not the Stasi who storm the Zionskirche.  

Skinhead attack and Stasi raid 

It's actually violent neo-Nazis who attack the concert-goers. Many are seriously injured, but the police simply stand and watch. East Germany's Socialist Unity Party plays down the attack at first, but when news of the incident spreads throughout Germany, it has to admit that the GDR has a problem with neo-Nazis.  

Less than a month after the skinhead attack, the church is the target of a Stasi raid. On the night of 24-25 November 1987, they storm the Environmental Library and arrest its members. The raid triggers nationwide protests and demonstrations of support. The GDR regime has no choice but to release the prisoners and tolerate the presence of the library.  

After German reunification in 1990, work begins on restoring the church, which was badly damaged during the Second World War. Historian Dirk Moldt, one of the organisers of the Element of Crime concert, expresses his hope that the church won't be given ""too much of a makeover"". The scars of history should not be covered over.

",,,"Artistic freedom in East and West
Artists in East and West Berlin do all they can to create the conditions they need to live and work. Spying, philistinism, lack of money - nothing deflects them from fighting for their freedoms.

When the artists' club Die Möwe [The Seagull] opens on 15 June 1946, Berlin suddenly has a major new attraction - and free thinkers once again have a place to let their hair down after the end of the war. Actor, singer and activist Ernst Busch is instrumental in persuading the Soviet military administration to allow the theatre and film club to open in the east of the city. The building in Luisenstraße 18 quickly becomes something of a legend. 

It is a magnet for celebrities, with guests including Bertolt Brecht, Erich Kästner, Yves Montand, Helene Weigel, Carl Zuckmayr, Simone de Beauvoir and Sophia Loren. 

The Seagull flies free  

But the real attraction of the club, named after Anton Chekhov's famous play, is not the star-studded guest list, but the fact that it provides a sense of freedom. The lucky ones who are granted entry find an escape from their everyday lives. Thanks to their good connections to the Soviet administration, the German artists can get hold of special rations, even during the lean post-war years. Looking back, actor Peter Sodann comments: ""Boy, did I get plenty to eat there!"". 

Before the Fall of the Wall, artists from East and West Berlin flock to The Seagull to party. Dissidents, philosophers and Stasi informers all come together under one roof - that's how journalist Jutta Voigt remembers it: ""The Seagull shone like a star in the darkness. Once you were allowed in, you felt uplifted, like you had ascended to a cosmopolitan heaven. One night, French fries were served at the bar and for a moment you felt like you were in Paris."" 

But its glamour fails to survive reunification. In 1990 the club closes due to lack of funds, and even an attempt to re-open it is unsuccessful. Luisenstraße 18 is now occupied by the Berlin Representation of Saxony-Anhalt.  

New Wild Ones in the old West  

It's 1975, and the West has a new, exciting hotspot: the artists Salomé and Rainer Fetting have moved into an old factory building on Moritzplatz. There they create their own particular brand of art using broad brushes and expressionist radicalism in an area that is considered to be the end of the world: nothing but walls, industrial yards and decay.  

""Fuck"" is the name of a cycle produced by Solomé during this period: naked men's bodies, sensual motifs. Things that are taboo in bourgeois post-war Germany are given free rein in Oranienstraße 58. In 1977 they join forces with other artist friends to set up the Galerie am Moritzplatz in another old factory and gain international fame as the New Wild Ones. 

After some lean early years, the breakthrough finally comes. Salomé's paintings hang in the Museum of Modern Art in New York, art dealers buy up everything the studio produces. Years later, Salomé purchases the building at 58 Oranienstraße for himself and lives and works there to this day - even though the gallery has been closed since 1981.
",,"During The Seagull's heyday, actor Jaecki Schwarz - who later becomes famous in the TV series Polizeiruf - is one of the regulars at the legendary artists' club. ""I must have spent thousands of marks there"", he recalls. ""I was a regular visitor for almost forty years.""

",,,"Manhattan comes to Hermannplatz
A horse in a department store? It sounds like a scene from the Wild West - but it's actually an advertising campaign. In early June 1930, the Rudolph Karstadt company allows circus rider Cilly Feindt to ride her horse up the escalators to demonstrate how easy it is for shoppers to access the giant new department store on Hermannplatz. It seems that Germany's largest department store chain is also looking to America for inspiration for its advertising.

Europe's most modern department store 

You're standing in front of the remaining façade of the original Karstadt building. Let's go back to 21 June 1929. A huge crowd has gathered to witness the opening of the nation's largest temple to consumerism. The gigantic building has broken all records. The stone colossus contains more retail space on its seven floors than KaDeWe. It also has three atriums, its own bathing pool and several restaurants. A direct subway connection, 24 escalators and 24 lifts channel the masses into the store and around its sales floors. 4,000 staff are there to meet their customers' every need.  

The Berlin newspapers are impressed by the new ""American-style mammoth department store""  and celebrate Berlin's ""latest skyscraper""  as ""a new landmark for the growing, aspiring metropolis"".  The spectacularly-lit building is a sight to behold at night too. The columns of lights on the 56-metre-high corner towers even help to guide pilots as they approach Tempelhof Airport.    

This magnificent shoppers' paradise on the edge of the working-class districts of Kreuzberg and Neukölln quickly becomes a go-to place for Berlin's urbanites. Karstadt brings in the customers with a string of new attractions - buy a build-your-own glider kit, attend readings by famous writers such as Erich Kästner and Heinrich Mann, or record your own voice onto disc using a Phonotone device. In the afternoons, the huge roof garden is the perfect place to enjoy coffee and cake with panoramic views over the city or dance to the sounds of live bands. Karstadt's own song, specially composed for the store opening, is a big hit - and of course you can buy it as a 78 record.  

Consumer palace in crisis 

But the dream of boundless consumerism is soon shattered when the global economy collapses after Wall Street's Black Friday. The rapid decline in Karstadt's bulk purchasing power pushes its balance sheet into the red. The group responds with mass layoffs and cost-cutting measures. By 1932, only 1,000 staff are still employed at the Hermannplatz store and two entire sales floors stand empty. Driven by hunger, people are stealing food from the ""land of milk and honey""  that is the food department. Desperate people are leaping to their deaths from the roof garden.  

In March 1933, under pressure from the Nazis, Karstadt dismisses most of its Jewish staff. The building is destroyed in the last days of the Second World War, and Karstadt starts rebuilding its former flagship store in 1950. But today's building is barely half the size of the original and provides few reminders of the glitz and glamour of the Roaring Twenties.

Pop icon Madonna - a guest director at this year's Berlin International Film Festival - has chosen to celebrate her film's premiere at Kaffee Burger on Torstraße.

A meeting place for non-conformists 

Kaffee Burger has cult status - and a fascinating history. The Burger, as it's known, is more than just a café and bar. It's a regular haunt of dissidents. It's where artists and creatives gather to chew the fat. There's been a pub on this spot since the late 19th century. The Burger family took it over in 1936 and put their name on the outside of the building. They and their guests are destined to live through turbulent times, including two dictatorships.  

Under the GDR regime, Kaffee Burger is a hotspot of East Berlin's cultural scene. It's close to the Volksbühne, the hub of contemporary theatre. Regular visitors to the bar include the writer Thomas Brasch, playwright Heiner Müller, actress Katharina Thalbach and songwriter Bettina Wegner, along with countless other free-thinking GDR citizens and people who are keen to leave the country. Of course the Stasi are not too happy about this. It thinks East Berlin's bohemian crowd are enjoying too much freedom, so it moves into the building's empty first floor to keep a close eye on the Burger family and their guests.  

From cafe to disco 

Kaffee Burger survives the upheavals of German reunification and it's business as usual. The Burgers finally decide to retire in 1999.

"Arnulfstraße, Tempelhof",52.457278,13.361139,History,1,FALSE,Lindenhof residential development,"A breath of fresh air - Berlin's green oasis
",,,"A green oasis in the heart of the city
""When you look around you, why would you want to leave?""  Gerd Reimer, a resident of the Lindenhof development, asks this question during an interview in April 2012. He is battling serious illness and dies shortly afterwards. He lived his whole life in the Lindenhof, a place that his family has called home for four generations. His great-grandmother, grandmother and parents all lived in this residential development in the southernmost corner of Berlin's Schöneberg district. And when you look around this oasis in the heart of the city, you have to agree with Gerd Reimer - it's a very special place. 

The story begins in 1918 when Martin Wagner, architect and head of urban planning for Schöneberg, conceives and plans the redevelopment of this former pioneer settlement into a garden city. The idea is to create a residential development that provides ample green spaces, community facilities, affordable housing and the potential for self-sufficiency. In short: a breath of fresh air in the heart of the city. 

Under Wagner's supervision, an oasis is created in Schöneberg, with park-like green spaces, ponds dating back to the Ice Age, a patch of woodland and houses with gardens. The development's architecture has a special feature: doors, windows and gateways with pointed arches. As you admire the old trees that still stand here today, you can feel how the Berliners must have breathed a sigh of relief when they moved here in the 1920s. 

After its completion in 1920, the new residential development is taken over by what is now the GeWoSüd housing cooperative. Around 80% of the buildings were destroyed during the Second World War. The reconstructions you see here today are a mix of 20th-century architectural styles, including row-house apartment blocks from the 1950s, multi-storey residential buildings and tower blocks from the 1960s and 1970s, and a relatively new semicircular building from 1990, built on the last remaining vacant plot. 

The rebuilding of the Lindenhof residential development was close to Gerd Reimer's heart.  From a young age, he was committed to the idea of cooperative living, and it is something today's residents are still keen to preserve. They tend their gardens, keep bees, come together for brunches and sports activities in a self-determined, tolerant and open community. Lindenhof resident Ute Sperling says: ""For me, cooperative living is synonymous with community, the common good, common interests and a common residential area."" 

Lindenhof is still something of a pioneering settlement. A new energy concept introduced in 2009 has drastically reduced its carbon footprint, tree sponsorship schemes have been set up, new maisonette-type apartments are being built and extensive renovation work is steaming ahead. GeWoSüd has received several awards for its Lindenhof - Traditionally Modern concept. 

Today, some 2,500 people live in the Lindenhof development. Many people are impressed by its green concept and would love to join the cooperative, while others - like Gerd Reimer - have lived here for generations and can't imagine leaving their green oasis in the heart of the city.

",,,"The night the Wall falls and the bridge to freedom
Build in 1916, the Bösebrücke steel bridge had seen a lot - thousands walking, riding or driving across it. But it never experienced anything like the vast crowd gathering on its eastern side on 9 November 1989.

At that time, the border dividing Germany runs across the centre of the bridge. In the border crossing point at East Berlin's Bornholmer Straße, Lieutenant Colonel Harald Jäger is keeping the situation under observation. Events are moving fast. When he takes a break, he watches TV. Just like thousands of others, he hears of a new travel ruling for East German citizens. They will be allowed to cross freely to the West, effective as of now. Freely crossing to the West? But that means they'll come to his crossing point too! 

The times are pointing to freedom  

As the passport unit's officer of the day, Harald Jäger contacts his superior officer. The response is total disbelief. Jäger's superior has heard nothing about a new ruling on crossing to the West, and thinks Jäger is exaggerating about crowds at Bornholmer Straße. But outside people are already pushing forwards chanting ""Open the gate"". Inside the crossing point, the air of insecurity is palpable. Lieutenant Colonel Jäger knows he has to act. After all, with the crowd waiting to cross to the West constantly growing, it would only take a spark to cause a riot. At last, Harald Jäger manages to reach the responsible authority. He is given permission for an emergency solution. Known as the ""safety valve regulation"", this allows those shouting loudest to cross.  

Let the troublemakers go  

Anyone aggressively demanding to cross to the West is allowed through. They have a stamp put in their passport, just covering their photo. But they don't realise this stamp is an identification, so when they want to return to East Germany, they will be stopped at the border. Even if they knew, it wouldn't change anything. As far as they are concerned, ""The main thing is to cross to the West!"" The pressure keeps building. Evermore people are arriving on foot and in their Trabi cars. Harald Jäger knows that if a panic starts, everyone would suffer. So around 11.30 pm he decides against the regime, and for a peaceful solution. He lifts the checkpoint barrier, and a flood of cheering people stream over the Bösebrücke to the West. The border is open! 

Today, the square in front of the former crossing point is called Platz des 9. November 1989. There, you can find an open-air exhibition commemorating the over 20,000 people who crossed the border in the first hours, as well as the later fall of the Berlin Wall. The square is just a short walk to the other side of the Bösebrücke bridge - once the site of the East German border crossing point.
",,"The bridge is named after Wilhelm Böse, and no doubt he would have been pleased with the peaceful fall of the border. During the Nazi period, Böse worked against the Nazis and supported demands for their opponents to be released. Imprisoned several times, he was sentenced to death in 1944.

",,,"The Day of Liberation
Karlshorst, a district in the south-east of Berlin, is well away from the bustling inner city. Here, social housing estates from the 1920s and 1930s rub shoulders with elaborate mansions and apartment blocks from the early years of Imperial Germany. This is the kind of solidly respectable district where no momentous events disturb the passage of time. And yet Karlshorst made a big splash in world history. You are now standing outside the former Wehrmacht officers' mess. Here, at the end of the Second World War, the High Command of the German armed forces meet General Zhukov, commander-in-chief of the Soviet army that took Berlin.

8 May 1945. Hitler is dead. The Soviet flag is flying over the Reichstag. Nazi Germany has been driven from the stage of world history for good. The country has unconditionally surrendered. But Germany's official capitulation still needs the signature of the commander-in-chief of the Wehrmacht - the German armed forces. 

And where should this highly symbolic act take place? The Soviet forces look for a central location in Berlin, Hitler's planned world capital. But the city is in ruins, and so are most official buildings. Finally, they find a former officers' mess in Karlshorst in the city suburbs - not the central location they wanted, but the building is still intact. Here on the evening of 8 May, representatives of the victorious Red Army meet the defeated generals of the German Wehrmacht.  

Just a few hours before... 

Colonel General Alfred Jodl, Wehrmacht Chief of Operations Staff, is hundreds of kilometres away in the French city of Reims. At 2.41 am in the early hours of 7 May 1945, Jodl signs the unconditional surrender of all German armed forces. Not without a little pathos, he expresses the hope that the ""victor will treat them with generosity"". ""The German people and armed forces,"" he continues, ""are now, for better or worse, delivered into the victor's hands."" 

The Soviet leadership feels robbed of its moment of glory. It insists on ratifying the capitulation already signed in Reims. And so Karlshorst in the south-east of Berlin has its moment of fame. On 9 May at around quarter past midnight central European summer time, the cameras click and cine cameras whir to capture world history in the making. In Berlin's Karlshorst district. 

The signature ending the war in Europe 

Shortly before midnight. General Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, then the highest ranking active soldier in the Wehrmacht, enters the packed room. Representatives of all four victorious Allies are present. Film cameras are on hand to capture the moment. General Field Marshal Keitel looks briefly at General Zhukov, Soviet commander-in-chief, and hesitates, as if he expects Zhukov to stand up. Zhukov remains seated. Keitel raises his Field Marshal's staff to acknowledge him, and sits down. After just a few moments, Keitel signs the ratified terms of unconditional surrender. Later, Zhukov recalled the moments after the ceremony: ""Everyone was congratulating one other and shaking hands. Many had tears of joy in their eyes."" 

The world heaved a sigh of relief. The Second World War in Europe is finally over.  This historical location has been a museum since 1967. Every year in the socialist GDR, the divided section of eastern Germany, the Day of Liberation by the Red Army was celebrated in the ""Museum of the Unconditional Surrender of Fascist Germany in the Great Patriotic War"".

",,,"We make our own decisions!
Benjamin Bilse is a talented conductor. But he's also a little tight-fisted, and when he decides to cut his musicians' already modest wages and make them travel by train to a concert in fourth class, it's the final straw. Today, the Berliner Philharmoniker is one of the world's top orchestras, but it started out as a rebellion.

50 of the 56 musicians refuse to sign Bilse's new contract. They decide it's better to go freelance than let the popular maestro treat them like day labourers. On 1 May 1882 they sign a notarised agreement binding the members of the new ensemble to ""mutual steadfast solidarity"".  Now all the musicians will play at their own risk. Now it is up to them who joins the orchestra and what works to perform. And they will elect their principal conductor by secret ballot - as they still do to this day.  

A roller skating rink becomes a temple of the Muses 

The orchestra now calls itself the Former Bilse's Ensemble. But it's not all plain sailing, and there are times when the ensemble led by conductor Ludwig von Brenner comes close to splitting up. The first concert by the now independent ensemble is put on at the Sing-Akademie. In the summer of 1882 they find a more suitable venue: the Central Skating Rink here in Bernburger Straße. You are standing in front of what is left of this building. Go through the old archway into the courtyard. You will see a plaque commemorating the fact that this legendary venue was once used by the Berlin Philharmonic. The building has a stage and its own restaurant. On 17 October 1882, the musicians perform for the first time as the Philharmonic Orchestra at the behest of concert agent Hermann Wolff, while the audience happily munches and slurps away. 

The Philharmonic becomes a world-renowned orchestra 

In 1887, Hans von Bülow, a progressive and uncompromising conductor, takes over at the Berlin Philharmonic. He whips his musicians into shape with endless rehearsals, turning them into a world-class orchestra. Meanwhile, the architect Franz Schwechten is rebuilding the old roller skating rink. The stage that was originally off to one side is moved to the end, and the panelled ceiling is raised and decorated with sound-absorbing plaster. Stucco medallions and portraits of composers adorn the walls. The auditorium can now seat 2,500 people. With an optimum reverberation time of two seconds, the Philharmonie's acoustics are outstanding. 

Many of the world's leading musicians play here in Bernburger Strasse, until the Philharmonie is razed to the ground by an aerial bombing raid during the Second World War. On 15 October 1963 the Berlin Philharmonic moves into a new home in the Kulturforum Berlin. But the musicians still enjoy more freedom than any other orchestra in the world.

There's a smell of freshly baked bread... No, Asian spices - or somehow of South America? All your senses come alive when you step into the Markthalle. It's packed with incredible sights and sounds, but above all with irresistible tastes and aromas. The perfect place to make tofu!

Historic Markthalle Neun opened its doors in 1891, but after many years of being used by discounters it was only truly brought back to life in October 2011.  

Step inside and you'll find the TofuTussis, two young women who produce the kind of fresh tofu that even non-vegetarians fall in love with. In the Markthalle, the duo have found the perfect place to make and sell their soy-based products. They make all of their own products down in the cellar - curry-mango tofu, algae-smoked tofu, soya burgers, kimchi and other unusual vegetarian ideas.  

The TofuTussis experiment with German soybeans, grinding them up to produce a milky liquid, then adding herbs and spices and turning them into tofu. But of course, the market offers more than just soya products. At Kumpel & Keule, one of the market hall's very first vendors, you can watch the butchers at work behind the glass storefront. The Markthalle also puts on cookery courses, concerts and specific food-related events such as the Sunday Breakfast Market and Street Food Thursday. 

A walk through food history  

Take a stroll through the 250 stalls on a Friday or Saturday and you'll have a chance to sample ancient varieties of fruit and vegetables from local producers. And you'll discover how salt marsh mountain cheese is rinsed with white wine. The TofuTussis also see themselves as pioneers, breaking down people's prejudices against the soy-based product. You say it tastes like nothing? Hang on, maybe you've never actually eaten fresh tofu? Here, try this. See! It's really nice! And they've made another convert.  

The idea behind TofuTussis is simple yet brilliant. When people know how much effort and love goes into their food, they once again start to appreciate and respect quality produce and artisanship. It's also a chance to bring food production back into the city, says Elena Grimm, one of the TofuTussis. With their relatively small budget, they would have struggled to open elsewhere in Berlin. They are happy to be a part of the Markthalle and love the interaction with other vendors, producers and customers. The Markthalle has once again become a meeting place - just like in 1891.

",,,"A library is donated and becomes a symbol of freedom
In the early 1950s, a German academic travels to the United States on an unusual mission. Dr Fritz Moser is keen to learn more about its public libraries, which are considered a cornerstone of American democracy. Back in Berlin, he puts into practice what he has learned. The Amerika-Gedenkbibliothek (American Memorial Library) is destined to become a beacon of intellectual freedom on the River Spree.

Just a few years earlier, Moser could only dream of a making this kind of overseas research trip. The Nazis banned the philosopher from putting pen to paper. However, in 1946, the Greater Berlin authorities put him in charge of the Department of National Education - partly because he remained untainted by the Nazis. Suddenly Fritz Moser was in a position to shape his city's cultural future.  

A new kind of library   

The writer seizes the opportunity and submits a proposal to Mayor Ernst Reuter for a new library building based on the Anglo-Saxon model. A donation from the American government turns the concept into reality.  At the laying of the foundation stone in 1952, US Secretary of State Dean Acheson explains why his country has provided funding for the library: ""It is the freedom to learn, to study, to seek the truth."" The most modern library in Europe opens two years later - and its director is Fritz Moser.  

The people of Berlin are amazed by this gift from their liberators because the twelve-storey building is so different from the libraries they are used to. In the past they had to ask for a particular book title at the counter, but now they can simply wander through the shelves and select their own books. Librarians no longer have power over the knowledge they disseminate. Now they are just there to administer and advise.  

Years of oppression and Nazi censorship have left people thirsting for knowledge, and the new library is a huge hit from day one. The number of books and borrowers increases steadily as the years go by, and today the library has around 3,500 visitors a day. 

""Girls in headscarves and Kreuzberg punks""  

On the occasion of the library's 60th anniversary, Berlin's former State Secretary of Culture, André Schmitz, sums up what the library is all about: ""At the American Memorial Library you'll find girls in headscarves and Kreuzberg punks, the Berlin Philharmonic getting its sheet music, fans selecting from a huge range of international films (...) In Germany's largest children's library, kids can find cosy corners to read in, while parents can get advice on the best books for their children."" 

Fritz Moser remains the library's director until he retires in 1973. You can find out more about the ideals that spurred him on at the entrance to the library. Carved in stone, they begin with the words: ""This foundation is based on the boundless freedom of the human mind.""
",,"In Berlin it is rumoured that the word America was removed from the library's name on the roof for political reasons. In fact, it was never officially part of the sign, but in 2016 the artists Nina Fischer and Maroan el Sani temporarily added it as a way of playing with the viewer's perceptions and their image of America.

Albert Speer, 1972
As the Reich Minister for Armaments and Munitions, who organised the “total war”, and participated in the forced labourers programme here, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison at Nuremberg. Albert Speer became famous, however, as “Adolf Hitler’s architect"" - and as one of the most dazzling personalities of the Third Reich. He actually built comparatively little in this time and even less of this has been preserved in Berlin itself, apart from his rather unspectacular residential house in Kronprinzessinnenstraße, there are only fragments such as the candelabra on Straße des 17. Juni and the redesigned Große Stern, the Great Star with the slightly higher Victory Column.
Albert Speer was born into an upper middle class family of architects in Mannheim. After his architectural studies in Karlsruhe, he became assistant to Heinrich Tessenow, a moderate representative of modernism whose architecture fallowed the criteria of simplicity, expedience and practicality, in 1928 in Berlin. In hint, Speer found his ""first catalyst"".
He met his “second catalyst"", Adolf Hitler, in December 1930 at his speech to students in Hasenheide in Berlin. One month later, Speer Joined the Nazi party; the following year he took part in the election campaign. The party rewarded him for this with building commissions: before the assumption of power, he was allowed to rebuild two Berlin offices, later the bureaus of the Propaganda Minister and the Reich Chancellor. As “designer"" of the May celebrations, the radio exhibition in Berlin and the Nuremberg Rally, he became known to Hitler again in 1933.
A close relationship developed: for Hitler, Speer was the architect he had always wanted to be. It was only in discussions with him that the dictator, who was otherwise rather inhibited with his feelings, was relaxed, even laid back; he even tolerated being contradicted. Conversely, Speer endeavoured to accommodate the taste of the “Führer”. At the Nuremberg Rally site, he managed a synthesis between the Classicism favoured by Hitler and the practicality of Tessenow: a facility of gigantic dimensions smothering the individual; the grand stand alone was to hold 60,000 people. Speer was clearly fashionable: at the Paris World Fair in 1937, he was awarded the Grand Prix.
To give his position as almighty “Führer” the appropriate backdrop, Hitler commissioned Speer with the construction of the Neue Reichskanzlei on Voßstraße (no. 248), which was deliberately conceived to intimidate foreign guests of state. The excessively long approach, which diplomats and guests of state had to make to the reception hall, did not fail in its effect. One of the first to realise this was the Czechoslovakian state president Emil Flacha, who, worn down by a nocturnal terror meeting and a heart attack, signed the consent for the occupation of his country by the Germans here in March 1939.
Speer’s sphere of influence had expanded by 1937: Hitler appointed him “General Building Inspector for the Redesign of the Reich Capital”. His responsibility was to rebuild Berlin into a 10 million metropolis “Germania"" by 1950 (see no. 224).
In 1942, Speer was appointed Minister of Armaments. He energetically cranked up the war economy, which was essentially based on the employment of forced labourers and prisoners from concentration camps, and worked together with Heinrich Himmler and the SS to this end. Here, he clearly gave hardly any thought to the more far reaching consequences of his actions.
Unlike the other main players, Speer, at the Nuremberg trials, did not insist he was merely obeying orders. Instead, he assumed responsibility for the commands he had carried out. What he denied, even after his release in 1966 and until the end, was any knowledge of the mass shootings and extermination camps.",,,National Socialism: 1933-1945,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,

The original plan was for the structure to house an auditorium and lecture rooms for the university. During the construction period, the intended purpose of the building was altered.

It was here that Schlüter learned the functions of a construction site, under the leadership of the court artist Tilman van Gameren. It appears that his work in Poland was not yet that of an architect. In 1694, the Brandenburg Elector Friedrich III, later King Friedrich I, in Prussia, called him to Berlin to work as a sculptor. There was no mention of architecture at this point, with Johann Arnold Nering in charge of the construction matters of the city at that time. On his return from a study trip in 1696, Schlüter was commissioned with the design of keystones on the windows and doors of the Zeughaus (no. 16), which had been designed by Nering. In addition, he also received a commission for a bronze rider statue of the Great Elector, which was to become his greatest work as a sculptor. It was created for a prominent location on the Lange Briicke between Schlossplatz and the present day Nikoiai-viertel (no. 362). Today it stands in the forecourt of Schioss Charlottenburg (no. 19), with a copy in the cupola hall of the Bodemuseum (no. 131).
In 1698, Schlüter succeeded Nering as architect for the construction of the Zeughaus. He also created the famous masks of the dying warriors in the courtyard, together with the trophies on the roof balustrade. In the same year, he was assigned with the task of converting the Elector’s Renaissance castle on the Spree Island into a royal palace. Friedrich I appointed him director of castle construction for this purpose. The castle (no. 7), with the Schlüterhof that was later named after him, is his chief work. It was damaged in the war and demolished in 1950 on the orders of Walter Ulbricht. The Staats-ratsgebaude of 1964 (no. 308), erected on Schlossplatz by the GDR government, incorporated a portal of the castle with sculpted ornamentation in the facade.
Schlüter fell from favour after the Minzturm (no. 17) that he had designed on the northwest corner of the castle collapsed. It was to have been the royal trademark of the royal residence. In 1704, two thirds of the construction were already completed when the tower began to tilt, threatening to collapse. Schlüter attempted to save the tower with the addition of supports and iron rings, covered by a second, more complex design. Despite these efforts, in 1706, he was forced to preempt the threatened collapse by demolishing part of the tower. He was released from the service of the court in 1707. Schlüter never really recovered from this ignominy. The misfortune not
only affected his artistic pride; it also pulled him down into a severe nervous crisis. To the King he remained a bad memory: “Schlüter, the rogue who built the tower so rottenly”.
In 1710, Schliiter left the Akademie der Wissenschaften, the academy of sciences in Berlin. His final building in Berlin was the Landhaus Kameke, built in 1711 -12. It was damaged in the Second World War and later demolished (see no. 21).
Following the death of Friedrich 1, whose ornate tin coffin Schlüter had modeled and prepared for casting, Schlüter left Berlin in 1713, heading for St. Petersburg, where he pitched himself headlong into his work. He died one year after his arrival, before he was able to begin the implementation of his grandiose plans. The exact date of his death (like that of his birth) is unknown; no authentic image of him exists. Only Schlüter’s sculptures remain, telling the tale of the genius of this extraordinary artist to the present day.",,,Baroque: 1600-1790,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,

", Berlin",52.5200066,13.404954,Architecture,3,FALSE,Berlin Stadtschloss,,Architect: Unkown,1450-1850,"Is there any other city in the civilised world with such a gaping void at its centre as Berlin? Where the main axes of the city floor plan converge in a giant, dull car park with a multipurpose building? Here, on the Spree Island, the Stadtschloss stood for 500 years. Despite surviving the war with only minor damage, it was demolished in 1950 on the orders of Walter Ulbricht, who saw the building as a symbol of Prussian militarism, and wished to create an area for mass parades on the spot. The sole surviving part of the castle was Portal IV of the Lustgarten front, integrated into the facade of the Staatsratsgebaude (no. 308) in 1964 - partially in the form of a copy. The GDR considered it to be worthy of saving due to the fact that Karl Liebknecht declared the Socialist Republic from here in 1918. The location of other fragments of the historic facades and the rubble from the demolition remains unclear to this day. Much of it is located in museums and depots, with other sections thought to be in undeveloped rubble tips around the city.
This was the end of a significant monument, one that represented the overall development of Prussian architecture like no other. Begun around 1450, it was continually extended and amended by the master builders of the time. The Baroque facade of Andreas Schliiter (no. 18) was created around 1700, based upon the Palazzo Madama in Rome. With the dome of Friedrich August Stiller, the castle received its final external appearance in 1850. The most famous part of the grounds was the easternmost of the two interior courtyards, named Schluterhof in honour of its creator.
The overwhelming significance of the Stadtschloss for Berlin lay in its urban planning function. The entire westward expansion of the city hinged upon the position and architecture of this colossus, with neighbouring structures such as the Baroque Zeughaus (no. 16), the Altes Museum (no. 62) and the Bauakademie (no. 65) by Karl Friedrich Schinkel designed for their relation to the castle. The Lustgarten frontage once formed the vanishing point of the boulevard Unter den Linden, which today merely runs into empty space.
The staging of the castle backdrop in summer 1993, a private initiative on the part of the Hamburg businessman Wilhelm von Boddien, provided an impressive insight into how the powerful bulk of the castle would reunite the disparate structures at the centre of the city. Even opponents of reconstruction found themselves swayed by this argument. After years of intense public discussion and interim use, the Palast der Republik (no. 337), built by the GDR government, was demolished between December 2006 and December 2008. In
When built in 1891, this was one of the biggest wells in the world: the Neptune Fountain on Schlossplatz. (Photograph from pre-war times)
October 2008, the ""Temporary Kunsthalle Berlin” was erected on the castle grounds. Also following intense public discourse, the Bundestag and the state of Berlin decided in 2007 to rebuild the Stadtschloss with historic facades. The cornerstone was laid in 2013, headed by architect Franco Stella. His plan provides scope for the reconstruction of three Baroque facades as well as an additional building on the eastern side of the Stadtschloss.

"Friedrichswerder, Berlin",52.5145737,13.3988008,Architecture,3,FALSE,Berlin's Inner-City Plan: Strategy for the Coming Decades,,,,"In November 1996, the Senate of Berlin presented an extensive plan for the centre of Berlin under the title “Planwerk Innenstadt Berlin”, Berlin’s inner-city plan. Deliberately, the first presentation was made in the framework of the Stadtforum as a prelude for a “dialogic” urban renewal. In open discussion, the preliminary plans for both the teams of Manfred Ortner/Fritz Neumeyer (City West) and Bernd Albers/Dieter Hoff-mann-Axthelm (historical centre) were debated in more than 30 planning workshops and 20 public Stadtforum discussions until May 1999, when the Senate’s plans were agreed as the binding central theme for the coming 30 years, and the requirements were adapted to the people concerned. Hans Stimmann (no. 404) is the spiritual father of the Planwerk Innenstadt. At this time, he was acting in the function as state secretary for urban development management.
The Berlin Planwerk Innenstadt can claim to be the first Berlin inner-city plans, which went through with declared urban economic objectives. The fundamental suggestion of the Planwerk was: inner development precedes external development; that means development of a functioning inner-city core instead of sprawling across the surrounding countryside. This approach demands breaking with the planning objective of the modern age, to dismember the city into mono-functional large areas. Instead of this, the approach intends the creation of smaller units of social and function mixing and co-determination of the plots to the point of the city quarter. The Planwerk Innenstadt led to a passionate argument between partisans and critics of the modern style in the specialist community, which also brought itself to international attention.
Particularly innovative is the conversion of the abstract planning objectives. In this way, Senate-owned plots in the inner city were to be sold off at a cheap price to allow the building of residential buildings in immediate city locations. The background for such considerations are the comprehensive calculations, according to which every new apartment on the periphery of the city would result in investments in the public infrastructure. With the attempt to develop the inner city more strongly than before as a residential area as well, the Senate would like to counteract the persistent exodus from the city centre.
As one of the larger projects that would not have been possible without this debate, 50 town houses on plots with a width of over 200 feet were developed in the Friedrichswerder quarter by the end of 2006. On filet plots between the Auswärtiges Amt and Gendarmenmarkt, 50 private landowners had the chance to reconstruct a piece of the urban settlement area - the heart of every traditional European city. Despite the strict design regulations, the impressive ensemble exemplifies what successful urban architecture can look like today if building sites are not only realized on a large scale.
In 2007, Regula Lüscher accepted office as Senate Building Director for Urban Development and introduced a new concept of urban development. On the basis of Stimmann's concepts, the Planwerk Innenstadt was revised and methodically and spatially adjusted to meet the city's current development. Berlin began to grow again and required new strategies for the future. Thus it was decided in 2011, to implement the “Planwerk Innere Stadt” plan, which also includes developments on the outskirts of the inner city. Major planning projects include the development of Europacity, a new city district to the north of the central station, as well as the former Tempelhof Airport (no. 249). The controversy surrounding these two projects show that discussions about Berlin’s urban development are far from over.",,,New Berlin: 1989-Present,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,

Even today, long after it has disappeared, its repercussions can still be perceived: the Berlin Wall divided more than just a city; it also separated two different societies.
When it was built on 13th August 1961, the western part of Berlin, which had received around 200,000 citizens from East Berlin since the division of administrations, experienced a shock. Once the separation of the surrounding area became physically manifest, impulses from the outside were lacking. West Berlin lost almost a fifth of its inhabitants until the start of the 1980s. It was primarily the top performers who decided to flee. Industrial groups like AEG and Siemens relocated their head offices to the Federal Republic of Germany on the western side of the Wall. The metropolis with the Wall served more as an extended workbench. The property market collapsed. The elites said goodbye. ""It is a not a culturally pessimistic exaggeration to describe the situation “as apocalyptic,” wrote the architecture historian Vittorio Magnago Lampugnani in 1980. What remained was the retreat into the private world: in the front line city an allotment holder mentality established, and it is characteristic that the garden party of the building senator Harry Ristock from now on formed one of the main social events.
The view that was becoming increasingly widespread that the Iron Curtain was not just a temporary phenomenon was also fatal for the city's development. This did not only lead to the claim of the Federal Republic of Germany to Berlin as a ""capital in waiting* being formulated more infrequently and halfheartedly. Even the inner-city areas of West Berlin near the Berlin Wall were now treated as borderland in town planning terms, which actually amounted to recognition of the division. Politics were restricted mainly to sweetening the lives of the citizens in Berlin with perks: wage earners, for example, were given an eight percent Berlin bonus. Social housing was subsidized with billions. With a decreasing population, it produced around 20,000 new accommodation units each year. Satellite towns like the Märkisches quarter (see no. 330) and Gropiusstadt arose, each with 17,000 apartments. At the I same time, the period of Promoterism town so criticized by Modernism was eliminated in great style by the clear-cut redevelopment in order to create further large residential areas. Innovative building types were required mainly for the ideal of equal opportunities announced as part of the educational reform of 1964. Thus the trendy high-level centre of Swinemünder Straße (see no. 342) became one of the few expressive addresses in West Berlin in the early years of the Berlin Wall.
It must be said that the egalitarian spirit celebrated its true triumphs where it had always been espoused: in I the ""capital of the GDR”, If, since the foundation of the GDR, around one sixth of the citizens had turned their backs : on it, it saw itself as consolidated by the I construction of the Berlin Wall: the disruptive critics largely had migrated. At
the same time, in one fell swoop, 110,000 workers who had previously been hired out in West Berlin were “brought home* to the “paradise* of the working people. The population losses before the Berlin Wall was built could be compensated for within the next two decades. Since the open competition of systems had ceased to exist, the collective could now develop in its pure form. As a key project the socialist city centre (see no. 309) was now realized. Since even the best comrade also sometimes needed a rest from the harmony of the collective, however, “dachas"", the eastern variant of the allotment garden, soon began to proliferate into the city’s surroundings.
So the division of Berlin basically had a levelling effect on both halves of the city. On both sides, a provision mentality also became established. When the Berlin Wall finally fell and normality arrived, there were therefore often hysterical reactions because of fear of a loss of traditional benefices.",,,International Style: 1961-1979,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,

"Hansaviertel, Berlin",52.5213115,13.3433225,Architecture,3,FALSE,Competing Systems,Concept,,,"The political division of Germany soon became a determining factor in Berlin architecture. In the western part of the city, they were forced at first to build those institutions which were traditionally located in the city centre and were now under Soviet control (university, people’s theatre, business centre etc.). In East Berlin, the new social system also had to be given an architectural foundation.
In East Berlin, Stalinallee was meant to show socialism from its most attractive side (see no. 263). On the road, there were not only countless schools, sports locations and parks generously built, but its 5,000 apartments were also opulent in terms of size and furnishings and equipment (district heating, waste disposal units). Stalinailee was created into a classic Via Triumphalis with grass verges and squares and a palace-like development. With a breakthrough at Alexanderplatz, not only the workers’ district of Friedrichshain was linked directly to the centre, but there was also a "" presentative connection going all the way between Unter den Linden and Stalinallee.
West Berlin reacted to the national construction work in the eastern part of the city with a competition (1953) to elevate the resettlement of the Hansa
Quarter, which had been destroyed in the war, to the core of an international building exhibition. Here it was discovered that the International Style was harmonizing best with the modern understanding of democracy. In fact, the ground plans for apartments were highly individual. The bungalow carpet, the rows of buildings and the high-rises which diverged radically from the old city formed a cityscape which created an all the more deep connection with the Tiergarten zoological garden area.
In 1957 the idea competition “Hauptstadt Berlin” was announced by the Federal government and the Berlin Senate. Since the competition area also covered the eastern sector, East Berlin countered in the following year with the “idea competition for the socialistic redevelopment of the centre of the GDR’s capital”. While its intentions were implemented after the construction of the Berlin Wall, its western counterpart remained largely without consequence.
From now on the visions of the town planners in the East and West were restricted to their own part of the city.",,,Reconstruction: 1945-1961,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,

Reconstruction of the parts damaged during the war only commenced in 1986, during which the remnants of the famous Ägyptischer Hof (Egyptian Courtyard) were also removed. »Reunification put an end to the planned true-to-the-original reconstruction (for which the corner stone was laid in 1989). Within the scope of the master plan for the Museumsinsel (until around 2025), the reconstruction was implemented from 1999 according to new plans by David Chipperfield. The competition announced in 1993 for the master plan to reorganize the entire museum grounds (restoration of the Alte Nationalgalerie (no. 89) until 2001 by HG Merz, restoration and expansion of the Bodemuseum (no. 131) until 2005 by Heinz Tesar, Altes Museum (no. 62), Pergamonmuseum (no. 153)) was originally won by Georg Grassi, against competitors such as Frank O. Gehry, who nevertheless withdrew from the plan in 1996.
Chipperfield's plans that include, in addition to the reconstruction of the Neues Museum, also a new main entrance with visitors’ centre, the James Simon gallery near the Kupfergraben and standardized access to the buildings (underground as an archaeological promenade or above ground as a colonnade), were adopted.
In 1997 he was commissioned by the Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz (Prussian cultural heritage fund) to reconstruct the Neues Museum. Chipper-field’s restoration particularly focused on the entirely destroyed northwestern wing and the projection on the southeastern side. He based his design on the volume of the Classicist building, while simplifying the details to such a degree that the wounds of the building and their healing were clearly distinguishable from the original structure. At first glance, the recycled brick tiles are the same color as the quarry stone of the old building, yet a second look reveals the look of a raw building deprived of its whitewashed surface and upon closer inspection it is clearly visible as an annex to the building. This attitude of a rigorously modern ""complementary reconstruction* without dwelling on the destruction and without emphasizing the contrast of old and new was already successfully applied by Hans Döllgast in the reconstruction of the Alte Pinakothek in Munich (1952-57). The reconstruction clearly distinguished between the existing structures and the additions, with entirely contemporary additions, yet allows the original building to be seen more or less complete and unaltered, while also maintaining its ruin character in the completed building. On the other hand, the respect for the original elements that does not permit the mixing with historicizing but newly created elements, was severely criticized in Berlin as many citizens and various interest groups desired a true-to-original reconstruction as planned by the GDR. ä Chipperfield’s conservation also incorporates as much as possible the original furnishings - Germany’s only surviving late Classicist museum interior - complementing missing parts in an obvious way without interpreting the existing segments fj a method that was also successful for the monument protection conservation of the fragmented remains of works of art. Original remnants of later changes (such as from the 1920s) were also preserved. However, totally missing parts, such as the frescos by Wilhelm von Kaulbach in the large staircase, were not copied. This space is among the best Berlin has to offer today.",,,New Berlin: 1989-Present,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,
"Breitscheidplatz, Berlin",52.5047297,13.3352316,Architecture,3,FALSE,Continuing Chaos - the Post-War Period,Era,,1945-1961,"Today, there is still a conflicting relationship to the Berlin architecture in the postwar years. The so-called reconstruction has been rightly called a ""second destruction” of the city. Yet a considerable number of these buildings have since been raised to the status of architectural monuments. From an architectural point of view, they often have little in common with each other as shown with the comparison of the “Hansa Quarter” (see no. 296) cityscape, kept in the modern style, with the monumental “Stalinallee"" mainline (nos. 274, 289, 297), which speaks a traditionalist language which National Socialism also used before. Its function also does not necessarily permit inference to the developers: the Hansa Quarter as a prestigious object of West Berlin is a social residential area, Stalinallee as the “first address” of the apparently “anti-imperialistic” “workers’ and farmers’ state” an imperial splendor mile.
In fact, the chaos that prevailed after 1945 is reflected in all these refractions. The former Reich capital was “the largest contiguous area of ruins in Europe”. Around 40 percent of the living space was destroyed, two thirds of the city centre in ruins - in particular to the south of the Memorial Church (no. 302), between Potsdamer Platz and Ostbahnhof.
The first reconstruction plans were also subject to psychological paralysis. The consequence from the catastrophe of the Second World War, it was said, could only be dealt with by means of a radical break with the past. Large parts of the old city in which society’s memory had become a fixed pillar were to fall victim to this thinking.
With regard to the formation of the future, there was a lack of conception, though, which is shown not least by the most radical design of these years: the “Collective Plan”, which Hans Scharoun (no. 281) introduced as the first Berlin senior government building officer after the war, did not succeed in creating a new aimed-for identity in terms of urban development. Air raids and disassembly had reduced the economic capacity of the once largest industrial metropolis of the continent by 85 percent. Of the 4.3 million Berliners (1939), hardly more than 2.3 million remained.
Only the Marshall Plan introduced in 1947, the goal of which was an economic and subsequent political consolidation of Western Europe, brought about change. The American aid program totaling billions did not just revitalize the economy: with material prosperity, it was possible to remove the NS ideology as well and, at the same time, it was to serve a policy of “containment” of communist influence. In the cultural sector, too, there were efforts to contain nationalism: the influence was again the Modernism (see no. 210) of the Weimar Republic which now returned to Germany as International Style from America. The West's desire to be new again was typified in the virginal white of the residential communities.
For the Soviet occupying power, however, the communist society was the logical consequence of history. Since the sympathizers of this utopia had the power but no democratic or material basis, (the latter even being undermined by the USSR by its dismantling and clearing activities) they developed suggestive dialectics: “National in form, socialistic in content” which should enable the revolution to succeed. This meant that as part of the “national construction work” (no. 296), workers’ palaces, educational temples and countless monuments were built to promote the way of the East towards a different Germany.
At least, the competition between both systems had a positive effect for Berlin: building was done with twice the energy. But at the same time the conflict of interests of the superpowers prevented a mutual policy. And what is more: in 1948, as a consequence of the Berlin blockade, there was a division of the city government. Berlin developed into an international crisis hotspot. Finally, when the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, this indicated that it was not only in town planning that the ideological differences had become insurmountable.",,,Reconstruction: 1945-1961,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,

This begins with the very concept which suggests constant renewal but has now itself become historical. “Modernism” indicated much more of a distinct period which started around the year 1900. Charles Jencks, the British architecture historian and spiritual father of post modernism described the year 1972 as the end of modernism. At that time residential buildings were being demolished in the US city of St. Louis, which (although only 20 years old) had been constantly criticised by its inhabitants since the time they moved in. What had happened that an entire period could be declared over due to the demolition of one single building complex?
In architectural history terms modernism can initially be valued as the reaction towards the historicism that was principally abounded at the end of the 19th century and its blunt copying of old building styles. The fathers of the movement, without being aware of the fact, were primarily Peter Behrens, Walter Gropius and Alfred Messel. While Behrens and Messel still attempted to develop new building types from old ones, Gropius shut his eyes to all forms of tradition and, as the founder of the Bauhaus style in Weimar, even had the library history books burned. The dispute was also carried out in Berlin from an ideological and architectural point of view. Messel built the Wertheim department store on Leipziger Platz (no. 137) and attempted to provide a new type of building with a form through his monumental facade, which was based on an already existing formal canon. Behrens attempted the same thing with his turbine hail building in Moabit (see no. 151). Set against this, Gropius and his supporters tried their hands at constructions which radically rejected decoration and ornaments. Their projects were to go dowm in history as “white modernism”. On the other hand, the expressionists applied more colourful and imaginative techniques. Their designs, which remained unrealised for a long time, now bear witness to the attempt to provide architecture with a new impulse through crystalline building forms and bright colours. The forerunners were primarily Bruno Taut and Hans Scharoun (no. 281).
After 1945 the “Modernism"" concept was resurrected following the period during the Third Reich when its trends had been predominantly surpassed. To this day, people are still considering which aspects of this movement can be salvaged for the future under the keyword of “second modernism"".

"Kurfürstendamm, Berlin",52.5044,13.3353524,Architecture,3,FALSE,From Capital of the Empire to European Metropolis,Era,,1871-1918,"With the founding of the German Reich in 1871, Berlin took the final step to becoming the political, economic and cultural centre of Germany. The metropolis attracted migrants from throughout Germany like no other city. In the last four decades of the 19th century, the number of inhabitants quadrupled from 500,000 to two million. The reparation payments from France, defeated in the Franco-Prussian War, led to a general economic upswing. A characteristic aspect of this era, often referred to as “Wilhelminian”, after the Kaisers Wilhelm I and Wilhelm II, was that Germany, although economically the most advanced nation in Europe, had the most regressive political constitution.
A consequence of this period of upheaval was a fundamental alteration of the visage of the city. Within the space of Just a few decades, the historic city centre and Tiergarten (no. 60) were surrounded by an enormous ring of tenement districts (no. 113), with numerous churches, schools, hospitals, public baths and public parks. In 1873, work began on a new sewer network, to plans by the construction counsellor James Hobrecht (no. 74), supported by the doctor and politician Rudolf Virchow. This sewer system is still in functional use today. At the turn of the century the “world’s largest tenement district” was both one of the healthiest and cleanest major cities in Europe. The architecture of the municipal buildings was influenced heavily around the turn of the century by Ludwig Hoffmann (no. 141), who was construction counsellor in Berlin for a period of almost 30 years.
The middle classes were attracted primarily to the “Neuer Westen”, the centre of which became established in the neo-Romanesque district around the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedachtniskirche (no. 107). The Kurfürstendamm (no. 145) was laid out to a width of 177 feet, and was soon flanked on either side by ostentatious residential buildings. Wilmersdorf and Schoneberg also saw breathtaking growth in new street networks, interspersed with decorative squares (see Viktoria-Luise-Platz no. 120). The centre of the city saw the addition of two poorly-situated Wilhelminian state buildings, the Reichstag building (no. 106) and the Berliner Dom.
The drive for the decorative saw a blooming of the city. Every unused space, every green area was decorated with sculptures from the school of Berliner Realismus. The most famous sculptor of the time was Reinhold Begas, whose works included the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Denkmal memorial at the Schlossfreiheit, demolished after the war along with the Berlin Stadtschloss (no. 7).
The first lines for the over ground and underground urban railways were built. Before the gates of the former city walls, a ring of railway stations, port facilities, city canals, slaughterhouses and giant factories grew. In 1882, the first electric arc lamps were fitted in Leipziger Straße and on Potsdamer Platz, three years later the first large municipal power station entered into operation.
In 1910, the capital held an urban planning competition (no. 157), covering a much larger area than the municipal area, which by 1920 had reached the borders that it occupies today. This was the first attempt to plan the Greater Berlin area.
No other European metropolis had investigated this theme at such an early stage.
At the same time, in Berlin in the early years of the 20th century (similarly to the beginning of the 19th century), a new architectural form of European influence took shape: Alfred Messel designed his large department stores (of which no single example remains today (see no. 126, 137)) and Peter Behrens built the famous turbine hall for AEG (no. 151).
These novelties are often described as a “preliminary stage” for the Modernist era of the 1920s. For the Berlin architectural historian Julius Posener, in contrast, this evaluation is an inadequate one. He notes that, “this era ... has its own colour and its own value”, and, moreover, “that the years up to 1918 were the decisive ones”.",,,Historicism 1871-1918,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,
"Museum Island, Berlin",52.5169328,13.4018997,Architecture,3,FALSE,From Prussian Residence to Capital of the German Empire ,,,,"The first indication of a new era in Berlin was a lively intellectual movement. In the famous salons of the city, the leading heads of the burgeoning middle class met to debate the ideas of the Enlightenment, art and literature. In 1791, as the starting signal for a new architectural age, Carl Gotthard Langhans erected his neo-Greek Brandenburger Tor (no. 40) between the Baroque palaces on Pariser Platz. With its references to the ancient world, Classicism stood for the ideal of a free civic society.
The military defeat at the hand of Napoleon, which heralded the collapse of Prussian absolutism, provided a new impetus for this breakthrough. A small group of reformers grouped around Freiherr vom Stein introduced a phase of political and intellectual renewal. One of the more durable reforms was the new Städteordnung, the municipal self-administration, of 1808, which heralded the self-government of the Prussian state.
In 1810, Wilhelm von Humboldt founded the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Universitat (today’s Humboldt University), with lectures held, amongst others, by Fichte,
Hegel, Schleiermacher and Ranke. The school system was improved; after 1850 there were scarcely any children of school age that were not being taught.
The political constitution of Prussia, on the other hand, failed to fulfill the expectations of the citizens. However, one of the contradictory aspects of Berlin is that, in the time of political repression and social problems, science and education, arts and culture experienced one of their most glorious ages.
The outstanding architect of this time was Karl Friedrich Schinkel (no. 44). He not only left his mark on the face of the city with outstanding buildings such as the Neue Wache (no. 52), the Schauspielhaus (no. 54) and the Altes Museum (no. 62), as chief Prussian civil servant in the field of construction he also controlled and improved all other significant construction projects in the city, and throughout Prussia. Schinkel handed Berlin architecture of a European radiance, of a type that it was only to replicate again at the beginning of the 20th century. The works of his numerous pupils, such as Stüler, Strack or Persius (the so-called Schinkel school) led to his influence remaining tangible in the architecture of Berlin up to the establishment of the German Reich in 1871. The numerous churches, municipal buildings and residential houses of the Schinkel school are characterized by cuboid structures, harmonious proportions, restrained ornamentation and careful details. The archetype of Schinkel’s Bauakademie (no. 65) can be seen on the facades of many buildings.
In the layout of the new city districts, a decisive role was played by the garden architect Peter Josef Lenne. The Royal director of gardens was handed responsibility for all urban planning in 1840. The principle result of his work was an overall plan for decorative and peripheral elements, which foresaw, amongst other projects, a semi-circular boulevard for the north and east of the city, as well as a broad axis to the south of the centre, broken up by squares. A large proportion of these plans were subsequently incorporated into the 1862 development plan of James Hobrecht (no. 74). In the so-called “Hobrecht plan”, the pattern of streets was laid out upon which the dense Berlin of tenement houses was to grow over the following 50 years, a pattern that continues to characterize the inner-city areas to this day.
Where liberal ideas were suppressed in the political field, the commercial and industrial policies of Prussia followed the principle of free trade. The highest priority here was the establishment of a competitive industrial base in keeping with the European industrialized nations, the most modern of which was Great Britain.
In the 1830s, an economic dynamism gathered pace that, in just a few decades, was to turn the royal capital city of Prussia into the pre-eminent German industrial metropolis. 1837 saw the opening of the first railway line in Prussia, between Berlin and Potsdam. Berlin expanded beyond the city walls, which had been removed by the second half of the 19th century. Following the war with Napoleon, Berlin numbered a mere 160,000 inhabitants, by the eve of the establishment of the German Reich in 1871 the city already boasted a population of 800,000.",,,Neo-Classicism: 1790-1871,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,

This reputation is wholly due to three large structures on the square, as the historic structures edging the square (of which only four survive to the present day) were not prominent, with the same true of the very different buildings of recent decades. The square is home to the Schauspielhaus, built by Karl Friedrich Schinkel (no. 44). It appears almost symmetrical, flanked as it is by the Fran-zosischer Dom - to the north - and the Deutscher Dom. It is a rare passer-by who notices that the Franzosische Dom stands slightly nearer the Schauspielhaus (no. 54) than its counterpart to the south.
The square was originally intended to be Friedrichstadtischer Markt, a market place, in the centre at the end of Friedrichstadt, laid out in rectangular form at the end of the 17th century. By decree, one church W'as built for the Huguenot French emigres and one for Germans. The French church, completed in 1705 to plans by Louis Cayart, was based upon the chief church of the Huguenots in Charenton, near Paris, which was destroyed in 1685. Martin Griinberg built the German church in 1708, on a floor plan that continued that of the Parochi-alkirche (no. 14): a pentagon with five semi-circular cupolas.
In 1735 the soldier King Friedrich Wilhelm I had stables added to both churches for his Gens d’armes regiment - the origin of the name Gendarmenmarkt. His son Friedrich 11 had these removed again, instead commissioning Karl von Gontard with the construction of two, completely identical, domed tower constructions, built between 1781-85. These towers had no practical purpose, serving merely as ornamental architecture for the decoration of the square.
The present-day outer appearance of the German church dates back to a reconstruction in 1882, with the interior redesigned along modern lines following reunification, for the display of German historical exhibits. In 1905, the facades of the French church were also altered, by Otto March, in neo-Baroque style.
The Gendarmenmarkt was heavily damaged in the Second World War. The GDR rebuilt the three grand buildings on the square - in partially altered form. Noteworthy here is the exposed stairway on the western side of the French church, a new addition from the early 1980s. In order to divide the interior of the church into two halls, the floor was lowered and a new suspended ceiling added in approximately 13-feet height. As a consequence, the stairway had to be augmented, leading to both the new lower church as w'ell as the upper church hall. The Baroque-sty le design blended effortlessly into the existing ensemble. The square was renamed Platz der Akademie in 1950, a decision reversed in 1991. The peripheral buildings opposite the Schauspielhaus allow a comparison to be made between two architectural levels: in the northeast stand three historic prefabricated buildings from the closing years of the GDR (see no. 347, 370, 374), to the southeast three commercial buildings in the Critical Reconstruction style of the 1990s: by Hil-mer-Sattler (light beige), Max Dudler (dark grey) and Josef Paul Kleihues (brown).",,,Baroque: 1600-1790,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,

"Herbert-von-Karajan-Straße 1, Berlin",52.5100776,13.369992,Architecture,3,FALSE,Hans Scharoun,Architect,,1893 (Bremerhaven) - 1972 (Berlin),"“...make a world out of the smallest part. ” Hans Scharoun, 1954
In his outlook for the year 2008, the editor-in-chief of the architecture magazine Baumeister, recently saw a few older people standing near the Philharmonic Hall. They are holding tattered slides up to the wind with the demand that the culture forum be completed in accordance to Hans Scharoun’s plans! For this fiction it needed little fantasy: there really is a Scharoun society. That it also acts as a caller in the desert fits in with an architect who created countless exceptional buildings - but no complete artwork which would have been continued. Hans Scharoun always stood as solid as a rock.
He was born in 1893 in Bremerhaven as the child of a trader who was always suspicious of the artistic tendencies of his son. He found the first encouragement of his talent from the neighbouring family of the architect Georg Hoffmeyer, whose daughter Scharoun would later marry. He completed his first plans at school: the seventeen-year-old boy gave the Bremen senior government building officer “fundamental considerations for the connection of land and sea"".
He was not able to complete his architecture studies, which he started in 1912 at the Charlottenburg Technical College, because he was conscripted at the start of World War One. During the war, Scharoun was appointed assistant head of the building consultation office in lnsterburg/East Prussia and dealt with the reconstruction of destroyed East Prussian towns. A member of the expressionists “Gläserne Kette“, a group of artists founded by Bruno Taut from the end of the war, from 1925-1932 he was a professor at the State Academy of Art and Applied Arts in Breslau but remained focussed on Berlin, where he opened his office in 1926 and joined the architects' association “Der Ring“, which also included Walter Gropius and Hugo Haring. With the latter, the mentor of organic building, he remained associated all his life.
For the German Werkbund he made several contributions, including in 1927 for the building exhibition at Stuttgart Weissenhof.
In Berlin, he designed part of the Siemensstadt large residential area: individual lines stretch into the sea of trees in Jungfernheide. A typical characteristic of Scharoun’s architecture is the use of maritim: motifs such as rails and portholes, like with the bachelors’ house at Kaiserdamm (no. 203). Ship quotes and city hostility are completely typical of the period here. The unique thing is reflected in the varied ground plans. They are therefore more individual than the architecture of these years, which was primarily aligned towards collective needs. In this period Scharoun found his very own theme - understanding the individual as the centre of architecture: in 1932 fourteen villas were constructed full of refractions and material variations. Only the inhabitants function as a fixed point of the buildings (see Haus Baensch no. 227).
It is obvious that Scharoun’s subject-( red architecture would have to come into conflict with the concept of art of the National Socialists. This is why he limited his activities to the construction of private detached houses during the Third Reich. The festival halls, railway stations and communal palaces which Scharoun designed for himself during the Second World War, however, make it evident that his architecture must also be seen as an attempt at a new social model. But above all, they radiate an optimism which is astonishing when we consider what was happening at the time.
So Scharoun became the man for Zero Hour. As the first post-war senior government building officer of Berlin, he presented in 1946 the (later mistakenly titled) “Collective Plan"". The plan he elaborated with a group of young architects provided for the creation of a new town structure coming from the position of Berlin in the glacial valley between Barnim and Teltow. Only the historic Unter den Linden street of houses and individual historic buildings were to remain. The entire rest of the structural legacy was there to be used. The fundamental idea is the design of a “city band” which, running parallel to the Spree, would combine all political, economic and cultural functions. The motorways which were to pass through the cityscape were going to be created in terms of North American chessboard road patterns. It was the most radical break with all town planning tradition. Scharoun visualised individual freedom and a new beginning - and therefore fulfilled the wishes of many people, especially in the West. But ultimately his plan was so subversive that it could not be implemented.
Hans Scharoun is seen as an intellectual authority for this reason alone. Already in 1946, he was no more than the town planning professor at the Berlin Technical University. He remained president of the Academy of Arts until 1968. During this period, he built a great deal, but always in solitary projects. The highlight of his achievements is the Philharmonic Hall at the Kulturforum (no. 307). This provides the best evidence of the rich collective experiences which his anthropocentric architecture enabled.",,,Reconstruction: 1945-1961,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,
"Leipziger Pl., Berlin",52.509605,13.3779332,Architecture,3,FALSE,Hans Stimmann,Architect,,141 (Lubeck) -,"*Berlin’s key concern is sustained urban development, which relates history and the future to one another. ”
Hans Stimmanap 1999
The man with the snow-white hair has a fiery temperament! Berlin discovered this after Hans Stimmann had become the city’s building director in 1991. A few weeks later, he dismissed proposals for the new development of Potsdamer Platz (no. 412), which renowned property developers had pressed ahead with, as “childish”, “unrealistic” or “stupid”.
It may be the case that the state tasks are being privatized everywhere: Stimmann insisted upon public leadership. He wanted streets, square and blocks of houses that were based upon historical ground plans, lines of buildings and eaves heights.
The billionaire investor Eduard Reuter who had visions of an American city with high-rise buildings and shopping immediately felt as if he had been whisked away into a provincial “hamlet”. In this process, the tradition of the European city was already successfully revived by Josef Paul Kleihues (no. 356) during the International Building Exhibition at the start of the 1980s. Stimmann simply updated the strategy and implemented it in a more universal manner. He was able to do this because everyone wanted to invest in Berlin as quickly as possible at that time. And also because the city of Berlin had provided Stimmann with something that no Berlin building director had had before him - the rank of a state secretary.
However* his biography ensures that this, by his own account, “powerful man” does not have his head in the clouds. The worth of the city was never called into question in his home city of Lübeck where he was the building inspector from 1986 until 1991. After his apprenticeship as a mason, he then went on to complete his training as a design engineer. The American office in Frankfurt/Main, in which he was only allowed to design refineries in the mid-1960’s, dismissed him as soon as orders became absent.
He moved to the turbulent city of Berlin in the politically heated 1970s In which there were lot of lively debates, in order to complete his doctorate in urban planning at the Technical University of Berlin.
He was called to Berlin in 1991 and governed in a decisive manner as the “aesthetic arm of the senator”. He patronized purist Prussian master builders who had to rein in their imagination and work on the craftsmanship details as well as solid stone. Ultimately his diktat of taste made the term “New Berlin” into a trademark that could be recognized throughout the world, which is not anachronistic in the age of globalization, but rather of essential importance for the city.
Stimmann made the most constructive contribution towards Berlin’s inner-city life after he was transferred to the urban development administration in 1996. He presented so-called “master plans” for the city as well as the outskirts of the city. They present the city in a form that could not be any livelier: as an organism with a heart and extremities, which both contribute towards its particular characteristics. This is revolutionary for Berlin, which had lived in parallel universes at the time when the Wall existed. The reactions have been correspondingly intense, not least due to the colonialist manner in which Stimmann dealt with the eastern Berlin milieu. Yet this time, he entered into dialogue with them because he did not have any power bar the power of his arguments. In an unparalleled process of co-determination, Stimmann’s “master plan” became a generally accepted city agenda. The New Centre force had found itself in 1999 at least in the minds of those responsible.
In his third term of office, Stimmann devoted himself to the realization of the “master plan” (no. 487), even though he is now more moderate in his approach - particularly in terms of style. Nevertheless, scandals connected to the financing of Peter Zumthor’s concept for the documentation centre Topographie des Terrors (no. 530) as well as the redevelopment of the Spreedreieck caused him difficulties.
What remained after his retirement from office is the impact of his aesthetic and planning parameters that still polarize architects nationally and internationally. Irrespective of this, he has achieved more for the city during his 15 years in office than any other building official of the current age. By critically reconstructing the urban space, he made historical traces Berlin, destroyed during the war, visible again and shaped the face of lisp metropolis like no one else since the reunification.",,,New Berlin: 1989-Present,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,

"Fernsehturm, Berlin",52.520815,13.4094191,Architecture,3,FALSE,Hermann Henselmann,Architect,,1905 in Roßla (Harz) - 1995 Berlin,"“People have nothing against being called typical citizens of a state but they have a lot against being called typified. ”
Hermann Henselmann, 1967
Whether retro style as with Stalinallee (see no. 294) or a futuristic form like with the Fernsehturm (no. 322): Hermann Henselmann predetermined what is today known as the best architecture of the GDR. Here he was rather unloved as a colleague, neither a perfect nor principled planner and (according to his own manifest) everything but a worker.
Maybe his success is explained by the fact that he represented the opposite of the type of person desired by socialism: the self-promoter.
Henselmann grew up in Bernburg (Saale) as the son of a cabinet maker. After an apprenticeship as a joiner he refused to take over his father’s business, however, and went to Berlin to study interior design and architecture at the School of Craftsmen and Applied Arts. He led the life of a bohemian, reading the “Weltbühne”, listening to lectures of the socialist art historian Max Deri and mak-
ing his way as a draft illustrator. His main role model was Le Corbusier, whom he met in 1930. Near Geneva, Henselmann completed the Kenwin Villa, which could also have originated from his idol. It had, admittedly, been designed by the film architect Ferency who died during the construction work. However, Henselmann passed off the building solely as his own work.
However, Henselmann was unable to assert himself with his own powers. The four homes he realised by 1934 had to alienate planning craftsmen, civil builders and National Socialist “culture guardians*: when the Kampfbund für deutsche Kultur, the battle league for German culture demanded the demolition of his work at Weinmeisterhöhe, which was disparaged as “bolshevist building”, Henselmann knew that he had no chance in the Third Reich. In 1941 he was excluded from the Reichskammer der bildenden Künste, the Reich’s chamber of fine arts, as a “half-Jew”. Despite this, he still managed to maneuver by stealth and keep his head above water with civil contracts: with his talent for drawing he was soon decorating estates in the Warta region with blood and soil jewelry and therefore avoided army duty.
At the end of the war, Henselmann was forty. Now the communists were to enable him to pursue his longed-for career. In July 1945, the provisional supervision of the Weimar College of Architecture was transferred to him. When this was reorganised he tied in with the traditions of the Bauhaus style which had been founded In 1919 at the same location by Walter Gropius. Under Henselmann’s supervision there were model plans for collective houses, and finally he was given a post in Berlin which had to be seen as strategic for the structural development of the GDR: at the newly founded German Bauakademie, he became director of the Institute for Theory and History of Architecture in 1951, which assessed German building traditions as commissioned by the state. So he was there when in the summer there was to be a signal for construction at the later Stalinallee: admittedly his visions for the high-rise at Weberwiese (no. 274) were able to dissuade the SED leadership from embarking on its wedding cake style ideal just as little as those of his rivals. But just as vocal as Henselmann was in this discussion as a defender of Modernism (so that only he was personally attacked in the SED-newspaper “Neues Deutschland”), he was equally quick to follow the party line afterwards. The alternative, already previously laid down by his colleagues, was awarded the contract and Hermann Henselmann was generally recognised as the main representative of GDR architecture.
He used his special position to exert influence. Soon nobody who was interested in East German architecture could get by Henselmann anymore. His residence in Pankow was one of the few open houses in the GDR. His attempts to keep the prefabricated residential areas away from the norm admittedly ended with the formal rounding off of Leninplatz. He was more successful in influencing the symbolism of the state: as an unofficial participant he designed, in the centre competition in 1958, the picture of a tower of signals in a place where a government high-rise was required. At first this move cost him- his position as Berlin’s chief architect which he had held since 1953. But finally it became apparent that only politically neutral city crowns could be implemented: so with the Television Tower (no. 322) a highly visible new statement was made which was never achieved in this form in the West. It is so universal that it is now appreciated by most people across all borders.",,,International Style: 1961-1979,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,

"Hufeisensiedlung, Berlin",52.4482189,13.4498942,Architecture,3,FALSE,Housing Development: Hopes for a New Social Beginning,Concept,,,"After the First World War, there was an enormous housing shortage in Berlin. Therefore, despite inflation and the economic crisis, the first Greater-Berlin council, which had been formed in 1920, declared the creation of affordable housing to be an important objective of their policy. Following the motto of “light, air and sun”, new style housing estates developed not only in Berlin. In reaction to the construction in the Gründerzeit, which had been almost exclusively privately financed and had made as much as possible from the land plots, new residential estates emerged, in which colourful houses were scattered loosely in park-like complexes.
The housing development of the Modern age, to which representatives such as Bruno Taut and Martin Wagner (no. 185) belong, falls at the same time as the establishment of property developers, who were characterised by the trade unions, cooperatives or non-profit making organisations. As the owners and operators of the housing development, as well as the physical builders of the buildings, they also took care of the collective approach in the operation of the predominantly worker-inhabited quarters. Large industrial operations, such as the AEG or Siemens, also built new residential areas in the immediate neighbourhood to the companies. Among the most well-known is Siemensstadt (no. 215) in today's district of Spandau. On the whole, all settlements were situated outside of the Berlin S-Bahn ring, as it was only here where large enough land plots were situated at reasonable prices.
Typologically, the architects broke with everything that had existed up until then. They said goodbye to the block-by-block development of the quarters and built their residential buildings in the form of ribbons or point blocks in the open landscape. With this anti-urban city model, they actually offered a counter concept to the traditional city of the 19th century. In the years between 1924 and 1930 alone, over 140,000 new apartments emerged in Berlin. This enormous building activity was accompanied by a debate on architecture, where the protagonists of a new Modern era fought with the traditionalists about steep and flat roofs. As National Socialism heralded the end of the Weimar Republic, even the modern housing developments were called into disrepute. From now on, new residential blocks lost their colour and were given steep roofs.

The housing estate was intended for workers. It was therefore supposed to be an example of standardised construction and large-scale production techniques, with the objective of keeping the construction costs (and consequently the rent prices) low. For instance, the excavation of earth and transportation were mechanised. The workers were nevertheless still unable to afford the houses. Salaried employees and civil servants moved into the houses instead. The core of the estate is formed by the white-plastered “Hufeisen”, a horse-shoe which bends around a flat depression. This extensive “line” is formed from just one type of house, as the serial production required simple and cheap forms, that adapted as well as possible to the lie of the land and involved little earth excavation. The garden design is based on one of Leberecht Migge’s drafts. The Britzer piece de resistance of the construction of workers’ housing is delineated from a romantic, neighbouring housing estate of the Beamtenbauverein, the civil servants’ construction association, through a “red front” comprising 32 identical residential buildings. Taut made intensive use of colour as a design element in addition to brick elements to structure the body shell.

In the 1970s, East Berlin experienced a huge improvement in its reputation thanks to the recognition of the GDR by Western states. The associated arrival of diplomats gave this part of the city a certain international flair. At the same time, however, the system comparison closed in again on the GDR increasingly: Western television did not stop at any wall. By arousing consumption desires in East German living rooms which could not be fulfilled, it put the standard of living in the East in a particularly unfavourable light. Since Erich Honecker had assumed office, the solution of the supply question therefore had the highest priority.
In the area of construction this led to the passing of the apartment building programme. In Marzahn (see no. 358) at the start of the 1980s the biggest residential area of the GDR was completed. The primacy of apartment building caused high deficits: thoroughly desired ideologically, the old building substance was systematically abandoned to decline so that in 1989 every fifteenth apartment was uninhabitable.
The immaterial damage was even higher though: the development of socialism had become a monotonous process which had to quench creativity. Normal citizens whom it helped get a new apartment did not see themselves as animated for involvement in collective ideals and instead were incited to withdraw into their private lives and consumption.
This is how the GDR increasingly lost support among the population. The SED heads became increasingly defensive and reacted with the expansion of the police informer system of state security. At the same time, they went without adhering too strictly to sublime ideological principles and thought increasingly of Prussian traditions. The symbolic act of the 1980s was therefore not the establishment of the Marx-Engels-Forum (no. 357) but the return of the monument of the Prussian King Friedrich II, who was once vilified as reactionary, to its original home on Unter den Linden at around the same time. Generally the most remarkable efforts in the capital were geared towards the vedutes of the past. East Berlin was caught up by history.
West Berlin, however, had now recovered from the shock of the Berlin Wall being built. Life had largely returned to normal thanks to the ease of travelling through the GDR enabled by the Four Power Agreement. This development led not only to increased arrivals from the Federal Republic but also to the fact that West Berlin could now think of itself again. A real tourist boom also began now. And the visitors were also less interested in the newly built tower blocks than in the aura of Berlin - and this had its roots in history. So the determination of the past and no longer the swan song for the old soon dominated the discourse: “attempt at a balance” was the programmatic title of the large Prussia exhibition in 1981.
The young generation had also long since discovered the old, unrenovated parts of the city as free space. In Kreuzberg particularly, there developed an alternative culture whose spearhead was the taz which had been published since 1979 - a new foundation in Berlin which there had not been anything similar for a long time! This scene was ready to start civil war to defend its way of life. But it did not come to this because the “Western system” - unlike the GDR - showed itself capable of reform. The clear-cut renovation was stopped. Mayor Richard von Weizsäcker pacified the city after 1981 by concluding contracts with the squatters and even making them owners.
A new, active cultural life developed. In 1984 the International Building Exhibition (see no. 355) was organized.

fames Hobrecht, 1868
James Hobrecht created what continues to be the core of the German capital to this day: the urban development plan that, during the Kaiser era, turned Berlin into the “largest tenement city in Europe” (see no. 113), together with a sewer system that was to establish itself as the most resilient network in the city. Following a significant period in which the “tenement* model was held to be an example of inhuman construction, Hobrecht’s work is now generally acclaimed. Attempts are now even underway to rebuild the Gründerzeit city.
James Hobrecht (the first name came from English ancestors) was born in 1825 in the eastern part of East Prussia, the second of five children. He broke off his studies in agriculture, working initially as a surveyor, moving to the Prussian capital in 1847, in order to pursue his studies at the Bauakademie (no. 65). One year later, the revolution broke out. As a National Liberal fighting on the side of the rebels, Hobrecht remained a child of the 1848 revolution for the rest of his days: marked by his experience that seemingly immovable circumstances can be brought into motion, and that freedom and self-determination of the people are no longer abstract formulations.
It is against this background that the development plan of 1862 should be seen, conceived by Hobrecht as the government's master builder on behalf of the Berlin Chief of Police. The fact that the population of the city had doubled in scarcely 25 years led to him extending the municipal area by five and half times its size. Legislation was more supportive of the public sphere than that of the property owners, who nonetheless maintained their grip on state power due to the linkage of suffrage with property ownership. Hobrecht developed a street plan interspersed at relatively regular intervals by squares. The streets were 72 feet wide or more, and laid out as decoratively as the garden artist Peter Joseph Lenne (see no. 60) had previously decreed.
A minimum of rules enabled a maximum of urban growth: with the entry into force of the development plan scarcely a decade passed before the population of Berlin had doubled again. Hobrecht favoured tenement buildings due to their “recommendable mixed habitation” of rich and poor - the richer inhabitants in the piano nobile at the front of the complex, poorer citizens in the roof and cellar apartments, as well as to the rear. This cohabitation of the different social classes did not last long, however. In addition, living in such close proximity soon endangered the health of the population: over one thousand inhabitants died each year from typhus alone, one of the principal reasons for this lying in the fact that excrement was collected in cess pits, which became breeding grounds for infection. After Hobrecht had pressed for hygiene to become a primary concern for some years, in the 1860s, as construction counsellor of Stettin he was able to plan and construct the sewage systems of the city, together with the waterworks. With this reference, and the support of the doctor and politician Rudolf Virchow, in 1872 he received the commission to construct a similar system for Berlin. Four years later the sewage system was inaugurated, with completion in 1907. In contrast to systems such as that in use in London, the sewage was not channelled into the rivers from which drinking water was drawn, but employed as fertiliser on fields. With this concept, Hobrecht became a leading and recognised urban engineer for more than 30 German towns and cities. He also developed similar plans for Moscow, Cairo and Tokyo.
In 1885, Hobrecht was appointed construction counsellor for civil and underground engineering. During the 12-year occupancy of this position, he had the Spree regulated within the municipal district of Berlin, thus hindering flooding and water logging of the ground. In addition, 28 bridges were constructed, with at least six of these designed by Hobrecht himself. The effects of his municipal activity are still tangible in the urban landscape today.
On his retirement in 1897, Hobrecht was honoured by the city with the elevation of the privy construction counsellor to the position of alderman of Berlin. He remained an esteemed figure in his Field, associated intrinsically to construction in the capital as a member of the Konigliche Akademie des Bauwesens, the royal construction academy, and Berliner Architektenverein, Berlin’s architectural association, until his death in 1902.",,,Neo-Classicism: 1790-1871,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,

Josef Paul Kleihues, 1987
A discreet pair of glasses, a precise, but by no means loud voice - the self-confidence of having written architectural history in this city was expressed in every nuance. Josef Paul Kleihues was the doyen of Berlin’s architects. He had a decisive influence on what was built in this city in the last two decades.
Kleihues came from the Westphalian town of Rheine, a town whose Genius
Loci is determined by qualities such as solidity, constancy and a certain down-to-earth nature - qualities which had a considerable influence on the son of a building contractor.
The architecture studies in Berlin were characterized by the late expressionist anthropocentrics of Hans Scharoun (see no. 281). After his degree, he went to the. Paris Ecole des Beaux-Arts where, at the time, the conflict was raging between the defenders of the fine arts and the young representatives of the enlightenment, which, at the end of the sixties, would encompass the whole of society. Kleihues dealt with all these trends intellectually - but never really warmed to them.
It was his own combination of savoir vivre and roots which helped Kleihues succeed in West Berlin, where he had opened his office in 1961. The experts were astonished when, in 1973 with the construction of the new Neukölln hospital, he preserved the substance of the old building and cautiously added to it - a real novelty at the time. Together with Wolf Jobst Siedler, he initiated a series of articles on town planning questions in the Berliner Morgenpost in 1977. This ultimately convinced the Senate to implement the biggest support action conceivable for architects: the organisation of the International Building ExhilMat (IBA) {see no. 355).
Kleihues became director of its new building section and here he was so undogmatic as to also invite architects whose aesthetic views he did not share - which helped make Berlin, with the IBA, one of the world’s architecture 'capitals. The most promising heads of the world such as Daniel Libeskind and Zaha Hadid were thus given their first opportunity to build. Kleihues used the budget of 85 million made available to him here to a not inconsiderable extent in order to make the results of this workshop known worldwide. Soon even the US magazine Time was recognizing “the organization of the most ambitious display of this generation in world architectural standards”.
Here, Kleihues gave the global spirit of the age only limited scope. The star architects were able to indulge in details - but he still largely provided the guidelines: the houses must be built on the basis of the traditional city, i.e. under consideration of the historic ground plan. The principle of “critical reconstruction” was actually revolutionary on the River Spree. This is because Berlin had, for at least a hundred years, been used to implementing every concoction without asking questions. But since 1968 the criticism of the modern bad been articulated, and the resumption of historic continuity appeared as the only possible prospect for the future within the Wall.
When the “anti-fascist protective wall” then fell, the IBA director had already taken the critical reconstruction so far to success that there could be no alternatives to this. While Senate Building Director Hans Stimmann (no. 404) accepted its implementation, Kleihues, as an “architect with an integrated building permit”, was given dozens of opportunities to put his ideas into his own buildings. He was probably most successful in the balancing act between traditional and modern with the Kant Triangle whose weather vane roof has to be seen as homage to the dancer Josephine Baker, who celebrated her triumphs in the “Golden Twenties” in the Theater des Westens lying opposite. But usually he remained as strict as with his first building, Block 270 (no. 340).
Finally Josef Paul Kleihues also rendered outstanding services in another area: In 2000 with a much-visited exhibition, in which the Berlin architecture history of the 20th century was recapitulated, he prepared the foundation for a local architecture museum. The fact that he deserves an outstanding place in this is indisputable.",,,Post Modern Period: 1979-1989,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,

Gerlach, 1735, no. 24) strikes into the city like a bolt of lightning. On the one hand, it has its special formal position, and on the other hand, it formulates the fault line of Jewish history. Libeskind created a very intellectually and structurally challenging work of architecture by means of the large-scale form of a Star of David that has been folded upwards. This demanding concept was also continued with in terms of the implementation details and in the process also made impossible constructions possible, such as wall pieces that “float” freely in glass surfaces. The construction follows an abstract network of reference points of Jewish culture and history in Berlin. Diffraction and confusion are stylistic tools. So-called “voids”, areas that people cannot go through, were an option to implement the unspeakable for Libeskind - the destruction of Jewish life. ""However, the building was also subjected to some modifications of its basic design (competition 1989). It was thus impossible to implement the sloped position of the external walls. Even when empty, i.e. without the exhibition that opened in 2001, visitors were attracted to the building in droves.

"Altes Meuseum, Berlin",52.5194665,13.3987445,Architecture,3,FALSE,Karl Friedrich Schickel,Architect,,1781 (Neuruppin) - 1841(Berlin),"Karl Friedrich Schinkel is the most significant German architect of the 19th century. He owes this position to his enormous creative energy, his extensile versatility (not only as architect and civil servant but also as painter, stage designer and furniture designer) and to the remarkable scope of his work. In his larger buildings and his written works, Schinkel returned time and again to the basic questions of architecture, answering these in his own manner. This is a further reason why Schinkel's works have remained vivid and fruitful like those of scarcely any other master builder.
His legacy is so universal that even today he is still quoted by the most varied of architects working in Berlin. The avant-garde point to perhaps the most famous of Schinkel's quotes: “True vitality only exists where new things are created.* More traditional master builders appreciate more the tectonic linkage of his historically-rooted structures and his talent for the picturesque. Born and raised in Neuruppin, Brandenburg. Karl Friedrich Schinkel moved to Berlin with his mother, who was widowed young. In Berlin he studied under Friedrich Gilly, also spending time in his family home. Gilly's individual style, with its hints at the architecture of the French Revolution, had a great influence upon Schinkels own designs.
His debut work was the Pomonatempel with Ionic porticus, erected in 1800 on the Pfingstberg in Potsdam. It has recently been restored. From 1803 to 1805, he travelled through Italy, France and Germany. Due to a lack of large commissions, Schinkel painted panoramas and dioramas, as well as romantic landscape paintings. An intensive interest in theatre sets followed; his most famous design is the starry sky for the appearance of the Queen of the Night in The Magic Flute.
In 1810, Schinkel was recommended by Wilhelm von Humboldt for an administrative position at the Prussian construction office, becoming privy construction counsellor in 1815 and director of the Prussian construction office in 1830. With this appointment, he was responsible for all large construction projects from the Rhineland to East Prussia, often intervening in their implementation.
Schinkel’s main works were built in Berlin between 1816 and 1830: the Neue Wache (no. 52), the Schauspielhaus (no. 54), and the building that Schinkel himself considered his best: the Altes Museum (no. 62). Influenced by Gilly’s drawings of the Marienburg, Shinkel also designed neo-Gothic structures such as the Kreuzberg Denkmal memorial (no. 53) or the Friedrichwerdersche kirche (no, 61).
Although Schinkel never constructed in a truly revolutionary style, in his later works he erected buildings that were oriented strongly towards their intended purpose, moving away from the classical lines of the ancient world, for example in the plans for a store on the Unter den Linden, which was never realized. He also incorporated the state-of-the-art construction techniques of the time into his buildings. Many of the later principles of Modernism can be seen here. However, a complete casting-off of the familiar forms was not the intention of Shinkel. On his voyage to England he noted, on seeing the modern, completely unornamented factory buildings: “It makes a terribly eerie impression, monstrous buildings constructed by workmen alone, without architecture and for the most basic of requirements.*
His talent for painting can be seen primarily in two smaller buildings in Potsdam, Schloss Charlottenhof and the Roman Baths. Numerous imaginative projects from his final years were never realized, but exercised a great influence on his pupils: a royal castle on the Acropolis in Athens and Castle Orianda in the Crimea, with the richly ornamented ancient Greek building forms dominating once more.
Schinkel’s most significant later work was the red brick cube of the Bauakademie (no. 65), a groundbreaking building in which he lived in an apartment with office.

When those responsible from the magistrate and construction ministry stopped the plans in the middle of 1950s, they already had five further modernistic lines realised in line with Helmut Riedel’s plans behind them which would not fit in with the politically sponsored project ""Stalinallee"" (see no. 296) or with the “Friedrichshain residential community"" designed by Hermann Henselmann (no. 331) next to the multi-storey building at Weberwiese (no. 274). The access balcony houses were later ""concealed” behind a row of poplars. The situation has remained like this to this day.

Ludwig Hoffmann
Ludwig Hoffmann built more structures In Berlin than Schlüter (no. 18), Knobelsdorff and Schinkel (no. 44) put together. He was the great organiser of the Wilhelminian construction projects and the most significant architect of municipal Berlin.
In the era of great economic expansion in the city, schools, hospitals, bath houses, fire stations and administrative buildings were all erected under his leadership, as “Islands of taste in a sea of grey stone”, as a contemporary critic put it. The majority of his buildings withstood the destruction of war and demolition almost untouched. They continue to exert their influence on the historic districts of Berlin to this day.
Hoffmann was born in Darmstadt on 30th june 1852, the son of a lawyer. He grew up in a middle class household.
After passing his Abitur school examination in his hometown, he left to study architecture in Berlin in 1874, together with his childhood friend Alfred Messel. He went on to become a favourite pupil of Johann Heinrich Strack, a former colleague of Schinkel.
Hoffmann’s breakthrough came with his design for the Reichsgericht courthouse in Leipzig. His work was awarded first prize of 119 submitted works. The building of the 35-year-old also met with widespread acclaim on its completion, making him one of the most sought-after architects in the country. Despite this, he rejected the offer of the position of privy counsellor, the highest construction official in the land. Instead, he was elected construction counsellor of Berlin in 1896, attracted by the manifold construction projects of the capital.
Hoffmann soon detached himself from the convention that specific building types required a specific style: churches were Gothic, museums Roman, courts of law in the style of the Renaissance. Hoffmann constructed his numerous schools in various styles; German Renaissance, Baroque style or the almost style-free brick structures of Schinkel.
Details that seem overloaded today were extremely modern at their time. The contemporary observer becomes aware of this at the latest on comparing Hoffmann’s buildings with the more extreme creations of Historicism. The architectural historian Julius Posener described Hoffmann’s buildings as ""likeable"": ""They were influenced by Wilhelminian optimism, and they wanted to generate confidence."" This friendly impression was achieved through two routes. One of these was surprising, picturesque deviations from strict formality. Hoffmann was also more sparing in his use of historic style elements than his contemporaries, there is nothing petty about his buildings, contours and facades are clearly readable: large roof surfaces with gently sculpted gables are common, or walls with large surface areas. A clear reference to more simple country house architecture is often noticeable. Perhaps the most typical example of Hoffmann’s “likeability"" is the Marchenbrunnen fountain in the Volkspark Friedrichshain (no. 91).
Hoffmann’s most significant buildings include the Stadthaus (no. 159), incorporating motifs from the Gontard towers on Gendarmenmarkt (see no. 13), the Markisches Museum (no. 146) with its collage of Brandenburg architectural references and the castle-like, neo-Baroque Rudolf-Virchow-Krankenhaus hospital. His oeuvre is almost limitless, encompassing over 60 schools and sports halls, 13 hospitals, eight bridges and five hath houses.
Hoffmann was construction counsellor for almost three decades. When he left office in 1924, the revolutionary house of the printer Max Taut had just been completed. However, this breach, caused by the onset of the Modern and its social utopia failed to attract Hoffmann as a follower. His intention had not been to change the political situation, but to satisfy it. He died in Berlin on 11 th November 1932.",,,Historicism: 1871-1918,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,

-Martin Wagner, 1915
The name of Martin Wagner is generally associated with two things. On the one hand, he is associated with the dissertation “The sanitary green of the cities. A contribution to the open spaces theory"", which he submitted in 1915. On the other hand, he is known for the residential estates that were constructed in Berlin it the second half of the 1920s. The theoretical work, which had already made him famous and caused much sensation by the age of just 30, can nevertheless be taken as the basis of his practical work at the Zweckverband Groß-Berlin, the council of Berlin and its surrounding communities, and then as Stadtbaurat, which is the head of the office for municipal planning and building control, first in Schöneberg, then in Greater-Berlin. In this function, Wagner, in contrast to all his predecessors, attempted to view urban development as an integrated discipline and to Incorporate green spaces and parks as obvious elements. This may be viewed as a reaction to Berlin's urban structures, which were solely oriented towards exploiting plots of lands and frequently led to catastrophically unhygienic living conditions. Wagner’s bold initiative consequently met with a more positive response from the politicians than from the private property developers, he did, after all, state in his academic work that the neighbouring proprietors - both private and state - would have to bear the costs of the green spaces.
His five guiding principles became a kind of manifesto for planners of green spaces. The demands expressed within it have characterised the design of open spaces to this day. Above all, Wagner’s reflections that there should be an “average of 260 square feet of children’s playground, 17 square feet of sports fields, 5 square feet of promenades, 22 square feet of parkland and 140 square feet of city forest” for each inhabitant, were deemed as being the dictum for urban green space planning offices in the form of so-called reference values until just a few years ago.
However, Martin Wagner has predominantly left behind visible traces of his work as an architect in the city. In his just seven years as the head of the municipal planning and building control office (his predecessor had actually managed to serve 4 times as long), he was responsible for significant building projects such as the Hufeisensiedlung housing estate (no. 193) and the lido Strandbad Wannsee (no. 212.). In addition, Wagner designed the Kriegerheimstatten estate in Friedrichsfeld, which was the first attempt at large-panel building in Germany.
There is no doubt that Martin Wagner was one of the most significant construction politicians of the 20th century. The Berlin-based architecture historian Karl-Heinz Hüter wrote: “In Wagner, a personality committed to social issues assumed the office of the head of the municipal planning and building control office. It comes as no surprise that he was only able to assert himself in certain sub-areas but failed in many others when one considers the opposing political and economic interests and the organised opposition of reactionary circles. His greatest achievement was to have decisively applied metropolitan standards to all the construction projects in Berlin and to have brought the “pioneer of a form of German building"" (Wagner) to the capital city. Without Wagner’s leadership, Berlin would not have been able to become the most significant centre of the new form of building.
After leaving the German civil service in 1933, (he had previously resigned from the Academy of Arts where he had attempted to oppose their political Gleichschaltung, the method of eliminating all opposition, Wagner emigrated to the United States where he lectured at Harvard University as a professor from 1938 until 1950.

"Platz der Republik, Berlin",52.518585,13.3731851,Architecture,3,FALSE,"New Old Capital: Novelty on the one Hand, Continuity on the Other",Concept,,,"20th June 1991 can be entered into the most significant dates in the youngest history of Berlin, after 3rd October 1990: with a tight majority, the Deutsche Bundestag voted in favour of transferring the seat of the government from Bonn to Berlin. Since the foundation of the Deutsches Reich, Berlin has administered uninterrupted capital and governmental functions. The city has a large spectrum of political buildings due to these functions. In addition, every era on the Spree has written new architectural history. This Is because with every new political system, the requirements on the city’s representation have changed. In this way, the Reichstag (no. 106) did not just embody the Kaiserzeit. It also formed a town planning counterweight to the Stadtschloss der Hohenzollern (no. 7) due to its monumentality. Even when the Volksvertreter (people’s representatives) in the Reichstag still did not have the political power of a parliament in today’s sense-of the word, the growing democracy manifested itself with a powerful building in the cityscape.
The political architecture of the Weimar Republic on the Other hand did not reach beyond the planning for the capital due to its frequent government changes. For the square in front of the Reichstag, after unsuccessful participation in the competition to expand the Reichstag, Hugo Haring put forward designs far a “Democratic Forum” in 1929. On a semicircular rostrum opening out towards the Reichstag, the people would be able to “take a seat” in the truest sense of the word and be able to enter into a symbolic interplay between parliament and public. Over sixty years later, the winners of the Spreebogen competition of 1993, Axel Schultes and Charlotte Frank took up this idea of a place for citizens again with the Bundesforum.
The cautious attempt in the Weimar Republic to formulate an architectonic expression for a democratic system, was initially ended with the assumption of power by the National Socialists. From 1933, numerous governmental buildings developed in Berlin, which were characterized by a clear tectonic organisation and stone solidity. On Wilhelmstraße, for example, between the years of 1934 and 1936, the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (no. 229) was erected in accordance with plans by Ernst Sagebiel. With the new construction on the corner of leipziger Straße, the Third Reich continued a tradition of governmental buildings, which had begun in the middle of the 19th century in Prussia: the extension of Wilhelmstraße to a governmental axis. After demolishing the Reichskanzlei and the Reichspräsidentenpalais, the over-dimensioned Neue Reichskanzlei (no. 248) developed there between 1937 and 1939 from a plan made by Albert Speer (no. 225). The1 Neue Reichskanzlers gallery of mirrors had gigantic dimensions of almost 500 feet.
A transfer Of political power from Wilhelmstraße began with the division of Berlin. The GDR had their most important political buildings constructed in the area of the Spree Island, among which the Staatsratsgebäude (no. 308) and the Palast der Republik (no. 337). Not far away, the central committee of the SED took up residence in the former Reichsbank (no. 450), which is still used today as the official residence of the Auswärtiges Amt and has come to stand exemplarily for a new self-image of the Federal Republic of Germany: the political and structural legacy of governmental buildings of past - mostly undemocratic - systems is not covered up. Instead it is put into a new context with the help of conversions or new buildings. The numerous governmental and parliamentary locations from the different eras contribute therefore to the fact that the Berlin cityscape has become a type of open-air museum of the political architecture in Germany.",,,New Berlin: 1989-Present,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,

Up to 2010, it was estimated that Berlin would house up to five million people. It had already experienced such a boom before, at the end of the 19th century: within a short number of decades, the population at that time doubled. In 1939, the city already had five million inhabitants. No wonder then, if the city’s development politics created space for the prognosed *New Berliners” with huge investment housing programmes. A city concept from the 19th century was revived: the suburb. At the same time, the decision for such city expansions was a refusal of the current trends in city development in other European metropolises, whose borders are not characterised through urban structures but through “wild growth”. All the projects were carried out in this sense, which were developed under the names of Neu-Karow, Französisch Buchholz, Rudower Felder etc.
Without a doubt, the most famous project is Neu-Karow - a suburb for about 5,000 inhabitants in Northeast Berlin. On the basis of a traditional city layout with streets, squares, and parks (design: Moore, Ruble, Yudell), within a few years, multi-story apartment blocks, apartment biases and terraces as well as schools, childcare facilities and shopping centres developed, Even if Neu-Karow was something of an experimental field for lots of young architects, the result is still sobering. Only a few buildings stand out from the masses because of their quality. The reason for this could be the rapid planning and construction time, through which otherwise consecutive planning stages were connected in parallel and implementation plant were drawn up without any binding development plan. Nevertheless, the suburb projects deserve recognition: In Neu-Karow, au-
thorities and investors entered into a Public-Private-Partnership, in which reduced development areas were sold to private project developers, who were then obligated on their side to create public infrastructures.

For decades, the Berlin Wall (no. 301) ran straight across the square. The most recent history of the square, which has become a synonym of the “new city of Berlin"", already started in the 1980s when plans were discussed for the “central area”. The basic idea at that time was to breathe new life into this peripheral inner-city area, which then led to the Daimler-Benz automotive group purchasing a plot of land, running from the Landwehrkanal to the wall zone, immediately prior to the fall of the Wall. The Wall fell whilst the contractual negotiations were still progressing, and a peripheral city location became a top site in the centre of a European city with a population of several million people virtually overnight.
The Senate launched an urban development competition, which the Munich-based architects Heinz Hilmer and Christoph Sattler won in the autumn of 1991,"" The master plan envisaged once again providing the former wasteland with the appearance of a European metropolis. In specific terms, this meant that the basic urban development' structure would adopt the block model of the Berlin city centre and was expected to emphasize the variety of uses of the city by means of mixing residential, working, cultural and shopping buildings.
The supposed recourse to a historical model of the city was not without its critics. Other architects who took part in the competition dreamt of the invention of a new type of cityscape that had never existed before or the implantation of an American city in the heart of Berlin. A passionate dispute between the architects involved ensued following this, which attracted the attention of the world’s media. This is because the points were supposed to be set for Berlin's future development at Potsdamer Platz.
Renzo Piano’s (Genoa/Paris) and Helmut Jahn’s (Chicago) ideas for the
specification of the master plan won through, who were commissioned by the large investors Daimler-Benz (now called: Daimler AG) and SONY. Whilst Piano enlisted the services of several other architects and provided a certain level of architectural diversity on the part of the 19 buildings in total (see nos. 398,460,467) Jahn provided a design forming “a united and integrated whole”. Hence the two largest projects to the west of Potsdamer Platz could not be any more different. SONY presented a homogeneous glass-steel form of architecture, which permitted a Plaza to be constructed in its centre. Daimler created a traditional European cityscape made of different individual buildings and narrow streets. The fact that the area was constructed at the end of the 20th century despite having a city typology that had been developed in the 19th century, cannot be overlooked: an underground car park with direct access to the Tiergarten tunnel pays homage to the product, which provided the proceeds to make all this possible - the car.
An equally significant project has been built as the final module around Potsdamer Platz. The Lenne-Dreieck by the investor Beisheim. In 2007, both SONY and Daimler announced the planned sale of their premises.

Construction in the National Socialism Era,Concept,,,"Does National Socialist architecture create a corresponding state of mind? Both German political systems in the post-war period were convinced of this, so all the architectural relics of National Socialism were removed. Even buildings with a politically neutral purpose fell victim to the wrecking ball, such as the Haus des Deutschen Fremdenverkehrs, the German tourism building, which once stood in the place of the Neue Nationalgalerie (no. 320). Where the post-war shortages compelled continued use, even pragmatism was faced with confrontation: for example, at the start of the 1960s, Klaus Tausendschön tried to retouch the effect of the Reichsluftfahrtministerium, the Reich Aviation Ministry (no. 229), which was used as the headquarters of the GDR planned economy, by putting a canteen as a glass box against the property in the yard. At the start of the 1990s, the prejudices were still maintained and the accusation of “fascist construction"" in the Berlin architecture dispute (see no. 375) was used as a killer argument against tradition-oriented building. Of course, there were also counter arguments which put National Socialist buildings in a global architectural history context. They set about revealing continuities or referring to the pluralism of forms of those years in which government buildings were constructed according to an antique archetype, with industrial buildings, for example, in the Bauhaus style and apartments and barracks in a conservative homeland security style. Were, then, the Nazi forms innocent in the final analysis?
Like many others, Adolf Hitler considered architecture as an “ideology set in stone”. His regime saw itself, to all intents and purposes, as modern, which explains the so-called “white industrial boxes”. But, the general opinion is that the modern age was hardly able to transport the ideological message of National Socialism. Like most rulers, Hitler therefore resorted to Classicism for representational purposes. However, National Socialism was far removed from its humanistic impetus. Instead of the individual, it knew only the species ""mankind”, as presented in the films of Leni Riefenstahl. Unlike modern mass society, where it is the crowd which acts, the National Socialist “national body” was subordinate to the ""Führer”. The mass was more solely an ornament and the architecture a means of gaining power over them. From Classicism, they wanted to assume the “power of influencing people” (Albert Speer). The result was disparately oversimplified forms and dimensions increased to the gigantic. Hitler’s Reichskanzlei, the Reich’s Chancellery (no. 248) was the best example of this. The Long Hall, with its 480-feet length, had only one purpose: to keep the people small. Architecture was, most of all, a means of mass suggestion. Like the Lustgarten, many city areas were turned to stone to provide roll-call areas. The death of the young heroes was also effectively staged with the Langemarckhalle, which was the Hall of Remembrance (see no. 236). At the same time, almost as a sign of the preparations for war, barracks, comradeship, invalid residential areas and other paramilitary buildings were also built (see nos. 251, 254, 255).
The National Socialist quest for a public demonstration of power and selfportrayal culminated in the “new design plans” for the world capital “Germania” projected by Albert Speer “on the ideas of the Führer”, which Speer was commissioned with in 1937. A gigantic, almost 1,000-feet wide and 4.4-miles long Via Triumphalis flanked by monumental buildings was to be built as a north-south axis through Berlin. It was to have its exit in the south through a gigantic arch of triumph and lead to a huge 950-feet high dome hall with space for 180,000 people - the ""biggest building in the world”. The reconstruction was to be finished in 1950 and Berlin renamed “Germania”: a gigantomaniacally oversimplified city which symbolised the ""imperial perspective of the world domination being strived for” (Wolfgang Schache). However, the outbreak of war ended the demolition work which had already begun. Despite the total defeat of the National Socialist regime, the principle of city destruction continued in post-war Germany - even if it was under different signs.",,,National Socialism: 1933-1945,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,

It is considered an attempt to connect social requirements in terms of mass residential construction with design elements. Through the rationalization of the building process, the procedures in the construction of buildings were to be accelerated in order to provide as many people as possible in the shortest possible time with a newly built apartment - with the comfort of heating, running water and an inside toilet. On top of this was the aesthetic and ideological requirement to provide the simple workers and farmers with housing which would contribute to an area-wide visual improvement of the cities. The industrial prefabrication was pushed on so far that even special building parts were not produced on location at the construction site but instead already beforehand In the manufacturing facilities.
In the GDR it was Hans Schmidt who, in the mid-1950s as the main architect at the Institute for Standardization, compiled theoretical principles which found recognition in the entire Eastern Block. Schmidt had already attracted attention back in 1924 as the publisher of the magazine ABC - Contributions to Building. He was convinced that the “new architecture could grow only on the technical basis of industrialization and on the social basis of socialism” and propagated the design of buildings from industrially prefabricated components or even the assembly of repetitive facade elements as an architectural principle. Among his German colleagues, who still felt fully associated with neo-traditionalism at the time, the born Swiss was greeted with the head shaking and rejection at first. Nevertheless, with his theses, Hans Schmidt was able to initiate a development in the GDR which influenced the entire Eastern Block. The idea of saving time and, in particular, money from the rationalization of the building process became the ideology of an entire generation of architects. According to Schmidt’s ideas, the architects should learn in particular during their education to implement the “architecturally-conditional tectonics of industrial construction” in their designs. This is because the clear, simple and uniform correspond the best with the essence of socialistic society. But the repeatedly formulated demand to also help form an assumed new society with a new building process could be solved by the architects only with politically extremely high-ranking prototype residential areas. Material shortages and lack of workers, caused by erroneous calculations in the central plans of a rigid party and state apparatus, ultimately led to the fact that the idea of an area-wide architectural renewal of society ended in an economic and creative disaster.",,,Post Modern Period: 1979-1989,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,

However, even the search for a suitable plot proved extremely difficult.

An initial competition in 1872 resulted in no decision being made, the second (only open to German architects) was won by the Frankfurt architect Paul Wallot. Where the other designs were characterised by academic historicism, Wallot employed elements from the Italian High Renaissance and motifs from the ancient world to create a “synthetic Reich style” (Tilmann Buddensieg). With the steel and glass dome, Wallot also indicated a grasp of the contemporary technical options at his disposal. Kaiser Wilhelm II followed the process of construction with a critical eye, and not only because of this dome, which represented competition to the dome of the Schloss. The cube shaped building was considered unfortunately sited, due to having its “back"" to the city centre, and comprised two inner courtyards. The compact corner towers, rising above the building, give it a bulky appearance. The two-storey main front is divided up by column porticos and colossal order with three quarter columns, with the remainder of the facade over three storeys. It was not until 1916 that Peter Behrens' inscription “Dem deutschen Volke”, literally “for the German people”, was added. The Reichstag was heavily damaged in the Second World War, with the dome, which threatened to collapse, later demolished. In the 1960s, the structure was reconstructed by Paul Baumgarten as a building for meetings of parliamentary parties and committees of the German Bundestag, with almost all of the remaining historic interior destroyed and replaced with extremely plain, modern elements. The majority of the rich sculpture work on the exterior was also removed. After the fall of the Wall, there was a new, fundamental reconstruction of the building, including a new dome, by Sir Norman Foster (no. 445).

"Ackerstraße 132, Berlin",52.53642,13.38773,Architecture,3,FALSE,The Berlin Tenement House,Concept,,,"In spite of the destruction wrought by war and demolition, the visage of a large portion of inner-city Berlin remains heavily influenced by one type of building: the Berlin apartment block.
The origins of the building lie in the 18th century, where landowners began to develop rear courtyards for residential purposes. Over the course of time, side wings were added on. The later construction of apartment blocks adopted the pattern of erecting a front building with side wings and cross buildings. As the apartment block represented almost the sole form of housing in the 19th century, the result was the mixture of varied social classes in front and rear house that was so typical for the city.
The overwhelming majority of Berlin apartment blocks were constructed during the period of breakneck growth experienced by the city in the last two decades of the 19th century. Their form was greatly influenced by the Hobrecht Plan (1862, see no. 74), which specified the street plans and the minimum size of the courtyards. By 1887, these were only required to be 17.40 x 17.40 feet in size. This was sufficient for the wagons of the fire brigade to be able to turn around. As a consequence, Berlin had the highest population density of all European metropolises. Living conditions in the overcrowded, often squalid apartment blocks were soon subjected to heavy criticism from contemporary sources. The urban hostility of the Modernist movement has many of its roots here. It was not until 1925 that side and cross wings were outlawed in the new building ordinance.
In layout and comfort, apartments varied from district to district. Where working class districts had more courtyards behind one another and extremely small apartments, in Charlottenburg or Wilmersdorf, large middle class houses were erected with green courtyards and apartments with more than a dozen rooms (see no. 145). The height of the floors also varied. The older apartment blocks exhibit strictly patterned facades, whereas road fronts were later vitalised with balconies and bay windows. Depending on taste, they were decorated in Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque or a mixture of styles.
Following the Second World War, one of the primary objectives of the urban planners was to replace the much-criticised apartment blocks with modern, new' apartments. In the course of the Kahlschlagsanierung, the process of razing entire areas, in the 1960s and 1970s entire districts were torn down. This ignored the fact that many inhabitants actually liked living in their old apartments and only wished for modernised kitchens, bathrooms and heating (see IBA no. 355). Older apartments renovated in this fashion remain among the most popular forms of housing amongst all sectors of the population to this day. The century-old floor plans have proved their extreme flexibility over the course of the years.
The vastly predominant form of living in the 19th century: the tenement house.
One of the saddest chapters in the construction history of Berlin is the “de-stucco-ing” of the tenement houses. In the 1960s and 1970s, in both East and West, around three quarters of all old housing stock buildings had their facade stucco hacked off - with the perpetrators both housing associations and private owners. Reasons included a belief that a “simplified” facade would be cheaper to maintain, as well as ideological reasons: the stucco was a relict of an abominable era. The architect of the Philharmonie (no. 307), Hans Scharoun (no. 281), formulated it thus: “The stucco on the walls is the stucco in our heads.” No other city treated its historic substance with such a degree of harshness. rh",,,Historicism: 1871-1918,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,
"Huttenstraße 12-19, Berlin",52.528196,13.32383,Architecture,3,FALSE,The Cathedrals of Work,_,,_,"The first industrial companies in Berlin emerged at the Beginning of the 19th century to the north of the Oranienburger Tor, along Chausseestraße. The district was known as ""Fireland"", due to the furnaces and smoking chimneys. One of the first large factories to be established here was the Maschinenbauanstalt August Borsig, an engineering company, founded in 1837. The development of the electrical industry in Berlin was even more dynamic. In 1837 the company Siemens & Halske began production in Kreuzberg. The M. Weber plant in Chausseestraße was also to later play a significant role in the development of electrical engineering: in 1867 it was purchased by Emil Rathenau and later renamed “Allgemeine Elektricitats-Gesellschaft” (AEG).
By the 1860s, the new residential districts were already clustering tightly around the production workshops. There were few possibilities to expand the sites in their original locations. Consequently, with the growth of the industry the companies often moved to the peripheral areas of the city. A cluster of industry grew up in Wedding, to the north, with the AEG plant, and later on the upper Spree in Schoneweide. The Borsig plants moved to Tegel, Siemens & Halske, while Loewe moved to Spandau, later also expanding down the Spree in Oberschoneweide.
A key figure in the development of industrial architecture as an independent form was the entrepreneur Emil Rathenau. The design of the new factory in AckerstraBe (see no. 110) was not entrusted to the company's own architects, but handed to Franz Schwrechten, one of the best-known architects of the time. In 1907, he not only entrusted the less well-known architect Peter Behrens with the AEG structure, but also with the design of important product lines and even the company stationary - an unparalleled position, and the harbinger of what was later to become known as Corporate Design. Two years later, Behrens erected his first factory building, the groundbreaking AEG turbine hall in Moabit (no. 151).
In his industrial buildings, Behrens sought to combine ""serial opportunities of neo-Classicist form with the industrial requirements of standardisation"". The principle of arrangement in colossal order is seen most clearly in the front of the small-power motor factory in Voltastraße, where a column front was repeated over four sections between 1910-13, taking its form from Schinkel's Altes Museum (no. 62). The tectonic assembly of the facade was accentuated by Behrens by cladding the steel joists with clinker stone. Large window surfaces enabled copious amounts of light to enter the shop floors. This procedure was adopted by Alfred Grenander in his industrial administration buildings, such as the Loewe armaments factory in Moabit or the Knorr brakes plant in Friedrichshain. The melting together of Classical forms with new steel and glass construction techniques led to the creation of the new “cathedrals of work"".
The industrial complexes of the Gründerzeit era and early Modern age continue to characterise many districts of Berlin to this day. After reunification, their powerful architecture and the open, flexible floor plans made them particular attractive real estate for companies in the fields of the New Economy, design and modern services.
At the birthplace of Berlin industry, north of the Oranienburger Tor, stands a unique administrative building of the Borsig company, erected in 1899: ChausseestraBe 13. In a partially preserved former locomotive factory between Chausseestraße and Novalisstraße, many young companies from the media and advertising sectors have it made their home.",,,Historicism: 1871-1918,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,

Work began on the prestigious project directly after the coronation of Friedrich II. The king wished to express his concept of the state as a tightly knit unit of monarchy, art and science in the form of a construction project on Unter den Linden. The king himself drew up the plans for an opera house, academy building and royal palace, with the plans further developed by his favoured architect, Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff. Of the original plans, only the opera house actually came to fruit, built by Knobelsdorff in Classicist style between 1741-43 (see no. 27). Today, the group of buildings presents less of a uniform appearance than was originally intended by Friedrich II and Knobelsdorff.
St.-Hedwigs-Kathedrale (no. 33) was built in 1747 for the Catholic community, at an angle to the Forum. Its purpose was for Friedrich II to establish a symbol of religious freedom. One year later, on the site of the planned royal palace to the north of Unter den Linden Johann Boumann began construction of a palace for Prince Heinrich. The plans for this were provided by Friedrich II and Knobelsdorff. In 1810 the building became the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Universitat, the present-day Humboldt University. The rear wing of the university building was added by the counsellor for construction Ludwig Hoffmann (no. 141) between 1913 andl919, with the pattern of the Baroque facade simply further extended.
Where once the academy was to stand, the Konigliche Bibliothek (no. 171) was built, to plans of Friedrich II, with construction beginning in 1755. The King based his idea upon a fifty-year old plan by Fischer von Erlach for the Vienna Hofburg. An unfortunate choice, as the sweeping construction bears no relation to the opera house and does not go with the more severe form of the rectangular Forum.
Following heavy damage in the Second World War, the entire Forum was reconstructed in the GDR era, largely true to original, as least as far as the exterior is concerned. The interior of the Hedwigs-Kathedrale, the Alte Bibliothek and the Humboldt University were redesigned in modern style.
In 1995, in the centre of present-day Bebelplatz, the Israeli artist Micha Ull-man created a memorial in memory of the book burnings of the National Socialists on this spot in 1933. A glass plate offers a view into an underground room, illuminated at night, with empty bookshelves.
Around the monument, an underground car park has been built beneath the square, which was once a green space. The planning of the car park drew heavy criticism from a number of artists.""",,,Baroque: 1600-1790,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,
"Pragerplatz, Berlin",52.4929459,13.333031,Architecture,3,FALSE,The International Building Exhibition 1984/87,Concept,,,"As a result of the International Building Exhibition (IBA), approximately 4,000 publicly funded apartments and their infrastructure had been newly built. In the same way, many were repaired and a good dozen empty factories were reused as culture factories, in backyards greenery was planted and parks were created. Even if this only represented, at best, a fraction of what was built in the walled city of Berlin during this time, the IBA became the most important architecture project of the 1980s in the world.
Clear priority settings contributed to the success of the IBA: the Berlin Senate had sanctioned its programme as the ""‘inner city as residential estate”. Subsequently, the IBA invested more than three billion Deutschmarks in the parts of the city, which the Berlin building policy had neglected in the post-war period. In over 160 individual projects, new city building concepts, which had only been realized as prototypes at best until then, were used for the first time on a broader front.
Hardt-Waltherr Hämer started a change of thought As the director of the Altbau-IBA, which carried out the refurbishment of old buildings in Berlin, he faced up to the social present of the city in the east of Kreuzberg. He viewed the colorful mix of squatters, Turks and other fringe groups, who lived there and had been considered as part of the problem up to then, much more as part of the solution. He backed self-help, which made those concerned into property owners. In the course of the “Careful Urban Renewal”, which he implemented instead of wholesale redevelopment, he succeeded in maintaining all the old buildings.
On the other hand, Josef Paul Kleihues (see no. 356), the director of the IBA-Neubau, the section of the IBA which carried out new development in Berlin, focused on western Kreuzberg, the Tiergarten district, Prager Platz and the Tegel Harbour, by rehabilitating the historical city structure, which had only been amputated over four decades, into the future model. In accordance with the method of “Critical Reconstruction”, which offered compliance to the former plots, alignment and eaves heights, the city, craggy due to war and demolition, was expanded with (mostly post-modern) avant-garde architecture.
Through a multitude of publications as well as through numerous exhibitions and symposiums, which were organised in this context, it was guaranteed that the IBA and its methods were not only discussed by the trade public through-out the entire world, but also that it gained immense popularity with the public at large. He, who had never been past Kreuzberg before, could finally recognize the value of a Gründerzeit remise himself.
In fact, the multiplication effects were enormous, not just for Berlin. Not only that the written-off walled metropolis had caught up with the world level in the field of architecture. The city and its history were generally rediscovered. To develop it further instead of breaking with it has become a globally established strategy of urban planning since that time.
In the meantime, the star of the IBA shined so brightly that its failings were barely noticed. What urbanists are happy to label with the buzz word “sustainability” today, obtained at best at that time a formal corset: the IBA city continued to present itself without core functions. Industry, once an obvious part of urban multi-purpose use, continued to move into the industrial estates. This meant, in the end, the then so disapproved-of “sleeping sites of the modern age” were only prettied up into fixed locations which were just as unproductive. Because the IBA only built council apartments, which were then additionally subsidized, it even encouraged the illusion of a continuously progressing all-round welfare.",,,Post Modern Period: 1979-1989,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,
"Pariser Platz, Berlin",52.5162038,13.3782795,Architecture,3,FALSE,The New City of Berlin: Construction Work in the 1990s,Era,,,"The 1990s could hardly have had unified greater contrasts in terms of their urban development role models and economic expectations. While the city’s population was expected to grow to reach a figure of five million citizens, the expectations that were excessive in some cases have markedly calmed down. No one wanted to speak of a booming city ten years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Berlin's population decreased from 1996 onwards, a trend that has only reversed over the last few years. The Senate has incurred follow-up costs, which only future generations will be able to pay off, due to gigantic investments in infrastructure while the tax revenue was absent. Despite this sobering end result Berlin has become a Mecca of modern architecture since Germany’s reunification. You will hardly find any more markedly contrasting philosophies of architecture anywhere else in the world - with the consequence Berlin is extremely polarized in terms of its planning and construction work. Passionate debates have been held about architecture and urban development especially since the reunification of Germany, which has provided Berlin with a surge in development activities that is unique in history. Upon the dismantling of the scaffolding a city has emerged following the boom of the 1990s, which is more modern than many others, which establishes links with long forgotten traditions and has revealed an astonishing level of diversity. In the past ten years numerous architects from all round the world have embarked on a search for a design for the city in competitions. Each of them has made a contribution ensuring that Berlin has found its own architectural style.
The Berlin architecture dispute, which reached its climax between 1993 and 1995 and at the same time also led to personal animosities arising between the architects, created a big stir throughout the world. This is due to the fact that Berlin has always been a trendsetter for contemporary architecture. This raised expectations in the modern architecture to such an extent after 1990 that the response to the reconstruction of city that had been divided for decades had to be a sobering one. Rather than a city idea, which should have imitated the ideals of long since obsolete city utopias, the Senate awarded a prize to designs, which had some elements that are typical Berlin, but which nevertheless regarded as an absolute provocation by the international architecture sector, in numerous competitions and expert reports. Almost without exception the Senate pursued a strategy of “critical reconstruction” during the reconstruction of Berlin in accordance with the role model of a traditional European city. In specific terms this means that the historic city ground plan has to be restored in those places, where it was meaningful from our current perspective. This applies for instance to the areas at the Leipziger Platz, Pariser Platz or in Friedrichstadt a new city structure was developed where there were hardly any relics of the old city, whereby the houses are oriented towards the road, form a clear address and are based on the typology of Berlin's office blocks with their characteristic cullis height of 72 feet. In addition there was the fact - and this really heated the debate up - a fundamental specification for the use of materials: The faces were to be designed in natural stone just like the historical models that they were based on. As a consequence this led to a situation whereby a lot of the raw buildings were integrated quite naturally. Exceptions such as the Galeries Lafayette department store (no. 394) are all the more conspicuous as a result. They form a kind of opposition in the “new centre of stone buildings”.
In addition to the discussion about architectural details Berlin also initiated a series of major urban development policy decisions, which the urban planners had worked towards for almost 80 years as in the case of the Tiergarten tunnel. Berlin fulfilled the dream of a gigantic traffic hub right in the middle of the city centre through the decision to build the Berlin central station and the resulting necessity to create a north-south axis for transport.",,,New Berlin: 1989-Present,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,

The National Socialists made it into an event which will forever be associated with their rule. If with earlier games the event itself, the immediate sporting experience, was the main focus of attention, it was now used as a platform to put the NS state, which had been discredited internationally because of the boycotting of the Jew's and race laws, in a good light, and to demonstrate cultural and economic strength and cosmopolitanism. This meant that for the first time in the history of the Olympic Games, all necessary financial and personnel resources for its implementation were mobilised by the state. However, this expense was possibly not only for a one-off event: Hitler may have already thought at this point in time that, in line with his intention of creating a “Great German Empire”, only one venue came into question for the games: Berlin. With regard to the architecture, the aspect of value creation and therefore the associated question of continued use of the facilities also played a prominent role here. If temporary wooden houses were built to accommodate the athletes in 1932 in Los Angeles, then at the Olympic Village in Dallgow, stone buildings were built which could be reused as barracks.
The architect commissioned with the new buildings, Werner March, who had constructed the nearby Sportforum (see no. 233) in 1928, wanted to use reinforced concrete and glass to build the venues. But Albert Speer (no. 225) revised the plan and had ancient arenas and theatres in mind. The concrete construction was clad in natural stone and was given a strong finishing ledge. March was able to have his way in terms of functionality, though - and he did this so masterfully that the Berlin Olympic Stadium (no. 238) could still be converted today at much less expense than its counterparts in Wembley and Munich.
The Games and their design principle had an effect on the whole city. At a breathtaking pace, which was never to be reached again, the S-Bahn was supplied with electricity, the stations of Zoologischer Garten (no. 228), Schöneberg and Reichssportfeld were reconstructed, as was the tunnel facility of the north-south S-Bahn (no. 252). There were also large infrastructure projects such as the Tempelhof Airport (no. 249). Finally, apart from the exhibition centre (no. 242), many squares and streets were also given a face-lift.
The Olympic Games of 1936 were a complete propaganda success for the NS state, which wanted to present to the world an illusion of normality which no longer existed. Their after-effect was ensured not least by the film director Leni Riefenstahl with her sensational documentary film Olympia in which she glamorised the athleticism in terms of the prevailing aesthetics of the time.",,,National Socialism: 1933-1945,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,
"Alexanderplatz, Berlin",52.5219814,13.413306,Architecture,3,FALSE,The Socialist City Center,The Socialist City Center,,,"No part of the city centre of Berlin has changed less since the Berlin Wall came down than the socialist city centre, Even official planners who still spoke in the plans in 1997 only of one global location idea had difficulties. The reasons are commonly the lack of history and the immense scale. The image of the small, the image of the small compact old town, which had stretched between the Spree Island and Alexanderplatz up to the Second World War, is used as an argument here.
After two thirds of Old Berlin was in ruins after the Second World War, there were, as a consequence, a lot of proposals to relinquish the centralistic city structure forever. The most radical came from Hans Scharoun (no. 281) whose ‘Collective Plan"" aimed to align I Berlin on the glacial valley. Against this, the GDR (in accordance with communist historical philosophy) saw itself as a constitutional product of historical development. In accordance with its principle of ‘socialistic centralism” it insisted on the primacy of the centre. In the year after its foundation, it passed a corresponding construction plan of Kurt Liebknecht : and the reorganization largely adhered to this over three decades.
He assigned the city centre its traditional function as a place of identification for the citizens, a term which was now confined to the working people, however. It was also new that the state instead of the city developed as a patron. This changed world view was to be manifested in a high-rise for party and government which was planned in front of the Red Town Hall in the early 1950s, not at the existent seat of the country's political leadership (the Spree Island). The ideological demands shrank Increasingly during the planning, however. After the East Berlin magistrate and the SED district management had prevented the high-rise, in the place of the city palace, destroyed In 1950, a house of the people was realized in 1976 (Palast der
Republik, no. 337}. An Ideological message was therefore conveyed solely by the finally realized statues at the Marx-Engels-Forum (no. 357) which were hardly of superhuman proportions.
In contrast, the actual dominant building is as clearly urban as politically neutral: the Fernsehturm (no. 322) completed in 1969 centered the city similar to the church or town hall towers of the Middle Ages. The surrounding free space with its tightly formed square walls and purpose-free ground layout also refers to the form of the communal campus of the early modern times. The ""heart of the capital"" therefore represents a historical building achievement of the former GDR.
Even the leap In dimensions represented ultimately only a transformation of the oldest maintained testament from medieval Berlin at the scale of a modern metropolis: at 1,000 by 2,000 feet, the urban free space may be, unmatched throughout Europe. But for the 3.5 million Berliners today, this is about as ample as the 140 by 210 feet of the old “Neue Markt"" which was built at the same location in the early 13th century when the local population was only in the thousands. Only the consistently robust details proved to be system-specific, the apartments, above average in number and consistently designed for average households, and the generally accessible balustrades on department stores and residential houses. The GDR could afford this luxury solely thanks to the socialized land and the intended egalitarian society. In contrast, such a waste of space in pluralistic, market economy-based metropolises has no chance. So the challenge remains to enliven the incomparably large centre on a lasting basis.",,,International Style 1961-1979,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,

The 223-foot tower was built within a timeframe of just two years, based on plans by the architecture office Barkow Leibinger. The fundamental idea behind the design was to generate diversity by using prefabricated asymmetric modules. In order to do this, eight variations of the so-called K-Model were used and then assembled on the load-bearing structure. This method leaves the construction principle of the building shell visible, but also creates a dynamic facade, which has a different appearance depending on how far away you stand and from what direction you look. This evokes the impression that the building is rotating on its axis. The rooms benefit from the floor-to-ceiling glass facade; positioned between the K-modules, this draws plenty of light into the tower and offers spectacular views, while the concrete used for the expressive facade provides insulation and protection from the sun. The volume bends slightly in order to reduce the solid character of the vertical tower. The two-story tower base hides an inner courtyard, which also functions as a throughway for pedestrians and thus opens the building up to its surroundings. Access to the entrance lobby of the office tower is also via this courtyard.

"Hufeisensiedlung, Berlin",52.4482189,13.4498942,Architecture,3,FALSE,"Weimar Republic, the Metropolis of Berlin in the 1920s",Era,,1918-1933,"The 1920s were characterised by democratic emancipation, unparalleled levels of inflation, technical progress and an upheaval in the fields of art and architecture. However, these were anything but secure times. Until 1923, Germany experienced a level of inflation that had never been witnessed before. The situation only calmed down following the currency reform in 1924. However, the Weimar Republic was once again plunged into crisis towards the end of the 1920s due to the world economic depression.
The economic and political instability had an almost inspirational effect upon the fields of art and architecture. Berlin was the central point between Paris and Moscow. While impulses from the fields of fashion and theatre came from France, the focal point in the young Soviet Union was focused on the fields of painting and architecture. The constructivists joined forces in Moscow. Their utopian designs, in which buildings seem to lose their earthly connection, had their counterpart in Germany. Between 1919 and 1921, the architect Bruno Taut published the Frühlicht (early light) magazine, in which he propagated the new form of architecture. He drew up designs for buildings under the title of “Alpine Architektur”, which were copies of crystals as it were. The Bauhaus style of architecture was founded in Weimar, which would develop a new type of architecture for a new society from there. However, hardly any building work was carried out due to the economic situation. Only the young architect Erich Mendelsohn managed to build the so-called Einsteinturm, an architectural envelopment of a solar telescope, in Potsdam.
It was only from the middle of the 1920s that the long yearned for construction boom in the Weimar Republic began. The new commissions included the following: residential estates (see no. 194), high-rise buildings, sports complexes, film palaces, filling stations, airports - technical progress demands new types of buildings. The 1920s began in a very utopian manner, yet the first buildings were very conventional. Only ideology remained. “Our age is not full of pathos; we do not value the great leap forward but rather reason and functionalism” is how the architect Mies van der
Rohe expressed this idea. The greatest challenge constituted the construction of housing for the completely overpopulated cities. Berlin became a centre of council housing buildings.
In architectural terms, Berlin experienced a boom in architecture, which would only be repeated again 70 years later. The engine behind the urban development was the state, which created the basis for the expansion of the city through large infrastructure projects (the extension of the underground and S-Bahn railways, the Tempelhof Airport (no. 249), power and water supply buildings. Berlin was on the brink of being promoted into the Premier League of world architecture. A competition was announced for a high-rise office building at the Bahnhof Friedrichstraße, at the same time as a competition for the new construction of a high-rise building of the “Chicago Tribune"" in which 263 architects throughout the world took part. While a Gothicised draft, typical of the time was selected and realised in Chicago, the realisation of the project in Berlin became the victim of inflation. The most significant projects of this age were realised by architects in the form of detached houses and mansions for major industrialists. They did not embark on the social task of building economical housing for the masses until the second half of the 1920s.
The 1920s also revealed themselves to be extremely heterogeneous in terms of historical architectural styles. While the early projects were still characterised by expressionist styles, the “new objectivity” is beginning to assert itself, which for its part was replaced by a certain degree of recourse to more traditional construction forms towards the end of the 1920s. Within a period of ten years, the architecture in Berlin had developed a degree of diversity, on which it still thrives today.        
A consequence of this period of upheaval was a fundamental alteration of the visage of the city. Within the space of Just a few decades, the historic city centre and Tiergarten (no. 60) were surrounded by an enormous ring of tenement districts (no. 113), with numerous churches, schools, hospitals, public baths and public parks. In 1873, work began on a new sewer network, to plans by the construction counsellor James Hobrecht (no. 74), supported by the doctor and politician Rudolf Virchow. This sewer system is still in functional use today. At the turn of the century the “world’s largest tenement district” was both one of the healthiest and cleanest major cities in Europe. The architecture of the municipal buildings was influenced heavily around the turn of the century by Ludwig Hoffmann (no. 141), who was construction counsellor in Berlin for a period of almost 30 years.
The middle classes were attracted primarily to the “Neuer Westen”, the centre of which became established in the neo-Romanesque district around the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedachtniskirche (no. 107). The Kurfürstendamm (no. 145) was laid out to a width of 177 feet, and was soon flanked on either side by ostentatious residential buildings. Wilmersdorf and Schoneberg also saw breathtaking growth in new street networks, interspersed with decorative squares (see Viktoria-Luise-Platz no. 120). The centre of the city saw the addition of two poorly-situated Wilhelminian state buildings, the Reichstag building (no. 106) and the Berliner Dom.
The drive for the decorative saw a blooming of the city. Every unused space, every green area was decorated with sculptures from the school of Berliner Realismus. The most famous sculptor of the time was Reinhold Begas, whose works included the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Denkmal memorial at the Schlossfreiheit, demolished after the war along with the Berlin Stadtschloss (no. 7).
The first lines for the over ground and underground urban railways were built. Before the gates of the former city walls, a ring of railway stations, port facilities, city canals, slaughterhouses and giant factories grew. In 1882, the first electric arc lamps were fitted in Leipziger Straße and on Potsdamer Platz, three years later the first large municipal power station entered into operation.
In 1910, the capital held an urban planning competition (no. 157), covering a much larger area than the municipal area, which by 1920 had reached the borders that it occupies today. This was the first attempt to plan the Greater Berlin area.
No other European metropolis had investigated this theme at such an early stage.
At the same time, in Berlin in the early years of the 20th century (similarly to the beginning of the 19th century), a new architectural form of European influence took shape: Alfred Messel designed his large department stores (of which no single example remains today (see no. 126, 137)) and Peter Behrens built the famous turbine hall for AEG (no. 151).
These novelties are often described as a “preliminary stage” for the Modernist era of the 1920s. For the Berlin architectural historian Julius Posener, in contrast, this evaluation is an inadequate one. He notes that, “this era ... has its own colour and its own value”, and, moreover, “that the years up to 1918 were the decisive ones”.",,,Early Modernism: 1918-1933,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,Berlin - The Architecture Guide by Philipp Meuser,,,,

",,,"Udo Lindenberg – rocking for world peace
No sign of a rock star? It was the same for the crowds who flocked to catch sight of Udo Lindenberg on 25 October 1983. The Palast der Republik used to stand right here, where the Humboldt Forum is now being built. But if you were critical of the regime you weren't allowed in - a tall order for rock fans.

The fact that Udo Lindenberg is allowed to play East Berlin as part of his Panik tour is something of a miracle. The committed pacifist turned the Socialist Unity Party of Germany against him with his song Sonderzug nach Pankow (Special Train to Pankow). ""Honni"", his ironic name for East Germany's leader Honecker, did not respond to his advances. It was even forbidden to disseminate the song's lyrics and two ""record entertainers"", as DJs were known in the GDR, were arrested by the Stasi.  

Re: A yodelling licence for the GDR  

But Lindenberg refuses to give up. He writes a letter to Honecker with the subject line ""A yodelling licence for the GDR"". He says the song is a declaration of love for the German Democratic Republic. And he appeals to Honecker as one musician to another. In his youth, the East German leader had played drums in the brass band of the Rot-Front-Kämpferbund, a communist paramilitary organisation. Lindenberg's apology is accepted and, after much negotiation, the regime invites him to play at a Free German Youth (FDJ) festival aimed at promoting world peace.  

This is a dream come true for Lindenberg - not only has he been given permission to sing, but it also makes a statement against the arms race, at a time when the Cold War has hit new depths because of plans to deploy American missiles in Western Europe.

The many lights that give the Palast der Republik the nickname ""Erich's lamp shop"" illuminate a conformist sea of blue FDJ shirts. The real Lindenberg fans have been standing outside for hours, chanting ""Udo, Udo!"" Fortunately, their idol comes out of the stage door during the press conference and greets his adoring fans. They scream, clap and even hoist Lindenberg onto their shoulders. And the 650 police officers and 1,615 Stasi employees? They are overwhelmed by the wave of excitement and are struggling to get the situation under control.  

But there's no sign of such euphoria when he returns inside to play his show. Afterwards, Lindenberg says it was like playing to stuffed animals. But, as promised, he sings Sonderzug nach Pankow, the song that has become a ""secret GDR anthem"".

We all love to imagine what life will be like in the future. What food will we eat? What will our homes be like? What new technologies will be invented? And how will they improve our lives? You will soon be able to find the answers to these questions right in the heart of Berlin.

The area around Berlin's central station has sprouted many new buildings over recent years. But when you walk along the Spree looking for the Futurium you'll find it's easy to spot. The futuristic cube stands amongst the modern office blocks with its facade of metal reflectors and ceramic-printed cast glass. As you approach the building, the constant play of light on its outer skin makes you wonder: is this what buildings will look like in future? 

A place for exhibitions and encounters  

The Futurium is hard to pin down. It has been described as a project initiative, an exhibition centre, a place for encounters, a place for dialogue. Perhaps the best description is ""a centre for shaping the future"". The fact that it doesn't fit into any one category highlights the originality of this new concept.  

It has been an unusual project right from the start, involving a mix of public and private sponsors, including the German government, leading foundations, scientific organisations and businesses. And it's also no coincidence that this ""minimum-energy building"" is right next to the Federal Ministry of Education and Research. The German government wants the Futurium to encourage everyone - but particularly the younger generation - to think about the world of tomorrow.   

Could insects be the food of the future?   

The centre will officially open in spring 2019 with a major, changing exhibition on what technology, nature and society could look like in the years to come. The Futurium Lab will be an interactive space where visitors can try out new technologies like 3D printers and laser cutters. And then there's the test kitchen, where you can find out whether you might enjoy tucking into insects in a few years' time!  

The Futurium will be a unique, exciting mix of museum, laboratory and playground. The creators of the Futurium are seeking to inspire, inform and entertain. But they also have a serious message: we can always shape the future. And soon we'll be doing it in Berlin too.

A pleasure steamer carrying potential investors in the Mediaspree project is trying to sail past the wasteland between the Jannowitz and Elsen bridges. But its way is blocked by dozens of demonstrators in rubber dinghies and canoes, all drumming, dancing and singing. They are not just an isolated group of protesters. They represent a whole movement that is fighting to save this piece of land. After years of toing and froing, the campaigners are victorious. The site will become the home of the creative Holzmarkt project.

Today, the Down with the Mediaspree! battle cry is but a distant echo. But the fact that this area is so vibrant today is thanks to those committed residents who spent years campaigning to save the land from developers. In a 2008 referendum, 87% of residents voted against the high-profile Mediaspree project. 

Today, the people of Berlin are still not prepared to stand idly by as their city is sold off piecemeal.  

Public spaces are vital   

The initiators of the Holzmarkt project understand this. Many of them were involved in the protests from the start. They are interested in alternative forms of social and ecological urban development, where decisions about the future are not taken by speculators but by committed local residents. To help turn their visions into reality, local people joined forces to set up a cooperative, which leases out the land that was previously purchased from Abendrot, a Swiss pension fund.   

The city in miniature 

""The Holzmarkt is like Berlin. It has the same qualities that make our city loved and sometimes envied around the world"" says the Holzmarkt information brochure. As soon as you set foot on the site you can see what they mean. It's a crazy little universe that has a little bit of everything: a village square, small artists' workshops and studios, restaurants and bars, a bakery, a day care centre for kids, a wine shop, a brewery, a coffee roastery. Something new is always popping up and blending beautifully into the quirky mix of new buildings, brightly coloured huts and art installations.   

The Mörchenpark green space fits perfectly into this concept. It is the green heart of the Holzmarkt project, and something new is always growing and blossoming there. It is open to anyone who is interested in urban gardening and low-impact living. The vegetable beds, school gardens and other cultivated areas are another step towards living more closely with nature in the heart of the city. Plans are also afoot to create rooftop gardens so that the people who live and work there can be more self-sufficient.  

A decision has not yet been made about what to do with the land on the other side of the railway line that currently splits the Holzmarkt site in two. The plan is to build the Eckwerk, a complex offering affordable rents to craftspeople, artists, creatives and students.

",,,"A carpenter tries to be a property magnate – and fails
Heinrich Brunzel buys the 914-square-metre property at Dunckerstraße 77 in May 1895. The master carpenter is hoping it will be a good investment. He pays a 5% deposit of 3,500 marks and takes out a mortgage on the rest. 

In total, Brunzel forks out 70,880 marks for the building plot. He is looking to build quickly and cheaply so that he can service the loan with rental income, just like the big property companies. They are making fat profits because of the massive demand for housing in the growing city.  

The march of industrialisation brought thousands of workers flocking to Berlin. When the German Reich was founded in 1871, 825,000 people lived in the city. This figure had doubled by 1895. A census taken on 2 December of that year gave the total population as 1,677,304. Smart villas began springing up in areas like Grunewald, and Berlin's characteristic tenements were built to house factory and office workers. You can see them here in Prenzlauer Berg, around Helmholtzplatz.  

Master carpenter Brunzel needs to raise more money to build his apartment block. The lenders impose certain conditions, insisting on front and rear-facing buildings, side wings and a transverse section. Maximum living space for maximum profit - off the backs of people whose wages are barely enough to live on. ""Never before has the need for housing been so unscrupulously turned into a means of generating profit"".  This is how liberal art critic Karl Scheffler later denounces the beneficiaries of the house-building boom.  

Living in barely tolerable conditions 

In the working-class neighbourhoods, people's homes are dark, cold and damp. Trockenwohnen is booming. This is the practice of renting out unfinished apartments in which the cheap lime mortar gives off moisture as it hardens. They are terrible places to live, but for many families it's the only way they can afford a roof over their heads. They stay there for about three months until the walls have dried out and they are required to pay the full rent, then off they go to their next damp building. People who can actually afford dry apartments rent out rooms to maids and day labourers, though this means they and their families have to sleep in a single room.    

Brunzel makes a mistake 

If he's to make his mortgage payments, the master carpenter has to work fast. He's decided to build a brick building with thick mortar joints and wood-beamed ceilings. The first tenants arrive in early 1896, but of course they are paying reduced rents because the building is drying out. Brunzel fights hard to keep his building but ends up losing everything. He is forced to sell Dunckerstraße 77 at auction because he can't make meet his interest payments. This turns out to be a good deal for the new owner, a property company, because the building is now fully let.  

Now you can travel back in time to the 19th century and find out what it was like to live in Brunzel's apartment building and similar tenements in Berlin.

",,,"A shoemaker becomes a folk hero
It's his final caper in a life packed with exploits. When Wilhelm Voigt is buried in his adopted home of Luxembourg in 1922, French soldiers ask for the name of the deceased. The answer ensures that his funeral procession comes complete with military escort: le Capitaine de Coepenick - the Captain of Köpenick.

A star is born. Voigt is granted early release from prison on 16 August 1908 after serving almost two years. He is met with a sea of welcome banners and deluged with requests for autographs. His waxwork even goes on display in the wax museum on Unter den Linden. Voight is whisked from the Tegel penitentiary straight to a recording studio, where, for 200 marks, he records a message of thanks to all his supporters and adds a short prayer of his own: ""I may be free now - but I hope and pray that God will keep me from being an outlaw again."" 

The smartest criminal in the empire 

Impersonating an officer, offences against public order, wrongful imprisonment, serious fraud and forgery - the fact that he's so popular despite his long list of offences is down to the nature of his crimes. Wilhelm Voigt's exploits hold up a mirror to Prussian militarism and the obedience that the military commands. The man in the street is more amused than indignant. Voigt's big adventure begins on 16 October 1906 right where you are now, next to his bronze statue. We are at Köpenick town hall, which he occupies in a surprise coup.

As a former convict, Voigt is not allowed to live in Berlin. This makes it almost impossible for the trained shoemaker to stay on the straight and narrow (and this is later considered a mitigating circumstance). He purchases parts of used captain's uniforms from junk shops and disguises himself as a captain of the Prussian First Guard Regiment. 

Wearing this disguise, he commandeers a troop of guardsmen in Plötzensee. They all take a train to Köpenick. During the journey, the bogus captain buys his men a beer and a bite to eat - and instructs them to ""arrest the mayor and perhaps other gentlemen"" when they get there. 

When they arrive at the town hall, Voigt marches his men into the office of the mayor Georg Langerhans and says he has orders to take him to the New Guardhouse in Berlin. He also confiscates the contents of the town treasury and issues a receipt for 3,557.45 marks (around 22,000 euros), which he signs ""von Malzahn, H.i.1.G.R."" This is the name of his last prison warden, with the addition of the military title ""Captain of the First Guard Regiment"". 

The soldiers commandeer two carriages to take the mayor to Berlin - where nobody is actually expecting them. It slowly dawns on everyone that they have been conned. Pushing through a crowd of onlookers, Captain Voigt leaves the town hall, buys himself a smart new suit in Berlin, and disappears. He is caught ten days later.

It's said that even Kaiser Wilhelm II had a good laugh when he heard about the shoemaker's exploits: ""That's what I call discipline. No other country on earth can match us in that department!""

",,,"A shop window for the dead
Egon Erwin Kisch is no shrinking violet.  This famous roving reporter is always drawn to Berlin's more shadowy corners. In 1925 he visits the morgue in Hannoversche Straße and writes an article on his impressions of Berlin's most macabre attraction.

Right here, at the entrance, the reporter spots a sign saying: ""Morgue open."" When this sign appears on the old brick building it means another set of unidentified corpses is on show. There's no shortage of them in this anonymous city. Up to 14 bodies can be laid out side-by-side in the glass showcases. They are strapped to a table in a semi-upright position so that visitors can identify them.  

Like the zoo 

But they are only rarely identified. Instead, the morgue satisfies the Berliners' morbid curiosity, as the journalist reports: ""Coachmen abandon their carriages in the street, schoolchildren try to sneak in, locals fetch their neighbours from nearby shops and houses to see the free show."" With its glass roof and metal railings, the display area reminds Kisch of the predator house at the zoo. The visitors also behave as if they're at the zoo, describing the dead with typical Berlin bluntness: ""Look at him: he looks like a gorilla!"" 

The morgue even becomes a tourist attraction. Taxi drivers proudly tell visitors to the city that it's a must-see. Sometimes things get out of hand and visitors are forcibly cleared from the display area. This dubious source of entertainment comes to an end in 1931 when the public display area is closed.  

The Republic's morgue  

What the hordes of sightseers don't see is the cellar, which has room for 39 bodies. During the Weimar Republic, this is where autopsies are carried out on prominent citizens who have met with a violent death - including Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, Walther Rathenau and Talaat Pascha. But less well-known people also end up in the Berlin morgue, such as the peace negotiators who were murdered during the occupation of the Vorwärts-building and the victims of the bloody riots of May 1929.  

Today the old morgue in Hannoversche Straße serves a completely different purpose. Since 2007, it has been dedicated to the study of antiquity. But the former display area in the central wing still holds the glass cases that made up this chamber of horrors.
",,"In 2009, Michael Tsokos, head of the Institute of Forensic Sciences at Berlin's Charité hospital, causes a sensation when he claims he has found the body of Rosa Luxemburg in the hospital's basement. He believes someone else was buried in her grave in 1919. But Tsokos' claim is hotly disputed, and the absence of DNA samples means nothing can be proved.

",,,"An attack on the Republic
Just before eleven in the morning, in the upmarket suburb of Grunewald, shots ring out, closely followed by an explosion. It's Saturday, 24 June 1922. The shots are fired at Germany's Foreign Minister, Walther Rathenau. The assassins shoot from a car as it overtakes the Foreign Minister's open-top vehicle on a bend. Rathenau dies in his car, hit by five bullets and a hand grenade.

The murdered minister 

Walther Rathenau was the son of AEG-founder Emil Rathenau, and a member of the company's board. He was also a well-known journalist and keen to be involved in politics. At the start of World War I, he was responsible for organising the war economy at the Prussian War Ministry. After the war he was appointed Minister for Reconstruction, and then Foreign Minister.  

However, Rathenau's views and political actions tend to polarise public opinion. He is regularly the target of severe anti-Semitic attacks by right-wing nationalist groups and the recipient of defamatory letters and death threats. Despite this, he often refuses police protection, as is the case on the day of his assassination. 

The fleeing assassins 

News of the assassination spreads quickly, with all the Berlin newspapers headlining it in their evening editions. The perpetrators are also quickly tracked down. The accomplices and the driver of the car are arrested within a week and the police clarify the sequence of events. But the two shooters are still on the run. A huge manhunt is led by Bernhard Weiß, Vice-President of the Berlin police, but the assassins manage to escape on bikes to Saaleck Castle in what is now Saxony-Anhalt. But the police eventually catch up with student Erwin Kern, who is killed in an exchange of fire, and mechanical engineer Hermann Fischer, who later shoots himself. 

The men behind it 

The subsequent court proceedings were unable to prove what we now know - the three young men in the car were acting on the orders of the Organisation Consul, a monarchist, anti-republican secret society under the leadership of Hermann Ehrhardt. The group made regular attempts to undermine democracy with a series of politically motivated attacks. The secret organisation was also behind the assassination of Centre Party politician Matthias Erzberger and the assassination attempt on Social Democrat Philipp Scheidemann. As far as they are concerned, Rathenau is the ""ideal"" victim - he is a representative of the Republic; they oppose his policy of reconciliation with the victorious Allies; and they hate him because he's Jewish.  

The fall-out from the crime 

But the Organisation Consul fails to achieve the real goal of the assassination - the destabilisation of the Republic. The hoped-for chaos does not break out over the following days and weeks. In fact, supporters of the Republic - at least temporarily - close ranks in the wake of the assassination. Millions of people across Germany join funeral marches and even call a general strike. The newly created Constitutional Court hands down long prison sentences to the surviving accomplices to the murder. Chancellor Joseph Wirth, Centre Party member, sounds more like a Social Democrat in his speech to the Reichstag, saying: ""The enemy is on the right."" 
",,"For the remainder of the Weimar Republic, 24 June is a day of remembrance. As for the Nazis, they join forces with Organisation Consul to erect a memorial to the murderers. In 1946, the Liberal Democratic Party of Germany installs the memorial stone to Walther Rathenau on Koenigsallee.

An exciting match is on the cards. The Hertha team in blue and white are top of the league and bursting with confidence after eleven wins in a row. But they shouldn't underestimate the quality and ambition of their rivals in purple and white. Tennis Borussia (TeBe) are keen to get their revenge for a 6:1 defeat earlier in the season.

On 14 February 1926, 20,000 spectators flock to the Gesundbrunnen district to watch the big match in the ""Plumpe"", the affectionate nickname that Hertha fans have given to their home ground. Hertha takes the lead thanks to a penalty scored by centre forward Hans Grenzel. But the Violets equalise just three minutes later, when Hans Schröder's cross is headed in by Otto Wiese. Hertha's goalkeeper, ""Fredy"" Götze, has no chance. At half-time, it's still one-all. 

Cool, charismatic, successful 

All over Germany, football is growing in popularity, providing an outlet for emotion and aggression. A fan culture emerges that rewards the passion and fighting spirit of the team with fierce loyalty and support. Every weekend the fans make their pilgrimage to the football stadium to cheer on their idols - who work alongside them in the factories from Monday to Friday. Hertha is riding the crest of the football wave. The Blue and Whites merge with the wealthy Berlin SC club in 1923 to create Hertha BSC. This provides the funds to buy the sports ground in Gesundbrunnen and turn it into the city's most modern football stadium. Led by playmaker Johannes ""Hanne"" Sobek, who joins the club before the start of the 1925/26 season, and striker Hans Ruch, the team soon pulls in the crowds. Cool, charismatic, successful, the working-class club - known as the ""old lady"" - has never had a more authentic image. 

The old lady can be fickle 

The second half kicks off at the Plumpe. Six minutes after the restart, Wiese scores again to give the Violets a 2:1 lead. The game has completely turned around. Fast, flat passes, attacks down the wings, unexpected offside traps - everything that the Hertha players normally do so well is simply not working for them today. Reporting on the match, the local press says the Borussia team gained the upper hand because they were ""much fitter"". When ""Bubi"" Völker misses a free kick for Hertha in the 83rd minute and Wilhelm Hoffmann scores a penalty for TeBe, it's all over. The final score is 4:1 to TeBe. 

German Championship final 

In the end, that loss against TeBe turns out to be Hertha's only defeat of the 1925/26 season. They are the undisputed kings of Berlin football. They also reach the final of the German Championship, beating Königsberg, Frankfurt along the way. The semi-final is played at the Deutsches Stadion, where Hertha quickly dispatch the Hamburger SV team with a score of 4:2. But in the final they suffer a resounding defeat at the hands of an excellent Fürth team. But it won't be the last time that Sobek's team make it to the final.

30 January 1933. An icy cold Berlin night. The day when the Nazis seize power. Adolf Hitler has only been Chancellor of Germany for just a few hours. SA and SS units hastily organise a pompous procession, gathering with a mass of torches at the vast Großer Stern roundabout near Tiergarten Park. The marching of the Nazi Brownshirts echoes eerily through the streets.

First house on the left

Around 8pm, the first marchers reach Pariser Platz square. German-Jewish artist Max Liebermann can view the scene directly from his apartment at Pariser Platz 7.

With characteristic bluntness, Liebermann does not mince his words: ""I cannot eat as much as I want to vomit."" For over 40 years, he and his family have been living in his parent's home at Pariser Platz. The house is the work of August Stüler, a well-known student of Berlin's renowned architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel - built at a time when the Brandenburg Gate still marked the city boundary. Once when asked for the address, Liebermann laconically replies: ""First house on your left in Berlin"".

Today, the prominent buildings around include the French Embassy and Hotel Adlon. In his day, German writer Thomas Mann calls Liebermann's house ""a focal and gathering point for refreshing and influential personalities"".   Liebermann builds a glass studio at the top of his house - and the German Emperor tries to ban it for infringing building law. But Liebermann fights for his rights.

For many years, Liebermann dominates the German art world. In 1920, he is even elected President of the Prussian Academy of Arts - the institution he rebelled against in his youth. As leader of the Berlin Secession artists' group, he belongs to the avantgarde. When the Nazis seize power in 1933, Jewish artists are banned from exhibiting. Liebermann resigns from his office as Academy President. Two years later, he dies in his house at Pariser Platz.

The building is destroyed in Allied bombing raids. Today's Max Liebermann Haus is a new post-Wall building, designed by Josef Paul Kleihues, and inspired by the historical original. Since 2000, this has housed the Stiftung Brandenburger Tor (Brandenburg Gate Foundation). In Liebermann's spirit, the Foundation supports artistic projects. Why not visit and see for yourself!

Summer residence on Wannsee lake

In 1909, Max Liebermann buys a vast plot of land along Berlin's Wannsee lake. Today, surrounded by attractive villas, this is one of the last open lakeside areas. Here, Liebermann builds his summer residence, finished in just a few months. He called it 'my palace on the lake'  - a place where he is exceptionally productive. In the months he spends here with his family every summer, he paints over 200 works. Rather like Monet, he draws his inspiration, above all, from his garden.

And despite the GDR's ""People's Police"" brutally attacking and arresting hundreds of demonstrators over the last days, everyone agrees protests must stay peaceful.

A mass of candles cover the areas outside the Gethsemane Church, flames flickering in a light breeze. The low walls are already coated with melted wax - but the sea of candles continues to grow. Open around the clock, the church in these days is a beacon for all those seeking consolation, refuge and kindred spirits in the peaceful struggle against the East German regime.

If you look up, you'll see the entrance portal of this red brick neo-gothic hall church. Just here, in October 1989 there is a banner with the message ""Be vigilant and pray"" - a reminder of the vigil for those unjustly imprisoned.

A joint call for a demonstration is issued by a spectrum of dissenting groups, from the ecumenical Kirche von Unten to the Weißensee Friedenskreis peace activists and the Umwelt-Bibliothek movement. And with news spreading of the GDR regime arresting peaceful demonstrators in Leipzig, crowds of people come to the church. No one, though, could have guessed the Gethsemane Church is soon going to be the target of a violent police action.

Preaching freedom inside - taking it away outside

The 40th anniversary of the founding of the GDR falls on 7 October. Leaving the church that evening, you are met by a wall of units in uniform, kettling the demonstrators in front of the church. They chant ""We are peaceful"", but their words are ignored. Behind them, police vehicles are already moving into position. The police brutally attack the peaceful crowd, leaving many injured. Over 500 demonstrators are arrested and taken to Rummelsburg remand prison, already full to bursting. The GDR police don't even bother to distinguish between demonstrators and passers-by. Everyone who can escapes into the church, now both a hospital and a place of refuge.

In the church hall, a news information office is hastily set up. There, details and minutes from memory are collected from those injured or attacked. The pastor frees up the telephone line so it can be used as a contact number. From here, information is exchanged on the current political situation in other East German towns and cities. Leipzig, Plauen, Dresden, Magdeburg and Berlin are all peacefully campaigning, side by side, for the release of political prisoners. There are more clashes the next day. But the negotiations with the regime by church representatives and the demonstrators' leaders start to bear fruit. On the streets the gathering crowds chant ""We are the people"" and their peaceful protests can no longer be stopped. 

""A peaceful revolution was something our theory never envisaged,"" said Horst Sindermann, then President of the East German Volkskammer, later. ""We simply didn't expect it - and it left us defenceless"".

",,,"Creativity versus commerce
The mural on Manteuffelstraße in Berlin-Kreuzberg looks like a giant Monopoly board. But there's no Park Lane or Mayfair. There's no free parking either, but at least you don't have to go to jail. Kottbusser Tor, Lausitzer Straße and Oranienplatz are on the board, but they're not for sale. The mural is called Berlin not for sale. 

It all starts in the summer of 2014. In Berlin's Kreuzberg district, a group of young people are poring over a city map. They're not looking for the tastiest doner kebab, the coolest skatepark or the hippest bar. They're looking for places where people are being forced to leave their homes to make way for luxury redevelopment projects. What's the best way to stage a protest? Who does this city actually belong to?  

The side of a house becomes a giant Monopoly board  

It's the start of an extraordinary project. The Orangotango initiative organises a workshop for young people. A map has been produced to illustrate the ongoing process of displacement and gentrification in Kreuzberg. The young activists decide to turn it into a piece of art. The cooperative housing project at Manteuffelstraße 39 in Kreuzberg provides them with an empty firewall. Several graffiti collectives get involved in the neighbourhood project. As you can see, the result is pretty eye-catching!  

The young artists only have one weekend to create their street art. They project the image onto the wall and spray-paint each section, like painting by numbers. The weekend is one big party, with sausages sizzling on the barbecue and plenty of cold drinks. Fresh vegetables are provided by the community garden in the Tempelhofer Feld.  

Passers-by soon realise that that the image on the wall is a Monopoly board! But in this version of the game, no one is striving to build a real estate empire, and nobody is going bust. Quite the opposite, in fact. 

The battle for public spaces 

Each space on the board represents one of the hotspots in the argument about the future of the city. The banks of the river Spree represent the loss of access to water. In Reichenberger Straße, a lift transports cars straight into their owner's luxury apartments.  

But many of the images depict places where people are resisting being squeezed out of their neighbourhoods. There's the Köpi building in Köpenicker Straße, one of the city's last squats, though it has now been legalised. There's the communal garden on Bethaniendamm. And at the end of Görlitzer Park on the former death strip, there's the Wagenburg Lohmühle, a camp and caravan site for drop-outs and dissenters.  

Urban development has already overtaken some of the images. On the mural, the Cuvry urban wasteland still allows public access to the Spree. And an investor is building offices on the spot where ""Reclaim your city"" was once daubed on the giant firewall. So who does this city belong to? Is Berlin just a giant Monopoly board for investors who want everything to be sold off? Some of these questions are answered in the new (2017) version of the young people's city map.
",Freely accessible,"Saving the best for last. Spotlights light up the mural as darkness falls. The graffiti artists are painting an old lady on the edge of the picture. Armed with a spray can, she is spraying the symbol of the squatter movement: a circle crossed by an N-shaped lightning bolt. Resistance is not only for the young.

The panels of the Revolution and the Fall of the Wall exhibition break like waves against the inner courtyard of the Stasi headquarters. The other side of the story is now being hold - here, at the heart of East Germany's powerful surveillance apparatus. The exhibition takes us from the first protests to the Revolution and on to the fall of the Berlin Wall.

The grey architecture of oppression. That's one way of describing the dreary office buildings you see before you. When you look at the former Stasi headquarters from the inner courtyard, it feels like it is towering over you. This is typical of a surveillance state where the individual is subordinated and has to conform. What happens behind the walls and countless faceless windows? Interrogations, violence, reprisals of all kinds. 

This exhibition is dedicated to the brave men and women who stood up to the regime between 1945 and 1989. 

The many faces of the Revolution  

Intellectuals, church leaders, young people, opposition members, dissidents - their faces all look out at at the Stasi headquarters. They taste triumph at last. Their photos and documents seem to say: Look at me. You thought you could silence our voices. But the only thing that is silent is the old, soulless lump of concrete that you once called your headquarters.  

1,300 square metres of peaceful protest  

The exhibition panels cover most of the courtyard at the Stasi HQ. The first part is dedicated to the beginnings of the Revolution. The first people's protests against the communist regime of the GDR and the rest of the Eastern Bloc began on 17 June 1953. 

The protest groups were a mixed bunch. There was the peace movement with its strong ""swords to ploughshares"" symbol, the environmental movement and its subculture, and the regime's active opposition. A community of peaceful freedom fighters began to take shape. 

The second part of the exhibition focuses on the Revolution and sheds light on what happened in the last months, weeks and days before the fall of the Berlin Wall - from the Monday demonstrations in Leipzig to the mobilisation of hundreds of thousands of people on Alexanderplatz. 

The long-awaited turning point, the fall of the Berlin Wall, is the link to the third part of the exhibition, which deals with unity and its consequences. The first free elections, sceptical voices, the new freedom - the exhibition takes us on an authentic journey through history with numerous large-format photos, prints of leaflets and newspaper ads and other recordings.

"Alexanderplatz 2, 10178 Berlin",52.52124,13.41351,History,1,FALSE,Alexanderplatz,"Alexanderplatz is a must to experience a vision of urban life in the roaring twenties
",,,"Open heart surgery
In 1929, German writer Alfred Döblin vividly describes construction work on the square in his bestseller Berlin Alexanderplatz: ""Boom, boom, the steam pile-driver thumps in front of Aschinger's on the Alex. It's one story high, and knocks the rails into the ground as if they were nothing at all."" Döblin's main protagonist Franz Biberkopf, just released from prison, finds it hard to cope with the freedom of a modern metropolis where everything around him is in flux. Here, fiction is a true reflection of reality - Alexanderplatz has always been a place of vibrant change.

In the 1920s, the main impetus for this change comes from Martin Wagner, Berlin's chief city planner. He knows, ""A city square for a metropolis of world rank is no small-town project."" This central square in the poor east of the city is threatening to dissolve into permanent gridlock. Wagner envisages Alexanderplatz as a circulatory system for modern traffic flows. Work begins in 1927 - underground. Here, at depths of up to 12 metres, a new interchange station is constructed for two new tube lines - today's Line 8 from Gesundbrunnen to Neukölln and Line 5 to Friedrichsfelde. With the tube lines laid from the street, this operation is rather like open heart surgery. For five years, Alexanderplatz is transformed into a massive construction site, leaving pedestrians to weave their way across the square on a series of wooden planks.

Alexanderplatz goes American

Chief city planner Martin Wagner wants a vast circular traffic system around Alexanderplatz, regulating the flow of cars and trams. He announces an architectural competition for the new buildings to line the redesigned square, encouraging some of the great names in modernist architecture to take part. But the financing is still not secured. Only when a US consortium of investors shows interest can his plan move forward. Star architect Peter Behrens, designer of many major buildings for industrial giant AEG, is awarded second place in the competition - and ultimately the contact as well.

Behrens first plans a series of skyscrapers of 20 to 30 floors high. In the end, though, he reduces his grand plan to two eight-storey office blocks. Built between 1929 and 1932, those blocks are named Alexander House and Berolina House. They still here today, on either side of the renowned Weltzeituhr - the World Time Clock. Behrens' rigorously symmetrical facades are inspired by the New Objectivity movement. Instead of ornamental elements, he adds two rows of projecting windows on the sides. And visitors to the cafés on the top floors could also enjoy roof terraces, the ideal setting for a concert of swing music. As the local Berliner Tageblatt newspaper noted: ""Both these office and apartment blocks have been built by an American company with American money, and since money is no object, they have also been completed at an American pace."" 

Bread rolls for free

The two blocks designed by Peter Behrens replace two places much loved by the locals. Alexander House is constructed on the site of the old Königstädtische Theater, which housed a branch of the popular Aschinger restaurant and beer-hall chain. All the beers cost the same price - just ten pfennigs. The food is also similarly affordable - and all meals come with unlimited bread rolls for free.

Berolina House is named after a statue of the Berolina, the female personification of Berlin, which formerly stood on the site. The majestic bronze female figure is again put up on Alexanderplatz in 1933. But just eleven years later, in 1944, it is melted down to fuel the war machinery. With the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, Alexanderplatz's urban modernist development is abruptly halted. Yet even today, the two office and apartment blocks by Peter Behrens and the Alexanderplatz tube station recall the hopes and dreams of the 1920s.

",,,"A temporary art work
24 June 1995. Christo und Jeanne-Claude have been fighting for nearly 25 years for their project. No wonder they are proud as they watch specially trained rock climbers fix the last roll of material. At long last, the Wrapped Reichstag is a reality - enclosed entirely in 100,000 square meters of glittering silver fabric.

In 1971, Christo and Jeanne-Claude receive a postcard of Berlin's Reichstag building. It is sent by American journalist Michael S. Cullen, who lives in the city. He writes that he hopes Christo will wrap the Reichstag. At this time, Christo and Jeanne-Claude already have an international reputation. They are fascinated by the idea of wrapping the Reichstag. After all, in the divided city of Berlin, the Reichstag stands directly at the border separating two opposing political systems and is visible from East and West.  

A long road to travel  

Christo and Jeanne-Claude talk to politicians and the authorities in Berlin, refusing to be put off. In the meantime, the artist couple wrap such structures as the Pont Neuf bridge in Paris or surround eleven islands between Miami and Miami beach with pink polypropylene fabric. But they still keep fighting for permission to wrap Berlin's Reichstag. 

With German reunification in 1990, the project gains a new momentum. Germany is gripped by a feeling of a new dawn. The German parliament debates Christo and Jeanne-Claude's proposed art project. For the first time in German history, the elected representatives vote on an art performance. It looks like a close result. Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble voice their objections. Doesn't the project put the dignity of the Reichstag at risk? But finally a majority of German MPs take a different view. The vote goes in favour of the project - the Reichstag is to be wrapped! 

A public festival at the Reichstag 

Work starts on 16 June 1995. Even the process of wrapping the Reichstag is an event. Christo's design does not use scaffolding. A local crowd watches enthralled as 90 rock climbers let down the long rolls of fabric from the roof, fastening them with ropes. It takes seven days to finish this temporary art work. Growing numbers of visitors and locals come to marvel at the Wrapped Reichstag, soon a favourite subject for photographers.  

Where you are now standing, there was a truly magical mood. During those summer days, the square quickly turns into a spontaneous festival, with people on the lawn, barbecuing, making music and playing football. For two weeks, the Wrapped Reichstag seems to emanate peace and joy across the city - a festival of art making headlines around the world. This special summer event, attracting over five million people, only has one day of bad weather. Even those, like Wolfgang Schäuble, initially sceptical about the project are converted. When the performance is over, the rolls of fire-resistant aluminised polypropylene are taken down and recycled.  

The Reichstag looks just as always - and yet something is different. Almost as though the glittering material has freed the building from its past. Shortly afterwards, British architect Norman Foster starts work on refurbishing the Reichstag as the future seat of the German Bundestag. A new chapter begins.

",,,"The Stasi’s central institution of terror
Soviet forces and the GDR both incarcerate political opponents in Berlin-Hohenschönhausen. Far from any legal controls, a top-secret prison is set up where inhumane treatment is the order of the day.

No one in the GDR is really free. Yet nowhere are East Germany's citizens further from freedom than in the subterranean bunker-like cells in the Stasi's secret remand prison in Hohenschönhausen.  

The prisoners there dub this damp and cold tract of cells the U-Boot - the ""Submarine"". In the windowless cells, with a light bulb burning 24-hours a day, the prisoners feel as if they are deep under the sea - submerged, lost, beyond help.

When the Ministry of State Security (Stasi) lock Peter Rüegg up here in a U-Boot cell in August 1959, and maltreat him over a period of months, he thinks ""Here, they can do what they like with you.No scream or cry ever escapes these walls."" 

The suffering here begins under the Nazis  

The history of human suffering in Hohenschönhausen goes back to the war years. Even during the Second World War, the Nazi regime packs prisoners into barrack huts on the site of a Nazi welfare organisation canteen.  

When the war ends, the Soviet forces in Berlin turn the former large canteen into their Special Camp No. 3 for political prisoners. Conditions are catastrophic. By 1946, hundreds have died. Afterwards, the Soviet secret police use the site for five years as a remand prison. The feared U-Boot tract of cells also dates from these years. 

If you visit the memorial today, just imagine you would never escape these torture cells. Not only were the prisoners flogged and beaten, but also deprived of sleep or had ice-cold water poured over them. What seems inconceivable today was then the cruellest reality inside these walls.  

Psychological terror replaces physical maltreatment  

In 1951, the Stasi finally takes over the building, turning it into East Germany's top-secret remand prison. Until 1989, over 10,000 men and women are held here. In the late 1950s, the Stasi close the notorious cellar cells. But this does not mean the end of torturing prisoners - just that the methods become subtler.  

Prisoners not only spend long stretches in solitary confinement, but Stasi staff sometimes hold invented phone calls in a prisoner's presence, pretending something dreadful has happened to one of the prisoner's close relatives. For the prisoners, the uncertainty is usually worse than any physical maltreatment.  

Moreover, none of the prisoners in Hohenschönhausen knows where they are. For many of the prisoners, the most worrying question was: Have I been taken out of Germany?  

Only after the Wall comes down does the East German Council of Ministers close all the Stasi remand prisons. On 2 October 1990, just one day before German reunification, the Hohenschönhausen remand prison is finally shut down and placed under West Berlin's legal administration. Yet even today, Siegfried Rataizick, head of the secret prison from 1963 until it closed, denies all accusations. In an interview in 2002, he says: ""I wouldn't miss a single day for the world. I'd do it all again anytime.""

"Tschaikowskistraße 1, 13156 Berlin",52.57775,13.40345,History,1,FALSE,The Central Round Table of the GDR,"Enemies around the table: the GDR grassroots opposition negotiates with state representatives as equals
",,,"Discussions to strengthen freedom
The objectives of the opposition movements are clear: dissolving the Stasi, free elections and a democratic constitution for East Germany. They finally succeed in sitting around a table with the Communist state organisations - but are overtaken by the speed of events.

On 7 December 1989, a dense crowd of journalists and camera teams gathers on the pavement just where you are standing now. Thirty-three men and women push their way through the media crowds, heading for the Dietrich Bonhoeffer House, at that time the community centre of the Protestant Moravian Church. Once in the building, they take their seats in the assembly hall for the first session of the Central Round Table of the GDR. In fact, though, the tables are arranged in a square.  

After a series of demonstrations and protest actions, the popular citizens' movements finally succeed in meeting GDR state representatives for negotiations as equals. The two sides have an equal number of delegates - 15 from the opposition movements, and 15 from the GDR's still ruling Socialist Unity Party along with its block parties. Three church representatives are present to moderate the meeting and keep it on track. Under the large decorative star for the Advent season, the representatives of the people put their demands on the table.  

The end of the Stasi 

The grassroots representatives know exactly what they want to achieve: ""The participants in the Round Table are meeting out of their profound concern for our crisis-ridden country, for its independence, and its long-term development."" Their declared goal is to prepare for free and democratic elections - and ensure the dissolution of the Ministry for State Security with immediate effect. But that's a demand which the leaders of the Socialist Unity Party (SED) and the Politburo find hard to swallow.  

Through emissaries Gregor Gysi and Wolfgang Berghofer, the new Communist premier Hans Modrow proposes that the Round Table should tackle the task of founding a new agency for internal security - to protect against fascist tendencies. But the opposition members soon expose the suggestion for what it is - just keeping the old Stasi in a new guise. Representatives of the New Forum, one of East Germany's most influential grassroots movements, discuss the topic with a directness that unsettles the church officials presiding over the meeting. At this time, though, they are not yet aware of the extent of Stasi surveillance. This conflict come to a head in further demonstrations, and Modrow can only defuse the situation by promising to abandon his plan of setting up a new intelligence agency.  

Fast forward to free elections  

The representatives of the GDR opposition groups at the Central Round Table meetings are unable to achieve their top priority. Inspired by the desire to pave the way for their country into democracy and freedom, they envision drafting a new constitution. Although work begins on the draft, it remains incomplete. With the first free elections to the Volkskammer (People's Chamber) brought forward to 18 March 1990, the Round Table, which is not an elected body, becomes superfluous. What happens to the country afterwards is then in the hands of the first and only freely elected government of the GDR, the German Democratic Republic.

Perhaps you're one of the lucky ones who has made it into Berghain today. When you step inside the temple of techno, be careful what you do with your phone.

It's not a place for show-offs. Nobody gets preferential treatment because they're a celebrity. If you get in, you've joined the clubbing community. It's tolerant. Pretty much anything goes. When you step inside Berghain you're entering a world of intoxication, abandon and ecstasy. 

The best club in the world 

In 2004 the club moved into a former power plant in Friedrichshain. The owners commissioned a firm of designers to strip out and redesign the massive building, which once supplied Stalinallee with power. It gets its name from Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain, the two districts that flank the building - Berg-Hain. In 2009, the British DJ Magazine voted Berghain the best club in the world. International DJs are falling over themselves to get booked. Every weekend, thousands of clubbers hope the bouncers will grace them with their favour.  

Once you've gone through bag check and body check, go up the huge steel staircase. The bass blasts from the speakers in the vast room. There's a corridor to one side. The darker it gets, the more it stinks. Urine or semen? You're approaching the darkroom. Go back. There are more hidden corners and dark corridors. You go up a few steps and are in the Panorama Bar. People are swaying trance-like to the beat, a faint smile on their lips. At sunrise, the huge blinds are opened slightly for a few seconds. Rays of sunlight penetrate the interior. The crowd goes crazy. 

It's 9.30 in the morning. Outside, people are still joining the queue. You can come back later - the club stays open till Monday morning. Clubbing in Berlin has no limits!

",,,"Where freedom and kohlrabi grow side by side
Every shade of green with splashes of tomato reds and yellows - these are the colours of what must surely be Berlin's most beautiful urban jungle. But it's only a little bit wild. The raised beds that are open to everybody are organised in neat rows. And the tiniest of the urban gardeners are buzzing around busily - the garden's bees.

The fact that the bees have found a home here near Moritzplatz is mainly because of the 30,000 people who signed a petition to preserve the Prinzessinnengärten - the Princess Gardens. The city had very different plans in 2009. The state-owned property company that administered this particular piece of land had no interest in seeing it turned into a permanent green space, but it agreed to let the non-profit organisation Nomadisch Grün (Nomadic Green) rent it on a monthly basis. It was due to be sold to an investor in 2012. But the city authorities are taken aback when the people of Kreuzberg decide they are going to fight to keep their communal garden.   

Princesses against privatisation 

They organise protests against the plans, and the lease is extended. But they are still waiting for a final decision by the Senate. In the meantime, local residents set about bringing nature back to the city. They plant organic vegetables and fruit, perennials and trees on the 6,000-square-metre plot.  

Beekeeper Heinz Risse thinks it could be a paradise for bees so he volunteers to look after the bee colonies. He sees his work as a counterweight to industrial beekeeping and agriculture. The result is not only honey but a new awareness about the importance of bees. ""I had to settle into my job of passing on and sharing knowledge in this amazing garden that's unlike anywhere else in the world. I think my biggest challenge is encouraging today's children to ask the right questions. They'll find the answers in their own good time,"" he says. This doesn't only apply to the countless children who come here on school trips, but also to the adults who help with the gardening and harvesting or simply come to enjoy the lovely surroundings.

",,,"Berlin’s beautiful showcase of democracy
The Reichstag dome is not just a stunning piece of architecture. It also symbolises a new era of transparency in German politics. But it was almost never built.

You are about to enter the Reichstag dome, which has become one of Berlin's most famous landmarks. But architect Sir Norman Foster had some very different ideas for it back in the early '90s. He wanted to hang a kind of flat canopy over the whole Reichstag building, but critics said it looked like a giant petrol station. 

Today, when you climb the 40.7 metres to the viewing platform in the Reichstag dome, you are rewarded with incredible views over Berlin. This is all thanks to two political parties - the CDU and CSU - and to Helmut Kohl himself. After reunification, the CDU/CSU Union failed to gain support for its plans to rebuild the historic Reichstag dome, so in the end they agreed to compromise and build a modern dome in glass and steel. 

Foster gives in to the politicians - and creates a masterpiece   

It turns out to be an excellent decision. Because it forces the architect to create an icon, a masterpiece that is famous around the world. For the very first time, a parliament building has been topped with a see-through dome and it open to the public. 

As you climb the two large steel ramps that spiral up to the top of the dome, you can sense the excitement that was triggered by Foster's second design. You are treated to an unparalleled, ever-changing vista. With every step, you get a different view of central Berlin - the Tiergarten, the government district, Potsdamer Platz. 

But Foster's 23-metre-high dome isn't only a feast for the eyes. It is also brimming with high-tech features. At the centre of the dome is a giant cone consisting of 360 mirrors, which catch the daylight and direct it down into the debating chamber. 

Radical symbolism and transparency at the centre of political power  

A computer-controlled sun shield tracks the movement of the sun and blocks the light from individual mirrors to prevent excessive glare. The cone also acts as a vent, drawing stale air out of the debating chamber to an opening at the top of the dome. 

Between 1995 and 1999, Foster and his team installed 800 tons of steel and 3,000 square metres of glass in Germany's state-of-the-art domed structure. And yet the true fascination of the design lies in its radical symbolism. Of all people, it is the Germans, whose Nazi dictatorship led to the greatest political catastrophe of the 20th century, who can now quite literally look down on their parliamentarians. They have created a new kind of transparency at their centre of political power.  

The need to renovate the Reichstag to make it suitable for its current use led to the creation of a beacon of democracy that sends out a message to the world. Today the Reichstag dome is Berlin's most-visited landmark. Attracting some two million visitors a year, it is the supreme symbol of German reunification.

",,,"Dreaming of freedom
The cement in the newly erected Berlin Wall has barely dried. Resistance fighter Rainer Hildebrandt decides he can't stand idly by and watch what the Socialist Unity Party of Germany is up to. People in the West need to know what is happening along this border.

Like many prisoners of the Gestapo (Geheime Staatspolizei), Rainer Hildebrandt has a dream: ""A dream that the cell door opens, the light goes on and a voice says: You're free to go."" The historian and human rights activist has never lost his desire for freedom. 

Keeping an eye on the Wall  

On 19 October 1962 Hildebrandt decides to open an exhibition about the Berlin Wall in his small apartment on Wolliner Strasse. The city's brutal dividing line runs directly in front of these residential buildings. He opens his doors to tourists and anyone who's interested in what is happening on the border. His exhibition proves to be so popular that he relocates it to the Haus am Checkpoint Charlie on 14 June 1963. From being purely a museum, it quickly becomes a focal point for demonstrators, journalists, refugees and escape helpers, who have a perfect view of the checkpoint from its small window. 

But it doesn't escape the authorities that the premises are also being used to plan escapes. Rainer Hildebrandt is subjected to several kidnap attempts, but he allows nothing to distract him from his peaceful fight against injustice. His museum grows with the stories of each new escapee.  

Escaping over, under and through the Wall  

When you see some of the exhibits it's hard to believe your eyes. People escaped by hiding in a car's petrol tank, building a home-made submarine and - in the ""escape of the century"" - two families flew over the wall in a hot air balloon in 1979. The museum also reveals the horror of the border's deadly self-firing weapons, the ruthless border guards, the tragic stories of those who died and suffered at the hands of the regime.

The fall of the Wall is a dream come true for Hildebrandt. He has always longed for ""freedom in unity"", and now it has arrived. And the Haus am Checkpoint Charlie itself becomes a witness to history.  Today the exhibition also covers broader themes, such as non-violent revolutions around the world. 

BlackBox Cold War   

Just a few metres from the Checkpoint Charlie house stands a black cube. This spot, where the American and Soviet tanks met on 22 October 1961, is now the site of a fascinating multimedia exhibition about the Cold War.

They read: ""Look inside your uniform! And if you find a human being in there, give us a wave."". Well-disposed border guards respond by marking their Kalashnikovs with a cross or giving secret hand signals.

",,,"Jazz and a touch of the exotic in Berlin’s West
It's 3am at 10 Joachimsthaler Straße - closing time. Through the door marked with a bright neon sign spelling out KAKADU TANZ, a noisy crowd spills onto the street and heads off into the Berlin night.

Some hail taxis, while others take a turn on Berlin's most prestigious boulevard, the Kurfürstendamm, before heading home. Money talks, and the bars, cafés and cabarets all vie for the attention of the passers-by, whether it's Berlin's bohemian set, visitors from abroad, or German tourists. 

Champagne, champagne - the crazy years 

On the corner of Joachimsthaler Straße and Augsburger Straße, the Kakadu bar is managed by brothers Georg and Dagobert Tichauer. It's a hip place to be, with a daily programme that includes acrobatic dancers, comedy, cabaret, live bands, a vegetarian restaurant on the mezzanine floor and Berlin's longest bar, which stretches 15 metres along the back wall. The bar promises its guests a touch of exoticism. The South Seas-style furniture evokes memories of long-lost colonies. The walls are covered with golden red fabric and the rooms are flooded with rich red light. Meanwhile, the bar provides a striking contrast in shades of blue and gold. 

Hostesses glide around, ensuring their guests are having a good time. They are dressed like ""flappers"", confident young women in loose, sleeveless dresses, who smoke and drink and behave like brash young men. Outside, the economy is in tatters. Inside there is dancing and drinking, flirting and partying. All accompanied by a wild kind of music that is rapidly gaining popularity in the Twenties, but also attracting criticism - jazz. 

The rhythm of the city 

While the Kakadu has a regular house band led by Max Herrnsdorf, it also occasionally puts on a ""Tschetzbend"", or jazz band. Then the dance floor is jumping as guests dance the Charleston and Shimmy. Everybody can have a go because there don't seem to be any fixed dance steps. The guardians of public morals view all this wiggling and shaking with suspicion; they seem to be breaking sexual taboos. But, as Franz Wolfgang Koebner notes as early as 1921, the waltz is ""as good as dead"". In contrast, the jazz bands are alive and kicking - playing music that is fast, eccentric, and loud. The new, modern city dweller rushes everywhere - and jazz rushes with them. 

The bands are brash and noisy, but the Kakadu also puts on more refined jazz ensembles for those with more sophisticated musical tastes. There's a constant coming-and-going at the Kakadu, which is disturbing for local residents. But it's all over at three in the morning. The band plays its last number as the audience call for more. The next day, it all starts again. Until 1936, when it really is all over - forever.
",,"In der Kakadu-Bar sitzen tatsächlich Papageien auf der Stange. Es gibt Berichte darüber, dass diese, wenn ein Gast mit dem Messer an das Glas schlägt, darauf trainiert sind, nach der &bdquo;Rrräächnung!"" zu verlangen. Mitunter landet wohl auch deren Notdurft auf den Tellern von unachtsamen Gästen.

"Unter den Linden 77, 10117 Berlin",52.515833,13.380556,History,1,FALSE,Hotel Adlon,"From pomp on Pariser Platz to desolation in the death zone
",,,"A grand hotel in the shadow of the Berlin Wall
The Hotel Adlon was always the best hotel in the square. More precisely, the best hotel on Pariser Platz, with its view of the Brandenburg Gate. But after the glories of the imperial age and the glamour of the Roaring Twenties, it ends up in ruins.

Baldur hates the colour blue. He has all the blue pens, armchairs and inkpots removed from his room at the Adlon. So what if it's the famous Adlon blue? Of course, the grand hotel bows to the wishes of the Reich's influential youth leader, Baldur von Schirach. 

Because the customer is king at the Adlon - and in the early days they were even emperors. When it opened in 1907, the hotel's first regular guest was none other than Wilhelm II, who preferred the luxurious Adlon to his own residence. Hardly surprising, as Lorenz Adlon had decided to create a luxury hotel for Berlin's high society.  

From magnificence to ruin 

In the Roaring Twenties, the Adlon is known around the world as a meeting place for the rich and famous, but its guest numbers plummet during the Second World War. The hotel's cosmopolitan flavour is not to the National Socialists' taste - they prefer a simple stew to a sophisticated ragout. As the bombs fall on Berlin, the Adlon is miraculously spared.  

So it seems like a bad joke when the hotel is burned to the ground by two Red Army soldiers who break into the wine cellar on 2 May 1945. One of them drops a burning cigarette into the wood shavings - and starts a devastating fire. All that's left of the magnificent building is a rear service wing. 

After the Wall is built in 1961, the German Democratic Republic renovates the hotel and runs it until the early 1980s - but the west-facing windows are walled up. In 1964 the hotel hosts the wedding of stage designer Horst Eilers and dancer Erna Lange. But the happy couple's special day is marred by the police presence at the reception. And the regime only allows them to invite ten guests to this very special location - right next to the death zone.  

Apprentices are occasionally housed in the Adlon building until it is demolished in 1984 on the orders of the SED's Politburo - the Adlon has had its day. 

After the fall of the GDR, the Altstadtbau property developers erect a new building on the site of the former hotel complex, which you can now admire in all its glory. It was opened by German President Roman Herzog on 23 August 1997 as the new Hotel Adlon Kempinski.

",,,"Painted black – iconic graffiti vanishes from sight
It's the night of 12 December 2014. A piece of wasteland in Kreuzberg. Several people are standing on a hydraulic platform covering a huge firewall with black paint. Passers-by stop to watch what's going on. Some have tears in their eyes. Others are simply stunned. Boos and whistles are directed towards the painters who are covering over one of Berlin's most iconic pieces of graffiti. They are erasing one of the icons of the city's street art scene. Who is behind this destruction? Amazingly, it's the artist himself!

He calls himself Blu, hails from Italy and is a famous street artist. In 2007 he selects a huge firewall on Cuvrystraße in Kreuzberg as the site for his latest artwork. He plans to paint a huge mural directly on the wall of the building. He spends several days and nights painting two huge white figures.  

Reclaim your city 

One figure stands upright, the other is upside down. They're pulling at each other's masks in an attempt to see the face underneath. The fingers of their free hands form the letters W and E - West and East.   

In the top right corner are the words ""Reclaim Your City"". The mural is just a few metres from the remains of the Berlin Wall. One year later, Blu paints a headless figure on the adjacent firewall. The faceless businessman wears a gold watch on each wrist, linked together by a chunky gold chain. He's adjusting his tie with his manacled hands. 

These paintings are icons of Berlin's street art scene. The sightseeing buses slow down as they drive past because tourists love the murals. Tour guides bring their groups here to admire these city landmarks.  

Another open space disappears 

When you walk north along Cuvrystraße, you quickly reach the River Spree. The first beach bars opened here in the 1990s. The land on Cuvrystraße changes hands several times - it's ripe for development. But local residents want to keep it for themselves. They set up a protest camp to oppose plans to build the BMW Guggenheim Lab. It's like a favela in the middle of Kreuzberg. People are sleeping in tents and homemade wooden shacks. Eviction notices become part and parcel of daily life. They are fighting to keep one of the last open spaces in Kreuzberg. The police eventually clear the site in September 2014. Then the bulldozers move in and start preparing the land for building the office complex.  

Blu doesn't want his artwork to exist in these surroundings. He doesn't want it to be part of a development that forces people out of their homes to make way for luxury housing that they can't afford. The artist also sees the destruction of his murals as a wake-up call. His art as a symbol of resistance has had its day. ""Reclaim Your City"" is now just ""Your City"". The rest has been painted black.
","Empty plots are developed, and the old firewalls are swallowed up","Just one detail is briefly preserved - the extended middle finger of one of the figures' hands. It stands out starkly against the black background. It is a message from Blu ""to the city, the developers and, above all, to the people who love this piece of art."" Before long, this last vestige of rebellion has also disappeared.

",,,"Street art unleashes creativity
Berlin, 1984. The scaffolding on the corner of Schlesische Straße 7 is being dismantled. Suddenly everyone can see the words: Bonjour tristesse. They are written on the new building designed by architect Siza Vieira. Hello, sadness! No-one knows how the graffiti got there or who painted it. But many people agree with the sentiment when they see the building's dismal façade and monotonous array of windows. Ever since the 1980s, Berlin's graffiti has been a form of communication between the city and its people. Now another example has joined its ranks.

Walls tell stories  

The graffiti movement emerges in the US in the late Seventies. It soon spills over to Europe, accompanied by a wave of hip-hop culture and punk music. West Berlin is ready to soak it up. The city's divided state means everything is politicised, including art. West Berlin offers artists plenty of scope.  

Many buildings have been reduced to rubble during the Second World War, leaving empty spaces punctuated by immense, blank firewalls. These were constructed to protect houses from the spread of flames in the event of fire, but now they provide perfect empty canvases. Graffiti artists use them to tell their stories, big and small, in images and letters. Monotonous facades such as the building by Siza Vieira become a screen for projecting political news.  

The Kreuzberg district is a major draw, not only for its many firewalls, but because it is home to the biggest canvas in the world - the west side of the Wall. In 1976 the GDR border guards begin building a new type of wall. Made of gleaming white slabs, it is an irresistible invitation to artists. They flock to Berlin from far and wide to leave their comments on local and world politics on the Wall. 

In 1986, the Checkpoint Charlie Museum invites top American street artist Keith Haring to come to Berlin. He is given free rein on a hundred-metre section of the Wall, where he paints his vision of a united Germany in black, red and gold.  

Street art and graffiti can also be found in East Berlin. In the district of Marzahn, an artist from Nicaragua is allowed to paint the facades of East Berlin's typical concrete apartment blocks, but the authorities keep him on a tight rein. From time to time, illegal murals also appear around East Berlin, and as the regime crumbles, the Wall is daubed with slogans such as ""Down with the wall of shame"" and ""Freedom - no more SED lies"". This is viewed as subversive activity and punished accordingly.  

The start of a new era  

The fall of the Wall in 1989 heralds a new era for street art and graffiti. Now it's on a roll in East and West alike. Artists from all over the world are drawn to Berlin by events such as the Mural Festival. Today, Berlin is considered the European capital of street art and graffiti.
",,"Bonjour tristesse is no longer alone. In 2012 it was joined by the words BITTE LEBN - please live - written in red to the right of the old graffiti. Here, too, the artist is unknown. But it comes with a trademark sign, the anarchist A.

",,,"The Moabit riots
September 1910 in Moabit - a clerk named Katzmarek is on his way home from work. When he gets off the tram, he's attacked quite out of the blue by baton-wielding policemen. One of them shouts: ""What are you looking at?"" The uniformed officers charge towards him with sabres drawn.

At the same time, writer Erich Mühsam is noting in his diary: ""Encouraging news in Berlin. Workers and women have gathered to confront the strike-breakers at the Moabit coal workers' uprising."" 

Fighting for a few pennies 

The confrontations begin on 19 September 1910. Life is hard for workers because food prices and rents are soaring while wages remain low. Workers at Kupfer coal merchants are fighting for a pay rise from 43 to 50 pfennigs an hour. When management rejects their demands, the workers walk out on 19 September.   

Industrialist Hugo Stinnes tries to keep his company's coal business running, but every day there are angry demonstrations. Stinnes asks the police for help and hires an expert strike-breaker called Hintze. He boasts: ""I can break any strike. In eight days I can have six thousand men here."" His armed strike-breakers eventually arrive on 23 September. This enrages the local residents, who side with the strikers.  

A strike becomes a riot 

Both sides are quick to espouse violence and the strike becomes a bloody battle between picketers and locals on one side and law enforcement and strike-breakers on the other. Police wade into the crowd with their batons, windows are shattered. Stones, bottles and pots rain down. On 25 September, the Kupfer company sends a telegraphs Stinnes, saying: ""It's a full-blown battle."" 

Two days later, Berlin's police superintendent Traugott von Jagow orders his men to use firearms. 30,000 people are out on the streets. On 27 September, his officers fire on the protesters and crush the rebellion. The people of Moabit are defeated and the strike is over.  

The final shot rings out, the angry mob draws back - and an elderly man lies dead in the street. He had left his house to look for his son and been run through with a sabre. The police have attacked him for no reason, just like Katzmarek. Fortunately, the clerk escapes from the police by jumping onto a passing tram.  

The public are agitated about police brutality and the question of who is to blame for the violence. In October, tens of thousands of workers take to the streets in Moabit to protest against police brutality, followed by more demonstrations four weeks later in Wedding. In his diary, Erich Mühsam concludes: ""The whole episode is yet further evidence of something I've known all along: that Berlin workers are the best, the manliest, the most independent and the most libertarian in Germany.""

",,,"The freedom to live wherever you like
East Berlin, 1981. A grey city filled with crumbling buildings. A 27-year-old physicist has recently separated from her husband and is looking for a roof over her head. She finds an empty apartment. The door is locked, so she simply breaks it open and moves in. Her name is Angela Merkel.

But Germany's Chancellor was not a squatter in the classical sense. ""I simply transferred the rent to the state renting agency"", she says later on. Back in the 1980s, Merkel was not the only one to find a home in this unorthodox way. In East Germany, schwarzwohnen - occupying vacant buildings - had become the norm. Merkel occupied two properties, first at Marienstraße 24 and later in Templiner Straße.  

Rents at 1936 levels 

Real socialism has produced a severe housing shortage. The government is busy building prefabricated houses while old buildings in the city centres are derelict. Compulsory nationalisation has led to a shortage of skilled tradesmen. The SED freezes rents at 1936 levels, meaning rents stay low but it is impossible for landlords to cover their costs.  

Even for the state, letting property in the GDR is a loss-maker. There is no money for renovations and existing housing stock becomes uninhabitable. In the early 1970s, 600,000 people are officially looking for housing, and the trend is upwards.  

Many young people choose to take matters into their own hands rather than waiting for the state housing agencies to act. On average, the waiting list for a new apartment is 10 years. Meanwhile, countless buildings are standing empty because they are deemed uninhabitable.  

Move in, then register  

But the younger generation don't care. They are not looking for comfort, they want freedom. Outside toilets, coal stoves, leaky windows and roofs, no showers - nothing puts them off. Many of the occupants carry out repairs themselves and register with the police, so the authorities and other residents tend to tolerate them.  

The young people even voluntarily pay rent, as this increases their chances of staying in the long term. They ask their neighbours for the landlord's bank details and hang on to their receipts. If they are forced to move out of one building, they simply move into another. In this difficult situation, the penalties are limited. Fines are generally low, and evictions are prohibited under GDR civil law. This means that the occupiers often go on to become legal tenants.  

The illegal occupations in East Germany provided people with desperately needed places to live. But they also had a psychological effect. The historian Udo Grashoff describes it as an important act of self-assertion by courageous young people, who were often students or artists. He believes the experience of taking action and discovering that state control has its limits was a key element in building the occupiers' confidence in the political arena. Who is perhaps the best proof of this theory? Angela Merkel.
",,"The Ministry of State Security is better informed about illegal occupations than the authorities, but it often chooses to do nothing. Most of the buildings have not been occupied for political reasons but because of the housing crisis. And in every other case, the Stasi is quite happy to have its opponents under control.

",,,"A treaty violation carved in stone
From their lofty pedestals, the stone eagles gaze fiercely over Wilhelmstraße. A Luftwaffe troop marches past in formation. Minister for Aviation Hermann Göring strides across the forecourt. Curious employees lean out of the windows of his ministry. It is 16 March 1937, the second anniversary of the reintroduction of Germany's right to military rearmament. Göring steps up to the microphone for a radio broadcast and reports on the successful rearmament of Germany's Air Force. This clear violation of the Treaty of Versailles was planned in the building in front of you.

The Ministry of Aviation is established soon after the National Socialists take power. This new ministry is set up to work on building a national air force, one of the key steps to becoming a military superpower. This is prohibited under the Treaty of Versailles. But after two years of secret rearmament, Hitler declares Germany's right to military rearmament at the Nuremberg Reich Party Congress. What he actually means by this is the country's right to rearm in contravention of existing treaties. 

In 1935, the new German Luftwaffe gets its own ministry building on Wilhelmstraße. It is one of the Nazi's first monumental building projects. More than 1,000 workers toil on the construction site, working around the clock in three shifts. An entire city block is demolished and cleared and work on the new Aviation Ministry begins on eight different sites. The reinforced concrete building goes up quickly thanks the latest construction methods. For the Nazis, it is one of the key construction sites of the new era - an expression of their power.  

A building with a chequered history 

You are now standing where Hermann Göring and the architect, Erich Sagebiel, officially opened the building in July 1936, shortly before the opening of the Olympic Games. Imagine two huge imperial eagles on their pedestals and swastika flags flying on the roof. Otherwise, nothing much has changed. Göring is happy with the building. He praises its ""austere lines as an expression of the austere spirit that governs us all today"". With more than 2,000 rooms, the Ministry is one of the biggest office buildings in Europe. But ""Fat Hermann"" is rarely found at work in his Berlin fortress. He doesn't even have a proper office there.  

The state rooms have been preserved to this day. The dark wood panelling of the small banqueting hall has witnessed many stories and occupants over the years. Ironically, the building where the bombing of Europe was planned and organised survived the war largely unscathed. It has remained in uninterrupted use to this day.  

Its thick walls have housed more than 80 years of political history. Göring's Ministry of Aviation was succeeded by the Soviet military administration, then on 7 October 1949 the building provided the location for the GDR's official founding ceremony. It changed its name to the House of Ministries. After the fall of the GDR, the building became the headquarters of the Treuhand, an agency for restructuring East Germany's state-owned industries after reunification. Today, it houses the German Ministry of Finance.

On 30 January 1933, the National Socialists under Hitler seize power in Germany. Officially, the country still has a democratic constitution. On 27 February 1933, it's Carnival Monday. Not only is the weather bitterly cold, but the mood in the city is equally frosty. Shortly after 9pm, sirens are heard in the inner city - the Reichstag, the German parliament building, is on fire! The fire services arrive quickly, but too late to save the building. A fateful night for democracy in Germany. The Reichstag fire comes to symbolise the Nazi seizure of power.

 

The Reichstag is burning 

Just thirty minutes after the fire starts, the core of the building is almost beyond rescue. The Nazis openly disparage the German parliament. For them, it is just a ""talking shop"" - and now the parliament building is in flames. The police find a young Dutchman inside, and arrest him as a prime suspect. His name is Marinus van der Lubbe, a communist supporter. Had he really set fire to this massive building all on his own?  

During his first interrogation, he describes in detail how he set the fire. He climbed through a window on the west side of the Reichstag, setting fire to the curtains, wooden panelling and desks. As he went through the building, he used his shirt as a burning torch. Soon curtains, tapestries, carpets, and tablecloths were all on fire. After less than thirty minutes, van der Lubbe walks straight into the arms of two guards.  

""Let's set to work. Everything's bright. That's what we need!""  Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels is thrilled. The Nazis immediately see the propaganda potential of the Reichstag fire. Now, they have an excuse to eliminate their political opponents. Just a few hours after the fire, they arrest hundreds of Communist party functionaries in Berlin. In the course of the day, Hitler's cabinet suspends basic democratic rights. From now on, anyone can be arrested without specific charges. The Nazis claim the country must be protected against a Communist putsch. The tolerance marking Germany in the 1920s is thrown overboard. There is an end to press freedom and freedom of opinion. President von Hindenburg approves the emergency decree ushering in a wave of terror. The measures under the so-called Reichstag Fire Decree turn Germany into a dictatorship. 

At odds over historical events  

In December 1933, a Leipzig court sentences Marinus van der Lubbe to death for arson and treason. Since then, historians have argued over the Reichstag fire. Did van der Lubbe really set the fire alone? Did he have helpers? Was he working for someone else? And what role did the Nazis play? After all, they profited most from the fire.  

For years, a secret underground tunnel connects the Reichstag with the palatial residence of the Reichstag President - in 1933, Herman Göring. So could Göring have sent his SA or SS henchmen through the tunnel?  No surviving historical documents prove the Nazis were involved in the fire - and even fire experts believe Marinus van der Lubbe could have acted alone.

",,,"A home for life’s castaways
""This palm tree stands on the beach of poverty, and in its shade there is little happiness."" This is how journalist Max Barthel describes the municipal homeless shelter in Fröbelstraße in January 1929. Dating back to imperial times, the brick fortress is feared by most Berliners. Nobody wants to sink so low that they have to sleep at the ""Palm"", as the homeless shelter is called because of the exotic plant that grows at its entrance.

Day in, day out, a long queue of homeless people forms at the shelter, waiting for it to open its doors at 3 o'clock. They are mainly men: ""young lads and old hobos, forced to live as beggars for decades, the derelicts of bourgeois society"". This is how they are described in the communist newspaper, the Red Flag. The queue is also full of people who have ended up on the street because they can't pay their rent. Many of them have simply given up hope.  

Police checks 

In the reception area, it's like a military barracks. The homeless have to salute the staff on duty. Most of them still display the Prussian mentality that equates homelessness with crime. Each new arrival is carefully checked for a criminal record, and the police keep a close eye on the homeless shelter. Anyone who wants a bed for the night has their neck stamped and is told to strip to their underwear so that their clothes can be disinfected in the delousing room. Only then are they given their standard bowl of watery gruel.  

At 10 o'clock, the doors of the ""Palm"" close for the night. That's when the moaning and groaning starts. Up to 70 men can be accommodated in each dormitory at the rear of the shelter. The main building has a few rooms for women and children. When times are tough, more than 5,000 people can be sleeping in the shelter. Fights break out constantly over people's meagre possessions. Sleep is often out of the question. The stench is almost unbearable. 

Into the unknown 

Everyone is kicked out at six the next morning. Most of them don't know what to do or where to go and will end up back in the queue that afternoon. But they can't stay for longer than two weeks. This rule is spelled out to everyone who comes looking for a bed: ""You can only stay here for 14 days. During that time you have to find a job and somewhere to live."" 

For most of them, it's an impossible task. But if they try to stay longer than two weeks they run the risk of being sent to the notorious municipal workhouse in Rummelsburg. Once this happens, they have not only lost their home, but also their freedom.

",,,"Hitler’s megalomania in stone
The floor is smooth as glass. The diplomats carefully place one foot in front of the other, their footsteps echoing through massive rooms that smell of varnish and new paint. Impressed, they look at the magnificent marble in the seemingly endless gallery. The date is 12 January 1939 - a New Year Reception for the diplomatic corps. The event coincides with the inauguration of the new Reich Chancellery. After what seems an eternity, the ambassadors and emissaries reach the reception hall. There, they are welcomed by Adolf Hitler - at the first and last New Year reception in this building.

The old Reich Chancellery looks like it was fit for a soap company, Hitler remarks bitingly. A new Reich Chancellery is needed, he decides. He orders Albert Speer, his General Building Inspector, to design and build a new Chancellery reflecting the Third Reich's aspiration to world power. Speer has an entire street at his disposal for his design. The new Reich Chancellery is to stretch 500 metres. So if you walk down all of Voßstrasse, you get a feeling of just how vast this building was.  

Working without a break 

A brochure published to mark the opening of the Reich Chancellery contains the lines, ""The Führer's Reich Chancellery is built overnight, there Professor Speer has created a masterpiece!"". Not surprisingly, the new Chancellery takes more than one night to construct, although it is built within a year - quite an achievement. The workers are on site in shifts, day and night, every weekend, and every public holiday. The costs spiral to three times the original budget.  

Hitler's new Reich Chancellery opens its doors for a New Year reception. The reception rooms are designed to impress - but there is still scaffolding in the offices on the upper floor. The Reich Chancellery is not functional, and hardly used in the years afterwards. But it is a symbol of Hitler's power. 

Hitler is especially impressed by the long marble gallery, twice as long as the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles - a place hated by the Nazis as the scene of signing the Treaty of Versailles that ends the First World War. ""On the long walk from the entrance to the reception hall, they'll get a taste of the power and grandeur of the German Reich!"", Hitler says to Speer.  

Nothing left to see 

In the Second World War, the Reich Chancellery is less damaged than many buildings in the vicinity. Its ruins become a tourist attraction. Before the Potsdam Conference, both British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and US President Harry S. Truman come by to view it. Then work starts on demolishing this monolith - and takes seven times as long as it did to build it.  

When the Berlin Wall goes up, the open site of the former Reich Chancellery becomes part of the border area, lost in no man's land. Shortly before the Wall falls, East Germany constructs some prefabricated concrete-slab apartment blocks on the eastern section of Voßstraße. The tower blocks are still there today. In search of the remains of the Reich Chancellery, tourist groups often visit the tube station at Mohrenstraße. The red marble there seems suspiciously similar to the materials used for the Reich Chancellery. But historians have shown there is actually no connection. There really is nothing left to see of the Third Reich's once monumental symbol of power.

"Breitscheidplatz, 10789 Berlin",52.50481,13.3352,History,1,FALSE,Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church,"On the list for demolition - but saved by a grassroots protest by locals
",,,"A symbol of reconciliation
Demolition, reconstruction or something new? In West Berlin, what to do with the Memorial Church's ruins was hotly debated. Ultimately, they became a symbol of peace.

Architect Ego Eiermann feels more than annoyed. On 25 March 1957, his design for rebuilding the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church wins the architectural competition. He plans to entirely demolish the old church, left in ruins by the war. But unexpectedly, the locals fight fiercely to save their ruined church, fondly nicknamed the ""hollow tooth"" - and they succeed. You are now standing in front of the ruins of the old bell tower.  

Eiermann has to integrate this ruin into his revised design. As a poignant reminder of the horrors of war, the ruins are to stand as a memorial. The old bell tower is framed by four new structures - a church and a foyer, the new bell tower and a chapel. The end result is a compromise unifying the modern architecture with the historical fragment from the war.  

Island of peace 

When you look around, you can see the new bell tower on the left in the shadow of the ruins. The single storey chapel is in front of the bell tower. On the other side of the ensemble of buildings, the Kurfürstendamm boulevard is as busy as ever. Behind you, there is the noise of the traffic on Budapester Straße. Now, if you go up the five steps and enter the new church on the right, the first thing you'll hear is - nothing at all. This is an island of peace in the heart of the bustling metropolis.  

Egon Eiermann designs the church with a double wall to keep the noise of the big city at bay. The double wall has another effect as well, one for which the church is famous - it glows in a deep blue light. This effect is due to the powerful lights (today, energy-saving LED light bulbs) set in the two-and-a-half-metre gap inside the double walls. The lights shine on the blue glass mosaic windows, creating the glow inside and outside. The 23,000 individual glass panes for the church are the work of French artist Gabriel Loire. Installed only a few years after the end of the war, they show just how formative the idea of reconciliation is for Berlin. 

A church for peace 

The inside of the church is also rich in symbols of reconciliation. For example, the bronze plaque commemorating those who died opposing the Nazi regime and, set next to it on the north wall of the church, the Stalingrad Madonna.

On Christmas Eve 1942, during the long and bitter Battle of Stalingrad, German army doctor Kurt Reuber sketched this moving Madonna image in charcoal on the back of a map of Russia. Today, copies of the sketch also hang in the Russian Orthodox Cathedral of Volgograd (formerly Stalingrad) as well as in Coventry Cathedral in England.  

As a member of the Community of the Cross of Nails, the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church has another link with Coventry as well. The Memorial Hall of the old ruined spire includes a Cross of Nails made from nails found in charred roof beams in the old Coventry Cathedral, almost entirely destroyed during a wave of German bombing raids on 14 November 1940. As a sign of peace and reconciliation, the Cross of Nails is gifted to the memorial site in 1987.  

The new Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church is consecrated on 17 December 1961. Shortly after East Germany gives a concrete form to the division of Germany in the shape of the Berlin Wall, the western part of the city creates this symbol of freedom and reconciliation.

",,,"Governing a liberated country
Today, when you stand at the entrance to the Berlin Kammergericht (Court of Appeals) in Elßholzstraße, there are no obvious clues about how the building was used immediately after the war. But when you approach from Heinrich-von-Kleist Park, you find yourself standing beneath four empty white flagpoles. They date back to 1945-48, when the Allied Control Council held its meetings here. 

In the summer of 1945 Berlin is in ruins and occupied by Allied troops. Every state authority has collapsed following the defeat and unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany. Yet people have no sense of liberation. All they feel is hunger and hopelessness.  

In June, the four victorious powers announce that they will assume and exercise supreme authority over Germany. The Berlin Declaration is signed by the four most powerful men in the country: General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Marshal Georgi Zhukov, Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery and General Jean de Lattre de Tassigny. Germany is divided into four zones and the commanders-in-chief of the USA, the Soviet Union, Great Britain and France have total discretion over how they administer their particular zone. But they are keen to make joint decisions on issues that affect the country as a whole.  

An administrative authority is set up  

On 10 August 1945, the four men meet in the Plenary Chamber of Berlin's Kammergericht, a monumental, neo-Baroque building that has survived the war almost intact. Outside, the American, Soviet, British and French flags fly from the four flagpoles that still stand here today. The items on the Allied Control Council's agenda include the key objectives of the Potsdam Agreement: demilitarisation, denazification, decentralisation and, above all, rebuilding defeated Germany along democratic lines. 

Their delegates and interpreters then meet to tackle all the legal and organisational details on the 10th, 20th and 30th of each month. There is general agreement on the need to annul Nazi laws, dissolve and liquidate Nazi organisations and destroy any literature and works of a National Socialist and militarist nature. 

But as time goes on there is a growing sense of mistrust, particularly on the part of the Soviet Union towards the Western allies. All too often, the Control Council ""decides"" to make no joint decision. On 20 March 1948, the Soviet representative walks out of the Allied Control Council. This paralyses the whole administrative apparatus, with all its directors, committees and working groups. The division between East and West that keeps Europe in suspense until 1990 has reached the Plenary Chamber of the Berlin Kammergericht.

During the Nazi era, Freisler handed out at total of 2,600 death sentences.

",,,"Trapped in isolation
Between 1945 and 1950 hunger, disease and death stalk the Sachsenhausen Special Camp, along with a malign way of torturing the inmates - forced inactivity.

""Nothing happens."" No work. Nothing to do. Just starving, suffering, dying - and killing time.  This is how Stalinism expert Frank Nemetz describes life in the ten special camps set up by the NKVD, the Soviet Interior Ministry, after May 1945. Their aim is different to that of the Nazi concentration camps: torture through isolation. The prisoners are given nothing to do and are not allowed any contact with their families.  

They are imprisoned without trial. Under the pretext of preventing harm from ""anti-Soviet opponents"", the Soviets arrest Nazi functionaries, SA and Gestapo members, political opponents and ""suspicious"" young people. People are denounced at random or sent to Sachsenhausen simply for being unpopular. Many innocent people end up in Special Camp No. 7. 

The terror is back 

Around 60,000 people were imprisoned here between 1945 and 1950; around 12,000 starved to death or succumbed to disease, mental and physical exhaustion or the terrible conditions. They can never escape the stench of cesspools, putrefaction and disease. Every day, bodies are buried outside the camp.  

Today, when you stand on the site of the former camp, you are a free person in a place where freedom was abolished for 14 long years. Special Camp No. 7 was set up on the site of Sachsenhausen concentration camp in August 1945. The Nazi terror that reigned over the site from 1936 to 1945 has now been transformed into a new kind of tyranny. In 1948 it is renamed Special Camp No. 1 and becomes one of the three biggest special camps in the Soviet occupation zone. At first the inmates are allowed to play board games, exercise, listen to the radio and read the newspaper.  

But time hangs over them like the sword of Damocles. Their days are dominated by uncertainty and isolation. How long will I have to stay here? Will I ever see my family again? Will I survive? Special Camp No. 1 is dissolved shortly after the founding of the GDR, but only some of the prisoners are released. 5,500 prisoners are moved to GDR prisons. Those who are released are threatened with punishment if they talk about their time in the camp. The GDR completely conceals or plays down the existence of the special camps.  

Anyone who is lucky enough to be released from one of the camps is a different person from when they went in. After his release from Special Camp No. 2, painter Otto von Kursell (&dagger; 1967) described his health and finances as being ""in ruins"". 
",,"Around 30 children were born in Special Camps No. 7/ No. 1. After the camp closed, Soviet military tribunals transferred the women to the women's prison in Hoheneck and separated the babies from their mothers.

6.30 in the evening, and the opening bars of the Rolling Stones' Let's Spend The Night Together ring out. Some teenagers are secretly huddled over their radios, others have their parents' permission to listen to S-F-Beat. For this one hour, it doesn't matter whether you're a teenager in the West or the East.

In 1967, the Stones song is more than just an invitation. It's a chance to step into a world that is far removed from the Cold War. Ulli Herzog and Wolfgang Kraesze, alias Freddie Dreamer, know this. They are two of the presenters on Sender Freies Berlin (SFB) - Radio Free Berlin.  

West Berlin provides the soundtrack of youth 

When the distinctive intro Hey, hey, hey, S-F-Beat comes on the radio, politics is forgotten and it's all about English and American pop music. The presenters have managed to get hold of most of the records themselves. Tom Jones, Jimi Hendrix and the Beatles drift into teenagers' bedrooms on both sides of the Wall.  

Of course, the East German authorities hate Western radio stations. The music of the class enemy tends to make people yearn for freedom. ""If you're going to San Francisco, be sure to wear some flowers in your hair..."", sings Scott McKenzie. But there's an insurmountable barrier between Pankow and San Francisco. The East Berlin radio station Berliner Rundfunk does its best to attract young listeners with its programme DT 64, but everyone wants to listen to Ulli Herzog and co. with their creative jingles and freewheeling shows. Their fun, laidback style breathes new life into the broadcasting centre, the Haus des Rundfunks. 

Hot beats in a Cold War 

A few years earlier, the building had itself been caught up in the tensions of the Cold War. The building was in the British sector, but it was occupied by the Soviets until 5 July 1956. It was more than a year before Sender Freies Berlin moved in. The station quickly gained a reputation as a liberal mouthpiece, providing a platform for both right and left. The SFB's mission was ""to give West Berliners their own identity and provide GDR citizens with information"". 

Until 1989, the S-F-Beat show proved that this can be achieved with humour - and great music.

",,,"The Second World War ends. The Cold War starts
A sweltering summer, a heat haze over the ruins of Berlin. Close by in Potsdam, the Cecilienhof Palace survives the bombing raids unscathed - but is occupied by the Soviets. Just four months before, it was home to the last Crown Prince of old Imperial Germany. Now, Stalin takes it to host a meeting of the ""Big Three"".

Stalin's guests are US President Harry S. Truman and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. They are all here for a ""Berlin Conference"" to decide the fate of Germany after the war. But the capital city is in ruins, and there is no suitable venue for them to meet. Berlin is as Truman so aptly remarked ""a ghost city"".

Potsdam as the stage for world politics 

You are now in the courtyard of the Cecilienhof Palace, completed in 1917 for the former imperial Hohenzollern rulers. Untouched by the Second World War, this is the perfect location for the delegations of the Victorious Allies. The streets of Potsdam are transformed into a high-security area, controlled by Allied soldiers and especially by Soviet troops. With Stalin's paranoia and persecution mania, the high levels of security are a must. 

When you enter the Conference Room today, you first notice is the massive round table. With a diameter over three metres, the table was especially made in Moscow for this meeting. The leaders of the negotiations sit in the three armchairs. The room is filled with thick clouds of cigar and pipe smoke - President Truman is the only passive smoker present. In this stuffy atmosphere, one thing soon becomes clear - after Nazi Germany's unconditional surrender, the Allies no longer have a shared enemy or common interests.  

None the less, they do agree on the 'Four big Ds' - Germany's denazification, demilitarisation, decentralisation and democratisation. The country is to be divided into four zones of occupation, each administered with relative political freedom by one of Allied Powers. In the middle of this fateful meeting, the results of the general election in the UK are announced. The Labour Party has won a sweeping victory. The new Prime Minister Clement Attlee replaces Churchill at the negotiating table in Potsdam. But Attlee - a man Churchill once slightingly refers to as ""a sheep in sheep's clothing"" - is no match for Stalin. He proves unable to stop Stalin's proposal of making the Oder-Neisse line Germany's eastern border to Poland, resulting in the expulsion of around 12 million Germans from central-eastern Europe.  

Enter the Cold War  

Meanwhile, the United States Army detonates a test atomic bomb in the desert in New Mexico. From Potsdam, Truman orders atomic bombs to be dropped on Japan. The bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki cost the lives of 250,000 people and mark the start of the nuclear arms race over the coming decades. In 1949, the Soviets explode their own nuclear bomb, re-establishing the ""balance of terror"". The former Allies became competitors and enemies - resulting in the division of Germany and Europe into East and West. If you stroll the few metres from the Cecilienhof Palace to the banks of the Jungfernsee lake, you are standing directly in front of one concrete outcome of the Potsdam Conference until 1990 - the former border between East and West Germany.

",,,"Bread rolls, coffee and charity
The cold wind picks up the autumn leaves and swirls them through the streets of Berlin. Streets that are full of homeless people. This fast-growing industrial city can't cope with the tens of thousands who are leaving their villages and flooding into the capital in search of work and a better life.

Destitution stalks the streets of Berlin. Homeless people can be seen begging on every street corner. The journalist and writer Constantin Liebich, a member of the Protestant Church of Reconciliation, decides he has to do something. He gives a talk to members of a local protestant youth group in which he exhorts his audience to display some ""active, Christian charity"".  By the end of the event, he has recruited five volunteers and collected a whole 9 marks in donations. It may not be much,but Liebich and his helpers use this money and their boundless enthusiasm to organise morning prayer services followed by breakfast. On 22 October 1882, 25 homeless people turn up at Oranienstraße 19 for the first service. Before long their numbers have swelled to 600.

After a temporary move to the Fürst Blücher clubhouse on Weddingplatz, Liebich and his newly-formed association called Dienst am Arbeitslosen (Help for the Unemployed) set up shop at Ackerstraße 52, just 100 metres away on the other side of the street.

Berlin's first social workers

Two bread rolls, a cup of coffee and a church service are now the Sunday ritual. Locals soon start referring to it as the Schrippenkirche - the bread roll church. But Liebich feels he needs to do more than just feed the poor, though this continues to this day. The homeless need housing, the unemployed need jobs. Liebich decides to fight for these things too.

In 1902, he opens a centre for young homeless people at the association's clubhouse. This is in addition to the Schrippenkirche, which is now regularly feeding 1,000 people every week. Now young people also have somewhere to go to get warm. Liebich's goal is to ""help people help themselves"". The association sets up its own employment agency and leads by example - it takes on many unemployed people in its office, helping them to return to earning a living.

Hunky dory

The association also launches another famous initiative: Die Brocke - the hunks.Every day, it collects junk and rubbish on the streets of Berlin then processes it in its own workshops. Today we would call this ""upcycling"". Back then, these ""hunks"" - the word relates to something that is broken off, like a hunk of bread - help unemployed tradesmen, along with poor workers who can visit the shop in Wedding to buy cut-price, recycled furniture and other household goods.

Since 1979 the Schrippenkirche e.V. association has been based in the building you see in front of you. It installed the five-tonne bread roll in the front garden to mark its 125th anniversary. It commemorates the ritual of feeding the poor that gave the association its name. Today, the building is a residential home for adults with disabilities. ""Help those who are weak to grow strong"" - Liebich's motto is still being lived to this day.
",,"The association has nothing to do under the Nazis, whose ideology dictates that no-one is officially unemployed or homeless. In 1939 the Schrippenkirche is forced to toe the official line, but it resumes its work in 1945 and begins rebuilding its headquarters, which were destroyed in the war.

",,,"The pain of a divided city’s separation
From summer 1962 until autumn 1989, the ""Palace of Tears"" is a needle's eye to freedom for anyone just visiting East Berlin or for GDR citizens allowed to leave temporarily - or even for ever.

The glass façade of the Tränenpalast - the ""Palace of Tears"" - rises directly in front of you. The vast row of windows of this former border control hall is deceptive. Built under East Germany's SED regime, this is not a light-flooded architecture of welcome. Instead, it is a silent witness of tragic scenes of farewell. During the division of Germany, this border crossing hall was nicknamed ""The Palace of Tears"" after the tears that flowed where you are now standing. Anyone bidding goodbye to relatives or friends here could never know when or if they would see them again. 

""Free architecture"" meets control mania  

In 1961, railway architect Horst Lüderitz is planning a very open, modern building in keeping with the contemporary architecture of his day. His steel construction is eight metres high with a trapezoid-shaped roof and long windows down to ground level. The building is intended as an easily monitored connection to Friedrichstraße Station. It soon becomes clear that Lüderitz does not have a free hand in his design. The East German SED regime likes the visual impression, but not the planned realisation. Made of glass - yes. But transparent? No, thank you very much! Ultimately, the windows do not actually reach the ground. Later, parts of them are also covered by building elements and signs.  

A needle's eye to freedom  

Outside, it is all about tearful farewells; inside the passport control units, under Stasi command, are waiting. Passport control always followed the same sequence. When you enter the ""Palace of Tears"", you have to present a valid passport. Then you are subject to a strict customs check, and then an intensive passport check. You hardly see anything of the light design of this glass-fronted hall. Instead, signs take you down a series of enclosed corridors snaking through the building's 500 sq. metres, leading you ever closer to the final check - the notorious control booth.  

Where fear rules  

The control booth is narrow and long. When you enter, the door automatically closes behind you. The exit door in front is also closed. Neither door has handles on the inside. The passport official sits behind a raised counter with a glass pane looking down at you, or up in the mirror giving a view of the entire floor of the booth. You hand over your passport. This is not a place for pleasantries. If you leave with just a few words, you consider yourself lucky. Conversation here often means lengthy and gruelling questioning. In some cases, people are even taken off for a body search. Some spend hours here before the buzzer finally sounds, the exit door opens, and they can continue to Friedrichstraße Station. Not everyone passes through this procedure unscathed. Attempts to escape from the GDR are foiled, and fates are sealed.  

Once, the Tränenpalast is intended as a symbol of the socialist system's superiority. Today, it is home to ""Border Experience. Everyday Life in a Divided Germany"", a fascinating permanent exhibition also showing some of the original equipment and furnishings in the ""Palace of Tears"".

",,,"A new gold standard for residential housing
In the 1920s, Berlin is a world city. But it is also a city where hundreds of thousands of people live in catastrophic conditions. The working-class tenement blocks with their many courtyards are not only dark and dirty, but also grossly overcrowded. Around 1920, one room is often home to five or more people. Hardly any of the rooms have bathrooms. Instead, there are communal toilets in the yards or in the stairwells.

By the early 1900s, urban planners and architects have long been calling for housing reform and better living conditions. However, only in the 1920s during the Weimar Republic does Berlin become a sounding board for experiments in urban housing.

In 1924, the city of Berlin commissions two housing cooperatives to develop the Großsiedlung Britz, a large residential estate in the south of Neukölln. The two cooperatives are the DEGEWO, an association for promoting residential housing, and the GEHAG, a non-profit building and savings shareholding company - and they represent two radically different approaches.

The two sides of an avenue

The project area is divided into two parts by a curved avenue as the access road. On the right and left of today's Fritz-Reuter-Allee, the two housing cooperatives are to construct three-storey terraced buildings with apartments as well two-storey detached houses. Yet although the remit was the same, the approaches on either side of the avenue could not have been more different.

To the east of the avenue, the DEGEWO constructs the Krugpfuhlsiedlung, an estate of traditional residential housing with saddleback roofs, bow fronts and pointed dormer windows. To the west, the GEHAG builds the Hufeisensiedlung estate, its alternative vision of architecture and urban development. When you walk down the avenue today, the contrast is only too apparent. Bruno Taut confronts the more traditional architecture with 32 almost identical housing units set in two long rows with tower-like projecting staircases reminiscent of military architecture. Since the facades are all in a blood-red plaster, the buildings soon became dubbed the Red Front, an allusion not only to the colour but also to the ideological beliefs of the Hufeisensiedlung estate's builders and residents.

Air, light and sun

The Hufeisensiedlung is named after the estate's horseshoe shape. In employing Bruno Taut, Martin Wagner, then head of the GEHAG and later Berlin's chief city planner, also employs a representative of the Neues Bauen architectural movement. Taut already has a reputation from the years before the First World War for his plans for the Falkenberg Garden City.

In his designs for the Hufeisensiedlung estate, he sets new benchmarks. The apartments, around 2000 in total, have a standardised floor plan, all with a living room, bedrooms, a kitchen and bathroom. That sounds quite normal today, yet is a luxury in the housing segment at that time for lower-paid workers.

The construction methods were traditional, although to provide more living space Taut uses flat rather than gabled roofs. The modern windows made the dwellings lighter and provided better ventilation. Every unit had its own garden or at least a view of green open spaces.

The GEHAG constructs the Hufeisensiedlung estate in six phases from 1925 to 1933. In 1932-33, the final seventh construction phase is completed under considerable financial constraints. This section is built without Taut's involvement, and is not part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Between aspirations and reality 

The Hufeisensiedlung is unable to fulfil its social role as a source of affordable healthy and humane housing. The estate's construction is simply too expensive, and the rents are out of the reach of people with low incomes. After the Nazi Party's seizure of power in 1933, many of the residents there are persecuted. One of them is the anarchist writer Erich Mühsam, murdered in the Oranienburg concentration camp in 1934. Bruno Taut and Martin Wagner also both leave Germany under the Nazi regime and go into exile.

"Heesestraße 15, 12169 Berlin",52.45694,13.32584,History,1,FALSE,Gymnasium Steglitz,"When the young people of Steglitz head off into nature, the young people of Germany are not far behind
",,,"A school hiking club becomes a national youth movement
Birds are chirping, bees are buzzing, and beetles are humming in the warm summer air. Voices can be heard in the distance. A group of young hikers are wandering through the forests and meadows, singing as they go: ""You birds of passage in the air / in the glow of the ether, in the scent of summer / in the waves of blue sky / You are my companions."" 

The Steglitz student stenographers' club and its leader, Hermann Hoffmann, are on a four-week trip through the Bohemian Forest. The teacher knows how to inspire his young students to enjoy the simple pleasures of the great outdoors - they sleep under the stars and cook their own meals. For the grammar school students from the middle-class district of Steglitz, freedom smells of pine trees, freshly cut hay and campfires.  

When Hoffmann leaves Berlin, a sixth-former, Karl Fischer, takes over as leader of the group. They want him to stay on as leader after he's finished his exams and left school, so they decide to change the club's legal framework. On 4 November 1901, the group meets in the basement of Steglitz town hall to set up a new committee for organising student hiking trips. The name of the new group, Wandervogel, or bird of passage, is taken from the words of a poem by Otto Roquettes that they like to recite when they're out hiking. Now the group can show their parents and the school that the club has an official, legal framework that will allow them to carry on as before.  

There's no escape from Prussian discipline 

The industrialisation of the German Empire is picking up speed and Berlin is rapidly expanding. The members of the Wandervogel movement are keen to escape the narrow confines of school and society by getting back to nature. Other clubs spring up under the umbrella of the life reform movement, which promotes progressive teaching, naturism and naturopathy and is an alternative to the prevailing modernism. Back to nature might sound romantic, but the Wandervogel group is organised along very strict lines. There is no doubt that Karl Fischer is the group's leader. He alone decides who can join the club and hike with the group as a novice, and only after they have sworn an oath of allegiance.  

When they're out hiking, the Wandervogel are easy to spot. They wear knee breeches, long woollen socks, waterproof capes and red neckerchiefs. They carry rucksacks, hiking poles and wear green club caps with gold and red stripes. Some of them carry guitars and other instruments, as they like to sing along the way.  

The original Wandervogel group in Steglitz splits up after just three years, mainly because of Fischer's authoritarian leadership style. But by then the Wandervogel have become a national youth movement. ""The movement had no fixed goals, they just wanted to ramble, explore, experience and be free"", writes H.

",,,"The battle of the revue show impresarios
In Berlin in 1924, fans of the popular large-scale revue shows are spoilt for choice. Three competing revue theatres are set close to one another, on opposite banks of the River Spree near Friedrichstraße station. The Admiralspalast theatre, under operetta director Hermann Haller, is showing the sparkling Noch und Noch. The Komische Oper theatre is home to James Klein's scintillating Das hat die Welt noch nicht gesehen. But both these are topped by Erik Charell's revue An alle in the largest and most spectacular theatre - the Großes Schauspielhaus.

A cavernous auditorium - complete with stalactites

Today, a large new apartment block occupies the site where the Großes Schauspielhaus once stood to the north of Bertolt-Brecht-Platz. In its first life, the Großes Schauspielhaus is a market hall, and then a circus arena. After the First World War, architect Hans Poelzig transforms the building into a sensational expressionist theatre seating 3000. The pillars and the massive domed auditorium are impressively decorated with thousands of stylised stalactites. The Großes Schauspielhaus is in a stable of theatres managed by impresario Max Reinhardt. In 1924, when dancer and choreographer Erik Charell is appointed stage manager, his shows start breaking box-office records.

Spectacular themed revues - a sensual mix of music and dance

Charell's large-scale revue shows include stunning stage sets and a good shot of music and dance. Entertaining short scenes and acts are loosely linked by an overarching theme. Large ensemble dance numbers alternate with solo stars from variety theatre or cabaret. The fast-moving revue shows present a rapid succession of comedians, acrobats, singers, and ""tableau vivants"" (""living pictures"") with elaborate costumes and stage settings to match. Audiences are equally fascinated and puzzled by troupes of female show dancers moving rhythmically in precision, often emulating routines developed by the Tiller Girls, the best-known dance troupe from London. These 1920s shows also incorporate popular American jazz music.

The harsh reality of competition

Diagonally opposite the Großes Schauspielhaus is the former Komische Oper, where James Klein stages his light-hearted revues. Klein is renowned for designing especially revealing costumes for his showgirls. Today, the Hotel Meli&aacute; stands on the site of the former Komische Oper. Only the Admiralspalast, directly next to the hotel, still exists today. In the 1920s, the Admiralspalast theatre is firmly in the hands of Hermann Haller. With many years of experience staging operettas, his revues are confidently stylish and tasteful. But Charell wins the battle of the revue show impresarios. The theatres under Haller and Klein run out of funds, bankrupt. In 1929, Charell revamps his programme to focus on operetta, ensuring his theatre remains successful - until 1933 and the Nazi seizure of power.

To escape the Nazi regime, Erik Charell and Hermann Haller flee into exile. James Klein is murdered in Auschwitz. The Großes Schauspielhaus is renamed the Theater des Volkes (Theatre of the People). In keeping with Nazi policies, the amphitheatre's expressionist design with stylised ""stalactites"" is removed, and a special VIP theatre box built for Hitler. After the Second World War, the theatre reopens as the Friedrichstadtpalast. In the 1980s, the old theatre building is closed and demolished. A new Friedrichstadt-Palast is built just around the corner in Friedrichstraße, opening in 1984. In front of the Friedrichstadt-Palast, there is a memorial to the theatre's founding figures Erik Charell, Max Reinhardt and Hans Poelzig.
",,"In the 1920s, nudity on stage is still a political issue. In 1925, complaints are made about the belly dancers in Charell's revue Für dich. All revue shows include very scantily clothed female dancers. In contrast, audiences only rarely saw nude men on stage.

",,,"The sound of freedom
It all began with Barclay James Harvest. It's 30 August 1980, and the band are playing to thousands of fans in West Berlin, in front of the Reichstag. Meanwhile, more than a hundred East German fans gather on the other side of the Wall to listen to songs like Hymn and Life is for Living. 40 of them end up under arrest.

The Stasi and the police are on high alert. The 20th birthday of the GDR had already led to clashes when Western stations mistakenly announced that the Rolling Stones would be playing on the roof of the Axel Springer building. Thousands of East German fans flocked to the Wall. Since then, the East German regime has been sensitive about music, because it's impossible to stop its sound carrying over the border.   

Concert for Berlin brings international stars to the city 

June 1987, and West Berlin is celebrating the city's 750th anniversary with a three-day open-air festival on the lawn in front of the Reichstag. Over the course of these three days, East German fans also gather to listen to artists such as David Bowie, the Eurythmics and Genesis. On the first evening, the sound of Heroes drifts over the Wall. The song about a couple in the shadow of the Wall reaches the people who are standing on the other side - precisely where you are now. 

The last stretch of Unter den Linden boulevard at the entrance to Pariser Platz is where the death zone begins. Security is incredibly tight, and Pariser Platz is closed off as far as Wilhelmstraße. But it's still possible to see the Reichstag. The fine square we see today was reduced to rubble during the Second World War. It was cleared after 1945 and left as wasteland. The buildings that block your view of the Reichstag were built after the Wall came down.  

From peaceful gathering to political protest 

On the second evening, the Eurythmics take to the stage. The wind has changed direction and the music rings out all along the Wall. Between Pariser Platz and Charité, people gather to listen to Annie Lennox's distinctive voice. The crowd are well-behaved, but the police are getting twitchy. They start checking papers - teenagers, students, workers, punks, rockers and pop fans alike. Then the loudspeakers blare out: ""Attention, attention! This is the Volkspolizei! Leave the area immediately and go home!""  

What? The state is trying to ban grown adults from listening to music? This harassment creates a sense of shared identity among the diverse crowd. They will not be moved. They will resist. When the police start using violence against peaceful citizens, swinging their batons at the crowd and making arrests, the music fans morph into political protesters. They start to whistle, calling for Gorbachev and chanting: ""The Wall must go!"" 

This evening, two years before the fall of the Wall, has a huge impact on everyone who is there. Some people apply to leave the country, while it gives others the courage to join the protests that ushered in the end of the GDR in late 1989. The Concert for Berlin may not have brought down the ""anti-fascist barrier"", but it certainly caused it to wobble.
","Opening hours: 
Pariser Platz is open day and night","After this debacle, East Germany's leaders change tack and invite Western artists to come to the GDR. Before the Wall comes down, stars like Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan, Peter Maffay and Mireille Mathieu play in East Germany. And the most famous of the music imports is of course Udo Lindenberg, who rocks the Palace of the Republic to its foundations.

",,,"Hand-to-hand combat
Storms over Berlin, traffic chaos in Potsdamer Straße - but Berliners are not going to be put off by overcrowded trams and a few muddy puddles. Because tonight there's heavyweight boxing at the Sportpalast.

In the Twenties, the multi-purpose arena in Schöneberg is a mecca for sports fans. Tens of thousands of spectators gather to cheer on cyclists as they whiz around the track during a six-day event or Norwegian figure skater Sonja Henie as she spins across the ice. Boxing is especially popular. It's the evening of the 4 April 1928. People in the stands have paid 5 marks to get in, while the wealthy punters at ringside have forked out 75 marks. It's not cheap entertainment, but the arena is sold out. This kind of hand-to-hand combat attracts people from every social class. Bravery, aggression, speed - such attributes have turned boxing into a mass spectator sport and the boxers themselves into superstars. 

The German Oak 

The main attraction is the third fight of the evening, the German Heavyweight Championship. The favourite among bookmakers and journalists is defending champion Franz Diener, known as the German Oak. The Thüringian heavyweight is 1.83 metres tall and weighs in at a solid 175 pounds, mostly muscle. He is only 26 but this butcher by trade is an experienced boxer who has learnt his trade in America. 

His challenger, Max Schmeling, weighs in 10 lbs lighter. The 22-year-old has become a firm favourite among Berlin's boxing fans since becoming light heavyweight champion of Europe by beating the Italian Michele Bonaglia with a first-round knockout in the same arena just three months earlier. But this title fight against Diener is his first bout in the sport's top weight category. 

Berlin's sporting crucible  

The referee's talk is brief, and the crowd goes quiet as the anticipation builds. Diener looks tense when the fight gets underway, but he's on the front foot. Schmeling suffers an injury to his thumb early on; he later discovers he has chipped the bone. Round three really gets the crowd going. Diener surges forward, forcing Schmeling onto the ropes. The challenger is briefly confused, unable to defend himself from the punches that are raining down on him. But the defending champion seems reluctant to go for the killer punch. Schmeling raises his guard and goes on the counterattack. The pain in his hand is forgotten. He breaks through Diener's guard, landing a hard right to his opponent's eye. Blood pours down Diener's face, clouding his vision. The German Oak is toppling but refuses to be felled. 

The boxers batter each other remorselessly for 15 rounds; punches hammer into faces and ribs. The final bell rings and the fight for fame, honour and 30,000 marks is over. Both men are so exhausted they can barely stand. The audience screams, claps, cheers. The Sportpalast has once again lived up to its reputation as the capital's sporting crucible. The judges declare Schmeling the winner on points. Controversy swirls around his wafer-thin success, but Schmeling doesn't care. He is the undisputed champion of Germany and a stellar boxing career lies ahead.
",,"But victory is quickly followed by disillusionment. Schmeling only remains German champion for four weeks. The injury to his thumb proves slow to heal and he can't defend his title, so the boxing association forces him to relinquish all his titles. But the young boxer has much loftier ambitions. In May 1928 he boards a ship bound for America. Big purses and world championship titles are beckoning.

"Bussardsteig 9, 14195 Berlin",52.46692,13.27472,History,1,FALSE,Brücke Museum,"The Brücke group shocks the art world in the early 20th century
",,,"Rejecting convention, revolutionising art
""People spat on our paintings and scribbled insults on the frames; and one painting of mine (...) had a hole punched in it by some delinquent using a nail or pencil"", recalls the painter Max Pechstein. The setting for these acts of vandalism is an exhibition in 1910. Some visitors are so angry about the modern style of the paintings that they try to deface them - the ""Brücke"" artists have arrived in Berlin.

When Fritz Bleyl, Erich Heckel, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff first met in Dresden eight years earlier, they had no inkling of the impact they would have on the evolution of 20th-century art. The four architecture students were just keen to find a new form of free artistic expression and break with artistic convention. Later, Heckel comments: ""We were clear about what we wanted to get away from - but less clear about where we were going"". 

Pioneers of Expressionism  

On 7 June 1905, these four self-taught artists form Die Brücke (The Bridge). The group have no interest in producing lifelike art but want to portray their subjective perceptions in their work. They not only reject the established conventions and aesthetics of classical art, but also its techniques. They change shapes, dispense with details and perspectives, reduce motifs to simple woodcut-like forms, use vibrant colours - and become pioneers of German Expressionism.  

After 1906, other artists, such as Max Pechstein, join the group and they recruit a number of passive members and sponsors. The Expressionist rebels move to Berlin from 1908 onwards, but they are cold-shouldered by the city's leading artistic movement, the Berlin Secession.  

The Chamber of Horrors  

In protest, the Brücke artists join a break-away group called the Neue Secession (New Secession). At their first exhibition in May 1910, some of the paintings are damaged by the ""delinquents"" that Pechstein later mentions. Their work comes under fire in the press, who refer to the room where the Brücke group are exhibiting as the ""Chamber of Horrors"". 

Despite this controversial debut, the Expressionists gain a degree of recognition in Berlin, but the group breaks up in 1913 due to personal and professional differences. The Nazis outlaw the Brücke style of art in the 1930s, branding it ""degenerate"". The artists are no longer allowed to exhibit, and their paintings are confiscated or destroyed. Ernst Ludwig Kirchner kills himself with a shot to the heart on 15 June 1938.   

The artistic movement only gains international recognition after the war. Karl Schmidt-Rottluff begins building a Brücke museum in the early Sixties. It opens seven years later in the Dahlem district of Berlin. Today, the bungalow-style building houses the largest displayed collection of the group's works, including 400 paintings and thousands of drawings, watercolours and sculptures.

"Nollendorfplatz 9, 10777 Berlin",52.49946,13.35337,History,1,FALSE,U1 – Nollendorfplatz,"Werner von Siemens has a vision, and Berlin finally has an elevated railway
",,,"Next stop: an elevated railway
If it were up to Werner von Siemens, you'd be standing in the middle of Friedrichstraße right now. But the city authorities were reluctant to have a train clattering down the narrow shopping street. So Germany's first elevated electric railway - and only the fifth in Europe - was built here instead. The viaduct over Kleiststraße and Bülowstraße was designed to connect the main line between Zoologischer Garten and Schlesiches Tor.

You are standing in front of Nollendorfplatz subway station and the rails of the U1 line are above your head. The elevated railway goes underground at this point. To the left, the line runs overground to the east, and the line on the right runs underground. The residents of Charlottenburg insisted on this as they didn't want their view of the new Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church to be ruined. But let's start at the beginning.  

22 years before the first U-Bahn line is opened, Werner von Siemens presents his plans for the construction of an elevated electric railway line. Berlin is growing fast and its streets are hopelessly congested. Siemens is looking for ways of making the city's traffic move more freely. Horse-drawn buses and trains, steam trains - the roads are clogged with vehicles loaded with everything that needs to be moved from A to B in Germany's largest industrial city.  

These problems could be easily resolved with an elevated railway system like the one in New York. Nowadays urban planners dream of providing citizens with easy access to public transport, and Siemens and his company Siemens & Halske had demonstrated that electric-powered transport was possible. The world's first electric tram was already running in Berlin-Lichtefelde. But Berlin's authorities decided he couldn't build his railway just yet. So Siemens took himself off to Budapest and built precisely the kind of electric transit system that his home town had rejected.  

Perseverance pays off   

After their initial plans are rejected, Siemens & Halske apply for the concession to build a railway line between Warschauer Brücke and Zoologischer Garten. In March 1896 - three-and-a-half years after the death of Werner von Siemens - approval is granted, and the ground-breaking ceremony is held in Gitschiner Straße on 10 September. Berlin's first combined elevated and underground railway line is inaugurated on 15 February 1902 with senior dignitaries making the first official trip along the line. The U1 still runs along this historic route. As you climb the steps to the station, stop and look at the plaque commemorating Werner von Siemens' life. The overground/underground railway line that is such an important part of city life is just one of his many contributions.

",,,"22,790 rays of peace
Pour the glass - and shatter it. Pour again - and shatter it again. French stained glass artist Gabriel Loire is assembling millions of glass fragments to create mosaic windows for the new Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. Every piece is different. He is quite literally piecing together a work of art.

Perhaps it's an allegory of war and the life that follows - something new can emerge from the ruins; beauty can arise out of shattered dreams. And nations at peace can achieve more than nations at war. Gabriel Loire, the French artist who is commissioned to design the windows shortly after the end of the Second World War, proves to be the perfect partner for architect Egon Eiermann. Eiermann gives the new Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church its form and face, while Loire fills in the individual features.  

A pioneer of slab glass painting 

The master craftsman from Chartres has something of a Sisyphean task. Loire sets to work framing the nave and bell tower with nearly 23,000 pieces of glass mosaic. He produces sheets of glass two centimetres thick in shades of ultramarine, cobalt, indigo, azure and royal blue, ruby red, emerald green and pale yellow. Then the workshop resounds to the sound of Loire shattering the glass. In the finished window, the splintered edges of the broken glass refract the light in fascinating ways. With these glass mosaics, Loire has 'painted' 22,790 square honeycombs, which are cast in concrete and used as a linking motif on the church, bell tower, foyer and chapel.  

Check out the outer wall of the church and you'll see the individual wall panels each have 5 x 5 honeycombs, so 25 in all. Inside, there are 56 honeycombs per wall panel, and in the two-and-a-half metre space between the exterior and interior walls the windows are illuminated by spotlights. Make sure you stand in the octagonal nave, where you can immerse yourself in the play of light, the gorgeous shapes, the overwhelming blueness. The light is always different, depending on its angle and the time of day.  

The new Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church was consecrated on a cold December day in 1961, one week before Christmas. Since then, it has beamed a message to the world. A message of peace and the freedom to create a work of art from blue fragments. A work of art like this stained glass window.

",,,"A pastor against the Nazis
The Kaulsdorf district in Berlin. Heinrich Grüber is pastor of the Jesus Church in the Kaulsdorf parish. In the evening, he is sitting in the rectory with his family and members of the congregation. Suddenly, there is a loud knocking at the door. When he opens the door, he sees frightened people, Christians of Jewish ancestry, standing out in the cold. They are fleeing from the SS and SA troops. In Berlin, the synagogues are on fire, and Jewish shops are being looted and plundered. The date - 9 November 1938.

From field artillery to rectory 

The memorial plaque on the stone wall of the old Kaulsdorf graveyard commemorates the life of Heinrich Grüber, pastor and opponent of the Nazi regime.

Born in 1891 in Stolberg, in today's North-Rhine Westphalia, Heinrich Grüber serves in the field artillery in the First World War and also as a military chaplain. Later, he briefly joins the Nazi Party, but soon leaves it again.  

In Kaulsdorf, he is the Lutheran pastor. The parish council is dominated by Hitler's church party, the German Christians, and they are strongly against his appointment. Grüber joins the Emergency Covenant of Pastors, founded in September 1933 and opposed to the adoption of the Nazi regime's Aryan policy in the church. Soon, he allies himself with the Confessing Church, an inner church movement against the plans for a single pro-Nazi Protestant Church. In his sermons, Grüber openly criticises the Nazi regime.  

Hidden in allotment gardens 

When the Nazi regime persecutes Christians with Jewish ancestry, the national Protestant church authorities remain silent. Under the citizenship law introduced by the Nazi regime in 1935, their lives change dramatically. Now, anyone not ""Aryan"" under the Nazi racial laws is persecuted by the authorities. The Protestant Reich Church is taken over by the strong pro-Nazi group. But Pastor Grüber offers the persecuted Christians a refuge - and dozens of them come to Kaulsdorf. Grüber sets up the Büro Grüber -a centre to help those now classified as ""non-Aryan Christians"". The centre is constantly under Gestapo surveillance. In 1938, in the days after the November Pogroms, Grüber organises hiding places for the persecuted Christians in nearby allotment gardens. 

His Büro Grüber gives them pastoral and practical care, and helps them escape from Germany. He applies for permission for them to emigrate through the usual official channels. One day, Grüber has to face the SS officer Adolf Eichmann, head of the department responsible for Jewish affairs and emigration. Eichmann is one of the main figures responsible for Jewish deportations to the death camps. The two men sit face to face - but are worlds apart. Eichmann is at a loss why anyone can support ""these people"".  Grüber replies by citing the parable of the Good Samaritan.  

In the two years that Büro Grüber is active, it helps nearly 2000 people to emigrate. In 1940, the Gestapo closes the centre. Pastor Grüber is arrested, held in concentration camps, first in Sachsenhausen and then Dachau. After two years, his family is allowed to visit. They find him dressed in prison clothing, his teeth knocked out and his head shaven. In 1943, Grüber is released. Broken in body but not in spirit, he returns to Kaulsdorf. 

After the war, he continues the work he started with his Büro Grüber, now helping Holocaust survivors. In the post-war years in Berlin, before the Wall, he lives in the West but regularly goes to East Berlin where he is provost of the St. Mary and St. Nicholas parish. He often acts as a mediator between East and West. When the Wall goes up in 1961, he can no longer travel between the two parts of the city. Heinrich Grüber dies in Berlin in 1975. The help centre he establishes as Büro Grüber still lives on today as the Protestant Aid Agency for the Racially Persecuted, a foundation dedicated to helping the Christians persecuted in the Third Reich and their descendants.

"Erich-Weinert-Straße, 10409 Berlin",52.546389,13.432778,History,1,FALSE,Wohnstadt Carl Legien residential estate,"In his plans for the Wohnstadt Carl Legien estate, Bruno Taut again demonstrates his impressive architectural skills, creating a modern urban estate close to the city centre.
",,,"Bruno Taut’s last major project
Here, Bruno Taut shows what modern urban planning can do - creating a feeling of green space despite the housing density.

As the 1920s draw to a close, Bruno Taut is widely acknowledged in Berlin for his pioneering work. He is also chief architect for the GEHAG, a non-profit building and savings shareholding company. Berlin is constantly growing and urgently needs new housing - a perfect situation for a forward-looking, innovative architect.

The Wohnstadt Carl Legien residential estate is Taut's last major project for social housing in Berlin. For this project, he plans exactly 1149 apartments on a relatively small site around today's Erich-Weinert-Straße. The apartments, mainly smaller units from 1.5 to 3 rooms, attract singles or couples with at most one child.

No less than four of the six Berlin Modernism estates inscribed as UNESCO World Heritage are designed by Bruno Taut - a remarkable achievement. From the mid-1920s, he experiments with novel designs for residential living outside the heavily built-up inner city.

Rethinking on a tight budget

But over these years the conditions also change. Now, less building land is available - and less funding. The rent tax, introduced by city planner Martin Wagner in 1924, can no longer be earmarked just for housing projects. In 1929, in the wake of the global economic crisis, Germany's Chancellor Heinrich Brüning pursues a strict austerity policy.

New housing projects have to adapt to the new situation. The land for the planned estate is on the margin of the inner-city area. This is expensive building land and space is limited. Taut looks for a means of connecting densely packed apartments with a feeling of openness. His solution is a space-saving block construction in a U-shape, avoiding closed courtyards.

In this way, his multi-storied buildings can provide an optimal number of apartments, yet still leave room for spreading green areas. Moreover, with full-width loggias - a kind of covered balcony - facing the interior spaces, every resident enjoys a view of a lawn. As in the Schillerpark estate, here too Taut takes his inspiration from the work of the Dutch architect J.J.P. Oud. Previously, a balcony in Berlin was a privilege reserved almost exclusively for well-to-do tenants in street-facing apartments.

Making life colourful

Bruno Taut is no stranger to colour in his designs. Here, he applies colour again, this time to give the spatial elements a clear structure. Colour became Taut's trade mark - not just a simple means of design, but also very affordable. Along Erich-Weinert-Straße, the doors of the five-storey buildings are brightly painted in white and red or yellow, and the window frames are painted as well.

When the buildings were repaired after the Second World War, the original colour scheme was lost. Their uniform appearance also suffered, since some tenants turned the loggias into conservatories. From the early 1990s, it has been possible to restore the original look of the estate - so now it is again just as Bruno Taut planned it.

After a visit to the Herrnfeld Brothers' theatre, writer Kurt Tucholsky notes that he has ""laughed himself silly and then laughed himself sane again"" . The popular Jewish Jargon theatre goes from one success to the next, remaining true to its star actors - the brothers Anton and Donat Herrnfeld - and its location at Moritzplatz.

 

Even in the 1890s, the stage then close to Alexanderplatz run by brothers Anton and Donat Herrnfeld is renowned as a Jargon theatre offering a mix of Yiddish, German and local dialects in mostly humorous entertainment for the Berlin middle classes. In 1906, the Herrnfeld brothers build a new theatre at Kommandantenstraße 57 near Moritzplatz. Born in Hungary, the Herrnfelds had converted from Judaism to Protestantism. In their theatre, they present farces usually in Yiddish-German dialects often set in a Jewish family and satirizing supposedly typical customs, rituals and themes. Together, they write more than 100 farces in which they often also act. As a kind of popular folk theatre, the shows attract a broad audience, both Jews and Gentiles. But these come more from the theatre-going middle-classes than the working-class residents in Kreuzberg or the areas directly around the theatre. Their farces also raise the question of how far Jargon theatre is anti-Semitic or at least draws on anti-Semitic stereotypes - a subject of heated critical debate.

In 1916, after the death of his younger brother Donat, Anton Herrnfeld hands over the management of the theatre. In 1918, he sells the building to the Metropol Theatre, which renames it Theater in der Kommandantenstraße. The theatre directors, though, change almost every six months. In 1932, with the global economic crisis, high rates of unemployment and falling audience numbers, the theatre has to close.

In 1935, Hitler's Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels turns the empty building into the theatre of the Jüdischer Kulturbund (Jewish Cultural Association). The actors there also include Donat's daughter, Monica Herrnfeld, before she flees the Nazis to Shanghai. After the Kulturbund was forcibly dissolved in 1941, the theatre remains empty. In 1944, the building is almost totally destroyed in an air raid.

The ruins were demolished in 1953. Today, the Kommandantenstraße towards Moritzplatz has been totally rebuilt.

",,,"Hohenzollern grandeur in central Berlin
The imperial couple have arrived in Charlottenburg. In this up-and-coming residential district, all the main roads converge at the Zoological Gardens. And this is where Kaiser Wilhelm II has decided to lay the foundation stone for a church. In memory of his grandfather, it will be called the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church.

It's a bright, crisp spring day. The site for the new church has been acquired by the Evangelical Church Building Association and been brightly decorated for the special occasion. The same goes for the surrounding streets - after all, it's not every day that Wilhelm II and his wife Auguste Viktoria pay a visit. An obelisk  stands on Hardenbergstraße, between the Zoologischer Garten station and the building site, and Wilhelm I is also honoured with the presentation of a bronze bust. 

The guests of honour begin to arrive in the freshly spruced-up neighbourhood. They include churchmen, politicians, courtiers and of course, in Wilhelm's Prussia, the top military brass. A tent has been erected and is proudly flying the purple imperial standard. After all, the emperor and his wife can't be expected to stand outside. From here, a few steps lead down to where the foundation stone is to be laid, directly beneath what will be the main tower. You are standing on the exact spot.   

Birthday celebrations 

The coach bearing the Kaiser and his consort pulls up to loud cheers from the crowd. The music of the military band fills the square, the priest clears his throat to give his welcoming speech, and Wilhelm and Auguste solemnly sign the foundation deed. It is soldered into a small copper case, which will be inserted into the cornerstone. The cannons thunder their salute, while the Emperor applies the mortar and lays the foundation stone with three blows of the hammer. It was his idea to hold the ceremony on his grandfather's birthday - Wilhelm I would have turned 94 today.  

Wilhelm II is the driving force behind the construction of the Memorial Church. He has long been fighting for the ""return of unbelievers (...) to the Church and (...) love for the monarchy"".  He believes strengthening the Emperor and the Church is the way to counter the impending threat of socialism and anarchy. Auguste Viktoria is the patron of the Evangelical Church Aid Association and her Lord Chamberlain is overseeing the building project.  

Over the next few years, architect Franz Schwechten will erect a free-standing, monumental church building in a style that perfectly suits the Kaiser's taste. Wilhelm believes the Romanesque-inspired architecture is an expression of a ""pure Germanic"" style. For a Protestant church, it has an unusually rich interior. From where you are standing in the Memorial Hall, you can still make out its former magnificence. The statues, reliefs and mosaics on the vaults depict religious scenes but also pay tribute to the Hohenzollern dynasty. No-one should forget they are emperors by the grace of God.  

The Kaiser keeps his hand firmly in his pocket 

The new landmark in the west of the city is consecrated four-and-a-half years later. The design of the church is certainly not restrained, but Wilhelm II displays a certain restraint when it comes to putting his hand in his pocket. The building costs - today's equivalent of 45 million euros - are covered by rich donors from every corner of his realm.

",,,"From shtetl to big smoke
Close your eyes, go back in time and imagine the hustle and bustle of Grenadierstraße. You hear the shouts of the street vendors hawking their wares as they push their barrows down the street. And what's that pungent smell? Could it be the vinegar factory at no. 22?

A gang of kids rushes past after pinching an apple from the fruit crates on the street. Deep in conversation, small groups of Orthodox Jews in kaftans make their way to prayers. Tuneless singing drifts out of the open doors and windows. Make way - get off the road! A police car is trying to get through. You leap onto the pavement. Why is it so narrow? What's going on? It's 1928 and you're in Berlin's Scheunenviertel, the ""barn district"". 

""Jews from the East never go to Berlin of their own accord."" 

The 30 barns that gave the district its name have disappeared by the late 19th century when the first Jews arrive from Eastern Europe. Berlin is the halfway point between the major ports of Amsterdam and Hamburg and the ships that are meant to carry them to New York. But many end up staying in Berlin. They are all trying to escape - from the misery of the ""shtetls"", the Jewish settlements in Poland, Galicia and Romania; from the hostility and pogroms of the Tsarist empire and later the violence of the Bolsheviks. 

These Jews have many different reasons for coming to Berlin, but a single reason for staying here. They can't move on without money. In the Scheunenviertel they establish kosher shops and restaurants, set up prayer schools, open theatres and start to dream of living their lives in freedom. They turn the Scheunenviertel into a unique cultural area - a small town, a shtetl, in the big city. 

Poverty stalks the streets 

Jews from the East make up about a third of the population of this district. Conditions are tough, with people packed together like sardines. Many apartments are home to several families, with people living in cellars and attics. Many of the buildings predate the construction of the sewage system, so their residents have to go into the backyard to answer the call of nature. Let's hope it hasn't frozen up again. The nights are pitch black. Electric lights are few and far between and the gas lamps only provide a dim glow. 

The streets are full of deadbeats and scroungers. Mishket, the daughter of Rabbi Liebermann, describes them as follows: ""They were everywhere. They all had a particular family who they took money off each month.""  Then there are the people with no money but lots of ""ideas"". And, of course, the prostitutes, keys in hand, promising their potential clients a quiet spot in which to do their business.  

On the corner of Hirtenstraße stands Silberberg butcher's shop. During the Scheunenviertel pogrom of November 1923, this brave butcher did what he could to protect his fellow Jewish citizens. But ten years later, no one can save the Jews from the East. The Nazis wipe out Jewish life in Berlin. 

Today, when you walk down Almstadtstraße, there are few reminders of this bustling Grenadierstraße. But most traces of its misery and poverty have also disappeared.

",,,"Civic pride in Prussia's richest city
The Emperor is on his way to Charlottenburg. His carriage crosses the Landwehr Canal and enters the free city at today's Ernst-Reuter-Platz, before turning north west onto Berliner Straße. This is the spot where the imperial carriage drove past Charlottenburg's new town hall. But Wilhelm II is annoyed that the tower of this new building is several metres higher than the dome of his Charlottenburg Palace. In future, he takes a one-kilometre detour via Bismarckstraße.

We don't know whether his ""out of sight, out of mind"" approach worked. But the people of Charlottenburg don't care. This new town hall with its 88-metre-high tower was their birthday present to themselves. They built it to mark the 200th anniversary of this Brandenburg city in the affluent suburbs of Berlin, which was growing and thriving in the shadow of the imperial capital.  

The building on what is now Otto-Suhr-Allee allowed the good burghers of Charlottenburg to display their pride in their free city. Its symmetrical façade is watched over by Pallas Athene, the Greek goddess of wisdom and warfare and protectress of cities. Stand in front of the main entrance to the tower and look up. You will see her directly above the Charlottenburg coat of arms.  

Step inside and you'll see the interior is as magnificent as the exterior. Two sweeping staircases lead to the third floor, lavishly adorned with columns, reliefs, ornamentation and sculptures. Charlottenburg is Prussia's richest city in terms of tax revenue, and the town hall still reflects this wealth.  

City of Charlottenburg 

The new town hall is needed because the city is growing rapidly. Once the residence of Prussian kings, then a summer retreat for stressed Berliners, Charlottenburg soon becomes a magnet for industrialists and Berlin's affluent middle classes. Companies such as Schering and Siemens & Halske also move in, attracting workers to the city. By 1900, this small town has 100,000 inhabitants, and this figure triples in just ten years to 300,000.  

The old town hall is too small to serve a city of this size, so it is demolished and replaced by a new town hall designed by Heinrich Reinhardt and Georg Süßenguth. The magnificent new building costs 4.15 million marks - around 26 million euros in today's money. It provides the space needed for the city's administration, but also symbolises the town's growing self-confidence. This confidence is clear for all to see when the building is inaugurated on 20 May 1905, kicking off the city's 200th anniversary celebrations. It is also on display when the citizens of the free city vehemently oppose the incorporation of Charlottenburg into Greater Berlin, even after the First World War.

",,,"Liberate women from the kitchen!
Amelia Jenny Emilie Klothilde Johanna Braun, known as Lily, has a vision. She wants women to be able to combine a family with working life. Back in 1901 this was a revolutionary idea. Her solution is to build cooperative housing with a communal kitchen.

As the daughter of the distinguished General von Kretschmann, Lily Braun grows up in Prussia's wealthy upper class, where women are judged predominantly on their appearance. But she soon begins questioning the position of women in aristocratic society. 

Work/life balance under the Kaiser   

As a pioneer of German feminism and a committed social democrat, she has a clear goal: equal rights for men and women. She wants all women to be free to make their own decisions - both as mothers and in the workplace. But she believes they are held back by the burden of domestic chores, so she revives an old socialist idea - cooperative living. 

Housing is in short supply after the First World War, so Lily proposes building apartment blocks with communal kitchens. They would be equipped with all mod cons, reduce construction costs and be managed by employees. For Lily, the advantages are obvious: communal household management would liberate women from domestic chores, promote emancipation, reform family life and even improve eating habits. 

Mod cons and the masses don't mix  

Despite her enthusiasm, she is unable to win the support of the socialist women's movement. Her critics say the costs involved make her idea unsuitable for the working class. But Lily is undeterred. In 1903 she commissions architect Kurt Berndt to design a building with a communal kitchen on Olivaer Platz. Apart from the large kitchen, the building will have ""bright, airy, simple apartments of all sizes with bathrooms, gas cooking facilities, central heating, gas and electric lighting and passenger lifts in the equally well-equipped front and rear-facing parts of the building.""

It will also come with mod cons such as a centrally controlled vacuum cleaner system. But by 1904 the project is already struggling due to lack of funds, and it is abandoned later that year. 

However, in 1908 and 1909 several buildings with communal kitchens are constructed by the Einküchenhaus-Gesellschaft der Berliner Vororte, an association set up for this purpose. The first of these is built at Kuno-Fischer-Straße 13. But the idea still fails to catch on, and the communal kitchens are replaced with small private kitchens within a few years.   

But the idea of communal housing has never died out, Since then, Berlin has been home to a range of cooperative living initiatives, such as the Corbusier House, and the M29 and Mehringhof housing projects.
",,"The new housing model involves equipping the kitchens with all mod cons. These include electricity, central heating, a hot water supply, garbage chutes, centrally controlled vacuum cleaners, dumb waiters and a laundry room with a rotary washing machine. Invented in 1902, the latter was a breakthrough in labour-saving appliances.

",,,"A six-pack of star architects
Model for modern urban planning and UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Großsiedlung Siemensstadt residential estate offers a fascinating insight into modernism's diverse architectural styles.

In the late 1920s, Berlin's chief city planner Martin Wagner commissions six architects to plan a new residential estate in the north-west of Berlin. The estate is to provide affordable housing for the workforce at the nearby Siemens production site. Between 1929 and 1934, a total of 1379 apartments are built, all with either 2 or 2.5 rooms.

The estate's six architects include four members of the Der Ring avant-garde association: Walter Gropius, Hans Scharoun, Otto Bartning and Hugo Häring. The other two architects involved are Fred Forb&aacute;t and Paul Rudolf Henning.

Breaking with tradition

The aim is to find architectural and urban planning innovations for a modern world. The time has come to move on from perimeter block developments with their dark courtyards - the traditional approach in pre-1918 Germany. This estate sets out to create similar conditions for everyone living there - the same space and light, and an equal chance to enjoy sun and fresh air. The six architects soon agree on dividing the design of individual rows of houses between them.

Hans Scharoun, responsible for the estate's overall urban planning, proposes an entirely new style of residential estate for Berlin. With this design, he can realise his idea of a residential neighbourhood - rows of housing set in generous space and communal green areas.

Six individual signature styles

Strolling through the estate today, take the time to look at the individual architectural details. With each architect responsible for individual rows of houses, the details form a kind of personal signature.

Hans Scharoun designs the access to the estate, creating a sort of funnel of three five-storied buildings on both sides of the street. He also borrows some elements from naval architecture, such as the circular windows recalling portholes.

Very different principles are applied to the two rows on the western side of the spreading estate. Here, Walter Gropius, founder of the Bauhaus, has kept to a cool functional elegance. The white block façades broken by the dark grey of the windows and the angular contours of the balconies are informed by the rationality of the New Objectivity movement.

Otto Bartning's long ribbon building stretching 338 metres is oriented east-west. The living rooms and bedrooms face south, the kitchens and bathrooms are set to the north. The plain façade is certainly not to everyone's taste, and locals soon nickname the building the lange Jammer ('long lament'). 

In Hugo Häring's designs for his rows of houses, natural materials and colours play a large part, with warm brown and ochre tones harmonising with the landscaped grounds. Here, the most noticeable elements are the kidney-shaped balconies projecting from the façades.

The rows of houses by Fred Forb&aacute;t and Paul Rudolf Henning also bear each architect's own signature. On some ground floor apartments, Henning integrated terraces, underscoring the focus on fresh air and sunshine. Forb&aacute;t's architecture is inspired by clear lines and geometric shapes, enlivened with brick elements on the staircases.

Each in their own way, the six architects of the large Siemensstadt estate aspired to nothing less than optimal, modern living conditions for the contemporary age. In realising that goal, they anticipated the trends in urban design in the post-war years.

",,,"Postcards against Hitler
Late summer 1940. A man leaves the door of the apartment building at Amsterdamer Straße 10. His hat is set low to cover his face. He walks rapidly towards the Müllerstraße boulevard. Unobtrusively, he enters Müllerstraße 174. He puts a hand-written postcard in the lobby, and quickly leaves. Together with wife Elise, Otto Hampel writes postcards against the Nazi regime.

The path to resistance 

After the National Socialists' seizure of power, Otto and Elise Hampel are just like almost all other working-class couples. They simply adapt to the new conditions. But in 1940, Elise's brother is killed in the war. His death prompts the couple to turn their back on the regime - and to act. From 1940 to 1942, driven by this personal tragedy, they write around 200 postcards and leaflets. These are a general call to stop supporting the Nazi regime's criminal war, and to overthrow the dictator Adolf Hitler: ""Down with Hitler's gang responsible for the war!"" 

Postcards for freedom 

Otto and Elise Hampel only attended elementary school for a few years. Their texts may reflect their simple background, but their feisty messages do not mince words: ""Hitlerism destroys the basis of all human rights!"" 

The Hampels are taking an enormous risk. The Nazi regime has draconian punishments even for just listening to foreign radio broadcasts. Most people finding the Hampels' postcards hand them directly to the police, either from fear - or obedience. The investigations are launched straight away. 

In the Gestapo's Department IV, Detective Sergeant Willy Püschel sticks flags into a Berlin map on the wall, marking where the postcards and leaflets are found. Most of the flags are in the Wedding district, though some are in Charlottenburg, Schöneberg and Kreuzberg. Despite the many clues, the Hampels repeatedly slip through the Gestapo's fingers. 

Finally, in October 1942, after two years of investigations, the police arrest them. A woman saw the couple laying out postcards on Nollendorfplatz square and reports them.  

Just a few months later, the People's Court sentences Elise and Otto Hampel to death for ""subversion of the war effort"" und ""preparing for high treason"". Faced with the death sentence, they start blaming each other. On 8 April 1943, Elise and Otto Hampel are executed separately in the Berlin-Plötzensee prison.

",,,"A city beneath the city
As far as Arthur Hobrecht is concerned, the whole thing stinks. Berlin's mayor has a problem. The city is mushrooming, and its sanitation system is at breaking point. The gutters in the streets and even the River Spree itself are becoming cesspools. Berlin smells like a toilet used by a million people.

It's not just the disgusting smell. The city is totally unhygienic and urgent action is needed. The eminent physician Rudolf Virchow raises the alarm and warns of cholera and typhoid epidemics if the city's streets and water supplies continue to be contaminated by excrement. The old wells have been replaced with a drinking water supply, but sewage is a growing problem. The city's sewage system has never been upgraded. Berlin's 16,000 water closets are flushed into the metre-wide gutters that line the streets. The majority of residents still have outhouses in their backyards, from where the waste is collected and often illegally dumped into the Spree under cover of darkness. Rats rummage through the waste looking for food, and a permanent foul stench hangs in the air. The rain regularly rinses out the gutters, but in winter the wastewater freezes, turning the streets to sheet ice.  

No more sewage in the streets  

The liberal mayor's brother, James Hobrecht, made a name for himself in 1862 when he came up with his Land Use Plan for the Environs of Berlin - known as the Hobrecht Plan. Earlier plans had been rejected, such as pouring all the city's sewage into the Spree. Holbrecht is charged with planning and building a new sewage and drainage system. 

Earlier in his career, Hobrecht had travelled to many major cities to study their sewer systems. Armed with this knowledge, the new urban planning office draws up a plan for Berlin, which it presents to the city council on 16 November 1872. It recommends the construction of twelve separate pumping stations, known as radial systems. The name comes from the sewer pipes that run down to the centre of the circular systems, like the spokes of a wheel. Pumping stations like the Radialsystem V pumping station that you see in front of you dispersed the sewage to drainage fields outside the city.  

Two-way traffic 

More and more people are leaving the countryside and heading for the city - meaning more and more sewage has to be pumped the other way. Sewage from Pumping Station V ends up in the sewage farms of northern Falkenberg. It passes through a pressure pipe into a settling tank where the solid sediment is skimmed off. Then it is spread over the drainage fields, where it is filtered through several layers of soil. Once it has been purified in this way, the water returns to the groundwater. James Hobrecht's radial system cleans up Berlin, improves the health of its inhabitants and makes lasting changes to the urban landscape. The sewer system is an ingenious city beneath the city.

",,,"The murder of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht
A cab pulls up next to a dark footpath in Berlin's Tiergarten. Eight men get out, seven of them in uniform. The eighth is dressed in civilian clothes and staggers as he gets out. The soldiers lead him down the path to the lake Neuer See. Shots ring out into the night of 15 January 1919.

It's three days since Freikorp troops suppressed the Spartacist uprising in Berlin, when Communists occupied the police headquarters and the office of social democratic newspaper Vorwärts. The bloody protests ended with leaders of the uprising going on the run, including Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht.   

Arrests and interrogations 

Around 9pm on 15 January, men of the Wilmersdorf militia force their way into Mannheimer Straße 43, the home of a merchant called Siegfried Marcusson. This is where the leaders of the Sparticist movement had taken refuge the previous day. Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg and Wilhelm Pieck are all led away. Luxemburg is allowed to take a small suitcase of books with her. They're taken to the Hotel Eden on Kurfürstendamm, today's Budapester Straße 35, which houses a division of the Freikorps. Liebknecht is brought in around 9.30, Luxemburg half an hour later. 

They're both taken to the interrogation room on the first floor. 38-year-old Captain Waldemar Pabst interrogates them separately. Luxemburg is clearly exhausted by the events of the last few days. She looks gaunt, with dark circles under her eyes. When Pabst ask whether she is really Rosa Luxemburg, she simply says: ""Decide for yourself"" and starts sewing up the hem of her skirt, which was torn during her arrest. And she reads Goethe's Faust - for the very last time. 

Transportation and murder 

During Luxemburg's interrogation, soldiers take Liebknecht down to the foyer around 10.45 pm. At the side exit, soldier Otto Runge strikes him twice in the face with his rifle butt. Bleeding, he is led to the car. Lieutenant Pflugk-Harttung's official orders are to take Liebknecht to Moabit prison. But instead he heads for the Tiergarten. Under the pretext of a flat tyre, the soldiers stop the car and tell Liebknecht to get out. Pflugk-Harttung pretends to release Liebknecht, but then shoots him in the back of the head at close range. Three other soldiers also fire at him.  

When Lieutenant Vogel takes Rosa Luxemburg outside shortly before midnight, she has no inkling of Liebknecht's fate. Runge once more swings his rifle butt, and she loses consciousness. She's still alive as she's driven away in an open-top car, but just 40 metres from the hotel, Lieutenant Hermann Souchon takes out his pistol and shoots her. The soldiers throw her lifeless body into the Landwehr Canal near the Lichtenstein Bridge. Today, a memorial to Rosa Luxemburg stands on this spot near the bridge.

",,,"Germany’s famous techno parade
""Hey, can you hear me?"" A storm of cheers. ""Really?!"" The crowd screams again. ""Hi, it's me, Dr Motte! Welcome to the Love Parade 1998 One World One Future! How are you doing?"" Cheers. ""We hope you'll have a good time. It's great to see you all. A million people are here!!"" The crowd on Berlin's Große Stern go crazy. 

A mini parade becomes a major event 

Dr Motte's Love Parade speeches at the Victory Column are the stuff of legend. The techno DJ started the open-air event in 1989 under the motto peace, joy and pancakes. In an interview he comments: ""The first Love Parade gave me goose bumps for five hours. We walked up the Ku'damm with 150 people, the police in front and behind. On the way back, we blocked an intersection and danced in the street."" 

Within 10 years, this small parade has turned into a major event. Every year, the Kurfürstendamm disappears beneath a sea of bodies dancing to the techno beat. Where you are walking today is where ravers came to party at the Love Parade - until 1995. Then, the Ku'damm was so full that the crowd spilled across the street and over to the Brandenburg Gate.  

Commerce, criticism and catastrophe  

""If the number of visitors continues to grow like this, the whole planet will be dancing by 2005"", says Love Parade organiser Ralf Regitz. But its founder, Dr Motte, is feeling disillusioned with the peace parade because it's becoming too mainstream, too commercial. And it has a bad image because of blatant drug dealing, the rubbish left in the Tiergarten, and the harassment of local residents.  

More than a million ravers descend on Berlin for the tenth anniversary of the Love Parade, but numbers start to decline in the 2000s. Sponsors jump ship and the event is cancelled in 2004 and 2005. It is brought back to life in 2006 - but without Dr Motte. ""I'm finished with the Love Parade"", he says. The Love Parade moves from Berlin to the cities of the Ruhr area, until disaster strikes in 2010. At the Love Parade in Duisburg, mass panic breaks out in a narrow tunnel. 21 people are killed and hundreds are badly injured. It spells the end of the legendary techno parade.

"Straße der Nationen 22, 16515 Oranienburg",52.76564,13.2646,History,1,FALSE,Sachsenhausen Memorial,"For the National Socialists, Sachsenhausen was a model concentration camp. It was an instrument of terror
",,,"Where martyrdom is part of everyday life
As soon as you enter this place, you start to question whether you really appreciate the freedom you enjoy every minute of every day. The Sachsenhausen concentration camp epitomises the National Socialists' systematic persecution and oppression. They imprisoned their opponents here under the most inhumane conditions.

Sachsenhausen concentration camp   

The order from the head of the SS, Heinrich Himmler, is to build a ""totally modern, up-to-date, easily expandable"" camp. The project is assigned to architect Bernhard Kuiper. He draws up a plan for the complex, which is laid out like an equilateral triangle. It incorporates the prisoners' huts, the commandant's office and barracks for the SS guards. The design is predicated on a ""geometry of total terror"". From watchtower A, a single machine gun has a clear line of fire over all 68 of the prison barracks grouped in four rings around the semicircular roll call area.  

The camp is separated from the outside world by 3-metre-high walls and an electrified barbed wire fence. Nine watchtowers, mounted guards and vicious guard dogs stifle any hope of escape for the prisoners. The Nazis have chosen to build their chamber of horrors in the forest north of Berlin. From 1938 onwards, the camp also acts as the administrative centre for all other concentration camps in Germany.  

As they enter the camp through the main wrought-iron gate, prisoners are taunted by the inscription ""Arbeit macht frei"" (""Work sets you free""). The SS commandant lives in Tower A. The tower's architecture symbolises the power of the SS, built solely on violence and cruelty. Every day, the prisoners spend up to 16 hours doing hard physical labour, building roads, working in local factories or in the forest. Death is an everyday occurrence. Inmates die from exhaustion, typhoid or dysentery. Day after day, prisoners are interrogated, tortured, shot or beaten to death. 

Martyrdom is a part of everyday life 

Martyrdom is a part of the prisoners' everyday lives. Thousands are crammed into 68 huts. Sometimes as many as 500 inmates are squeezed into a single hut. The day is organised along military lines. The lights come on at 4.15am sharp and the prisoners assemble for roll call. Their lives are dominated by back-breaking work. Anyone who doesn't toe the line or breaks the most minor of camp rules faces brutal punishment, such as being whipped on their naked buttocks. The force of the blows breaks the backs of some prisoners, exposes their kidneys or crushes their testicles. 

At first, the Nazis mainly send their political opponents to Sachsenhausen. Hitler's would-be assassin Georg Elser is held here until he is moved on to Dachau. Other prominent inmates include the Protestant pastor of the Confessing Church, Martin Niemöller, actor Erwin Geschonneck, publisher Peter Suhrkamp, and SPD politician Rudolf Breitscheid. The National Socialists also do not tolerate homosexuals or ""the workshy"" in their ""people's community"". With the outbreak of World War II, they start bringing people to the camp from all over the occupied territories. After 1941 thousands of Soviet prisoners of war are executed by shooting.
",,"The story is made even more tragic by the fact that the end of Nazi rule fails to restore peace to this place. 12,000 people die here after the end of the war, including Berlin theatre director and UFA film star Heinrich George in 1946. His son Götz George later commemorated the fate of his father in a film (George, 2013). Götz George is well known in Germany for his leading role in the popular TV crime show Tatort. The name of his character, Schimanski, is a tribute to former Auschwitz prisoner Tadeusz Szymanski, whom the actor met while shooting the film Death is my Trade (1977) in Auschwitz.

",,,"Souvenirs of the new freedom
Shortly after the Wall falls on 9 November 1989, the ""Wallpeckers"" are busy at work. These souvenir hunters, tourists, vendors and GDR opponents take away parts of the Berlin Wall bit by bit. The façade of this once insurmountable ""protective wall"" starts to crumble.

The West Berlin police loudspeakers boom out loud and clear: ""Stop chipping away at the Wall!"" But it takes more than that to stop the Wallpeckers. As they knock pieces off the concrete Wall, they create a wall of sound never heard before in Berlin - hammering, clanging, banging, and cracking.  

Anyone who hears this ""historic noise"" live can never forget it - just like Michael Glaser, working for East Germany's only record label VEB Deutsche Schallplatten. In his view, the noise of these days is ""an incredibly great sound"". And while the entire world watches events in Berlin spellbound, Glaser and his colleague Horst Langheinrich captures them acoustically - by hanging microphones out of their office window. Later, their recordings are released as the CD Mauerspechte - The Wall-Peckers -  the 100% authentic sound of the Peaceful Revolution. 

The façade crumbles  

Even before these dramatic events, there are solo actions attacking the Wall by, for example, John Runnings, a committed freethinker and peace campaigner. In 1986, Runnings climbs the Wall at Potsdamer Platz and, using a sledgehammer, knocks off some of the smooth pipe on top - an action later leading him to be dubbed ""Father of all Wallpeckers"". In the night of 9 November 1989, the Berlin Wall at the Brandenburg Gate is again conquered - this time by euphoric crowds attacking it with hammers or even their bare hands.  

A few days later the first souvenir hunters arrive, all keen to scavenge a piece of this world-famous concrete wall. In no time at all, the small group of people carefully knocking pieces off the Wall swells to hundreds. It becomes a kind of popular sport. Suddenly, the market for fragments of the Wall booms, especially for pieces showing traces of the original graffiti. In many cases, though, the colour is actually sprayed on afterwards - without colour, the fragments just look like any lump of concrete. 

Where is the wall? 

Work officially starts on demolishing what the GDR called the ""anti-fascist protective wall"" in June 1990. The Wall dividing Berlin for over 28 years is quickly removed. In autumn 1990, the most frequent question tourists ask is: ""Where is the Wall?"" The answer today is easy - bits of it can be found scattered around the world.  

In 1989, Hagen Koch is responsible for organising the demolishing of the Wall. He knows that selected pieces end up abroad as memorials, prize trophies, advertising gifts, art objects or as gestures of thanks - among the most famous recipients, for example, Ronald Reagan, Bill Gates and the Vatican. You can also find small original parts of the Wall in the Berlin Tourist Info Centres at Brandenburg Gate, the Central Station, the Europa-Center and the Hotel Park Inn by Radisson Berlin Alexanderplatz.

And if you find yourself in front of a surviving part of the Wall, for instance at the East Side Gallery, just remember: Chipping pieces off it is strictly prohibited!
","For more information on this location, please go to https://www.visitberlin.de/en/brandenburg-gate","Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy claims he was one of the first Wallpeckers. A photo supposedly shows a young Sarkozy hammering at a piece of Wall covered in graffiti. Allegedly, he is on the old GDR side - yet graffiti spraying was strictly prohibited in East Germany and, in any case, no one could have come close enough to the eastern side of the Wall to spray it. So when Sarkozy posts the photo on Facebook, many doubt its authenticity.

",,,"A “provocation” becomes reality
When Ronald Reagan uttered his famous words: ""Mr Gorbachev, tear down this wall!"", many people felt he was being deliberately provocative in the midst of the Cold War. But a few years later these words lead to him being hailed as a political prophet.

It's 12 June 1987, a special day for Berlin. Schools have been closed, roads blocked, the underground trains have come to a standstill. The city is celebrating its 750th birthday - but few people guess that it will be a historic day for quite different reasons. After all, the guest of honour, US President Ronald Reagan, is only dropping in for five hours. He's not even spending the night.  

Along with visits to the Reichstag, Bellevue Palace and Tempelhof Airport, there is one other item on the itinerary for the world's most powerful man: Reagan is to give a speech at the Brandenburg Gate. Political observers are not expecting it be particularly significant. 

Protests against the Cold War hardliner   

But some Berliners are in no mood for celebrating. They think Reagan is a Cold War hardliner who sees the Soviet Union as ""the evil Empire"". Protests break out in Kreuzberg and demonstrators fight running battles with police.  

Meanwhile, American and German flags are waving in front of the Brandenburg Gate. The Senate and US Embassy have assembled a sympathetic crowd for the speech. ""For the last two-and-a-half hours there's been what can only be described as a carnival atmosphere"". This is how reporter Peter Schulz describes the scene for West-Berlin based Radio in the American Sector (RIAS).  

The danger of an assassination attempt from the East forces Reagan to stand behind bullet-proof glass panels. He talks about the Olympic Games and disarmament before addressing his soon-to-be famous words to the Soviet Union's General Secretary: ""Mr Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr Gorbachev, tear down this wall!"" 

A muted response  

The crowd cheers - but no-one imagines Reagan's words will end up in the history books. Reagan's speech is covered in the Western press, but the response is muted. The Soviet news agency TASS, on the other hand, accuses the US president of delivering a ""war-mongering speech"".  

That's what Reagan's staff had feared, and it's why they tried to talk the president out of including the phrase. Just a few hours before the president was due to speak, the State Department sent over a less provocative draft of the speech. But Reagan sensed the mood of the time and stood his ground. 

After 1989, the president's words became famous all over the world. But he was not a prophet when he gave his speech two years earlier. He was simply summing up the prevailing mood in Berlin. 

In 2017, SPIEGEL revealed that Reagan had qualified his suggestions in talks with Moscow's Foreign Minister Shevardnadze in 1988. He admitted that it was ""perhaps unrealistic to suggest tearing down the entire wall"".

John Kornblum, later US ambassador in Bonn, and Peter M. Robinson, Reagan's speechwriter at the time, both still claim credit for these historic words.

The movie Theater am Moritzplatz (TAM) employs seven musicians, six ushers and ticket sellers, a projectionist, one woman for the cloakroom and two selling candied fruit. With daily shows with two changes of programme every week and a music ensemble providing the accompaniment, TAM offers everything film fans need.

Along with such popular films as Das Blumenmädchen vom Moritzplatz (The Flower-Girl of Moritzplatz) by Johannes Eißner, movie theatre operator Siegbert Goldschmidt also shows the film Blondes Gift (Blonde Poison), commissioning a poster by ambitious graphic artist Josef Fenneker. But soon after the film premières in September 1919, Berlin's Police President classifies Blonde Poison as indecent and bans it. The film tells the story of Loni, a femme fatale played by Hedda Vernon. Loni first brings disaster on her husband and then, when both her lovers die, shows no remorse.

TAM is part of the Establissment Buggenhagen, a large restaurant and beer garden which, in turn, belongs to the successful Aschinger-Bierquelle stock corporation. Aschinger epitomises the major league of Berlin's standing-only beer halls, a perfect fit for the liberal clientele at Moritzplatz.

In 1911, in a large Establissment Buggenhagen ballroom at Oranienstraße 147 on Moritzplatz, the Union-Theater movie theatre opens its doors. In August 1919, entrepreneur Siegbert Goldschmidt takes over the theatre. Goldschmidt, who also runs the well-known premiere cinema Marmorhaus on Kurfürstendamm, extends the space to create the Theater am Moritzplatz, a cinema seating 783 guests.

As early as 1925, Siegbert Goldschmidt's recurring health issues force him to give up the management of his cinema, which for a time also housed the Alhambra Varieté theatre. In 1928, after the cinema stands empty for nearly three years, Fritz Kärger leases it and renames it the TAM - Theater am Moritzplatz.

According to Chamber of Commerce and Industry records, Kärger employs seven musicians, six ushers and ticket sellers, a projectionist, one woman for the cloakroom and two selling candied fruit.

In the global economic crisis and with the rise of the talkies, Kärger closes his cinema at Moritzplatz and opens one in Fürstenwalde, outside Berlin.

In the meantime, Siegbert Goldschmidt is reduced to penury. Living on welfare since 1930, he is even unable to raise the money to have his company officially deregistered. He dies in February 1938 aged 64 and is buried on the Jewish Cemetery in Berlin-Weißensee.

",,,"A prestige project in the diplomatic quarter
Tiergartenstraße, early December 1942. It's still a construction site, but the building looks finished. With its shimmering reddish-brown façade, it stands out from the grey buildings all around. From inside comes the sound of hammering and the voices of German and Italian construction workers. This prestigious building project at the heart of the Third Reich is nearly finished - the new Italian Embassy.

New diplomatic quarter  

It is to be the most impressive embassy in the city's new diplomatic quarter. Adolf Hitler and his architect Albert Speer have drawn up a plan to turn Berlin into the new capital of the Reich, to be called Germania. But entire districts, including many embassy buildings, stand in their way. So Speer decides to build a new diplomatic quarter in the western part of the Tiergarten district to accommodate twelve embassies and residences.  

The best locations and largest plots are reserved for Germany's closest allies: Italy and Japan. Hitler has a particularly close political alliance with the Italy's Duce, Benito Mussolini. The Italian embassy is due to be built at one end of Siegesallee. This ""Victory Avenue"" runs to the Victory Column, which has recently been moved to its new location in the Großer Stern square.  

Construction work on the embassy begins in 1938. The architect is a German, Friedrich Hetzelt. But the Italians are involved in drawing up the plans and hold frequent meetings with Hetzelt. The results are clear when you look at the façade. The front of the building is faced with travertine, a type of stone from Tivoli. Marble from the Strona Valley has been used for the stairs and terraces at the rear. The Italian Embassy resembles a Renaissance palazzo. 

The party is over  

1939. Work on the building grinds to a halt just before it is completed. Germany has declared war on the world. The construction workers have to go off to fight. Building materials become scarce. But Hitler wants to show his respect for the Duce and insists the embassy has to be finished. So construction resumes with the help of Italian builders from Volkswagen in Wolfsburg. In autumn 1942, Renaissance doorways and sections of French wooden wall panels are delivered to ensure the interior is as magnificent as the exterior. Electrically operated dumb waiters are standing by, ready for the glitzy opening ceremony.  

But the party is cancelled. There's a war on, so it's not a good time to be swilling champagne and scoffing canapés. Architect Friedrich Hetzelt and an Italian colleague simply sign off the building and it's ready to move in.  

But the Italian ambassador barely has time to get his feet under the table before the building is bombed. After the war, the Tiergarten diplomatic quarter falls into a deep sleep. Children use the ruins as an adventure playground. Part of one wing is renovated to accommodate the Italian Consulate General.  

1990. After German reunification, Italy is determined to rebuild the embassy. It reopens in 2003, part of a brand new embassy district in the Tiergarten.

",,,"And two on Sundays
75 million eggs? If the thought of eating even one egg for Sunday breakfast is too much for you, you might find it hard to believe that 75 million eggs were once stored in this huge building with the yellow clinker facade. In their typically blunt fashion, Berliners call this cold storage warehouse the ""Eierspeicher"", or ""egg store"". It opened in 1929 in the Osthafen dock area as a logistics hub for the city's egg trade.

Along with handling 450 truckloads of eggs, the warehouse also has plenty of space for other chilled goods, such as 8,000 tonnes of frozen meat, game and poultry. The facility has nine storeys and thousands of cubic metres of storage space, which is kept at -10 to +8 degrees Celsius. It also stores butter, wine, canned goods and deli products. 

Feeding Berlin's millions 

The steel-frame building commissioned by Leipziger Kühltransit AG is a classic example of a modern, purpose-built facility designed for a distribution company in the Twenties: efficient, functional, dull. Around 10 million eggs are consumed in Berlin every day, that's two eggs per person per day. The egg storage warehouse is designed to close a gap in the supply chain. It's a constant source of annoyance to chefs and housewifes alike that eggs go off so quickly, but now they can arrive in the shops in perfect condition. Berlin is growing, and so are the challenges of moving goods around the city. Berliners want fresh food. 

Goods from all over the world 

The cold storage warehouse is mainly a transit hub. Perishable foods from as far afield as Argentina, Austrialia and China arrive here to be repackaged and prepared for onward transit. It has the perfect location, providing easy access by sea, rail and road. Ramps and freight elevators ensure a fast turnaround of goods. 

Form follows function 

The functional, plain block designed by architect Oskar Pusch is inevitably a little short on aesthetic appeal. The building envelope is well insulated, with smooth brickwork on the outside and a 20-cm layer of cork cladding on the inside. There are no windows (except in the stairwell), no wall openings, no sunlight - because if any heat gets in, the energy consumption of the refrigerators and other machinery goes through the roof. The architect tries to brighten up the exterior by adding a coloured clinker facade, but the beauty of this imitation Gothic ornamentation is very much in the eye of the beholder. Don't be fooled by the glass frontage that you can see on both sides of the building. The glass was added during renovations in 2001 to try to break up the monotony of this brick monolith. The Universal Music Group moved into the building in 2002. At least they don't have to worry about sound insulation!
",The area around the building on the banks of the Spree is open to the public,"Sculptor Olaf Metzel uses the police barriers piled up between the former egg storage warehouse and the granary next door to create an installation called 13.4.1981.

",,,"The people’s theatre brings education to the people
Rudolf Werner is a bag of nerves. He prowls up and down his dressing room. He knows his lines, his costume fits well - but he is racked with stage fright. Tonight is a special night. The actor is about to go on stage to play Götz von Berlichingen to celebrate the opening of the new Volksbühne people's theatre. ""Long live freedom!"" Goethe's words will soon be ringing out across the auditorium.

But, today of all days, a technical problem ruins plans for the opening of this state-of-the art theatre. The revolving stage isn't working. A last-minute decision is taken to perform When the Young Wine Blossoms by Björnstjerne Björnson instead. But this comedy from the company's repertoire doesn't really reflect the theatre's political stance.  

Take a close look at the building in front of you. Every single brick was paid for by workers' hard-earned pennies. The Freie Volksbühne association (Free People's Theatre) was established in Berlin in 1890. It was the first cultural/political organisation to be set up by working-class members, who scrimped and saved to build this temple of the theatre.  Their somewhat militant slogan was: ""Bring art to the people!"". 

These words written by Dr Bruno Wille in an article in the Berliner Volksblatt on 23 March 1890 led to the founding of the Freie Volksbühne. Wille and theatre director Otto Brahm were the driving force behind the new association. It had a clear aim: workers who are usually denied access to culture for financial reasons should be able to afford to enjoy the theatre and its educational benefits. The Freie Volksbühne initially puts on plays in private theatres that support the association's aims. It charges its members 50 pfennigs to go in. Members can enter a draw to win seats in a box or on the balcony. Class boundaries become blurred as the proletariat emancipates itself and appropriates the theatre culture of the bourgeoisie. 

One of the side effects is the promotion of contemporary works that criticise society  

One of the unique features of the Freie Volksbühne benefits contemporary authors such as Gerhard Hauptmann. The association's productions are classed as private events, so Prussian censors can't get their hands on the scripts. The police decide to send their informers in to spy on the radical cultural association. The authorities hear they are staging socially critical plays - tales of working-class life spoken in dialect, the language of the people.  

In 1912, the members of the association - which at its height number almost 160,000 - decide to build their own theatre. They appoint famous theatre architect Oskar Kaufmann, who helps them to build their own theatre under the most trying of circumstances. When the foundation stone is laid in September 1913, nobody imagines that it will be built while the First World War is raging. 

The 2,000-seat Volksbühne theatre is built in the heart of the poor Scheunenviertel district. The association's members are bringing theatre to the people.  

Götz von Berlichingen hits the stage in the New Year   

Rudolf Werner gets to play Götz a few days later. The local press is kind about the debacle on the opening night: ""According to superstition, a little bad luck at the start of an undertaking is an omen of its future success."" How right they are!

",,,"Global symbol of modernism
The Weiße Stadt (White City), constructed in Reinickendorf from 1929 to 1931, belongs to the UNESCO six Berlin Modernism estates.

In the late 1920s, Martin Wagner, Berlin's chief urban planner, has a problem. He introduced a rent tax in 1924 to fund social housing. Now, with the economic situation rapidly worsening, revenues from the tax are falling. But he still has to build more residential housing - with an especially urgent need for small flats.

More space for experiments

Using 15 million Reichsmark from current budget resources, Wagner launches a special building fund. The rent tax funding always comes with conditions. But with the new fund, architects no longer have to adhere, for instance, to rooms of a specified size or a defined floor height. With more freedom in planning, this is an attractive project.

Wagner commissions three architects - Wilhelm Büning, Bruno Ahrends and Otto Rudolf Salvisberg - to construct over 1200 new apartments along Schillerpromenade (today's Aroser Allee) in the Reinickendorf district.

Yet despite the greater leeway in planning, the number one priority is still a cost-saving design. The simplest way to save money is to standardise all prefabricated structural elements such as doors, windows and staircases. The three architects also agree on 9.40 metres as the uniform depth of all the buildings.

One of these cost-saving measures also determines the appearance of the estate. With uniform plain white facades, the estate has a unique distinguishing feature. Very soon it is nicknamed the Weiße Stadt - the White City.

White houses in three variations

Salvisberg is responsible for the overall urban development of the estate. His plan foresees a network of communal green spaces amid a mix of block buildings fronting the streets and rows of houses. Salvisberg's bridge house across today's Aroser Allee forms the centre of the estate.

The estate's best-known image is still the view down this avenue. If you approach from Emmentaler Straße, you first see the gatehouse-like buildings designed by Ahrends. With their five storeys, they tower over the other buildings, giving the estate an almost fortress-like appearance.

On its four rows of columns, the 40-metre-wide bridge building by Otto Rudolf Salvisberg stands majestically in the centre of Aroser Allee. The reinforced concrete construction has a surprising elegance, seemingly almost suspended between the rows of houses to the right and left.

Architect Wilhelm Büning focuses primarily on plans for rows of houses, positioning the rows radially in a fan-shape between Genfer Straße and the Schillerring. His large framed windows for the stairwells are a conspicuous feature, while the broad coloured eaves set the roofs off from the white façades.

Shortly after completion, the Weiße Stadt is already viewed as a successful example of a modern housing estate. Photos of the white façades are published in the international press. Damage to the buildings during the Second World War is repaired under Wilhelm Büning from 1949 to 1954. In 2008, the Schillerpromenade estate is inscribed as UNESCO World Heritage.

"Matthäikirchplatz 4-6, 10785 Berlin",52.508333,13.367778,History,1,FALSE,Kulturforum,"A fascinatingly diverse ensemble of architecture, art and culture between Potsdamer Platz and the Landwehr Canal.
",,,"A meeting place for art, music and science
The Kulturforum has its roots in the West Berlin of the 1960s and 1970s - and in three buildings by two internationally renowned architects. Hans Scharoun's Philharmonie, opened in 1963, marked the start of a new development to the west of Potsdamer Platz. The concert hall's striking tent-like roof and golden façade contrast sharply with Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's functional form and clear lines for the Neue Nationalgalerie (New National Gallery) opened five years later.

Looking around the open spaces at the heart of the Kulturforum, you can't help but notice the nineteenth-century St. Mathew's Church - very much a building from a different era.

A diversity of the arts

In the early 1970s, Hans Scharoun designs the Berlin State Library - the Staatsbibliothek - which opens in 1978 on the other side of Potsdamer Straße. The library, together with the neighbouring building housing the Ibero-American Institute (IAI), belongs to Scharoun's major works only finished after his death in 1972. With costs for work on constructing the State Library spiralling, the other building projects on the Kulturforum are put on hold.

It is some time before Edgar Wisniewski, who worked with Scharoun for many years, can finally oversee the construction of the Museum of Musical Instruments and the Chamber Music Hall, both based on Scharoun's original plans. The museum opens in 1984 and the Chamber Music Hall three years later in 1987 - punctually for Berlin's 750th anniversary celebrations.

The changing face of museum architecture 

The Kulturform, set so close to the Wall, is a prestige project for West Berlin. It has a twofold aim - not just setting a new benchmark in the constant competition with the GDR, but also sending out a clear message to West Germany. Many art works and literature archives were taken out of Berlin for safe storage during the war. Now, though, their return is slow and sporadic. With this series of high-profile buildings, West Berlin hopes to add to the pressure to accelerate the process.

As early as 1965, West Berlin announces an international architectural competition for the entire Kulturforum. The expectations are high. The winning design should do nothing less than ""define the architectural essence of what a museum means for us today"".

In the jury's view, none of the plans realise this ambitious goal. Finally, they agree on the work of Stuttgart architect Rolf Gutbrot as a compromise solution.

His plans date from a time of questioning the tasks and functions of museum architecture. How do a museum and the collection it houses mutually influence one another? Which target groups are to be addressed?

Gutbrodt sees his designs as a deliberate contrast to the neo-classicist and neo-baroque museums on East Berlin's Museum Island. Rather than intimidating visitors, his museums are intended to attract people from all walks of life.

By 1985, when the Museum of Decorative Arts (Kunstgewerbemuseum) opens, the design envisaged twenty years before seems outdated. Public reaction is muted, while the most outspoken critics condemn the building as a ""concrete bunker"". Criticism reaches such a pitch that Gutbrod is taken off projects for the other new buildings at the Kulturforum. Yet again, it seems there is no clear plan for the Kulturforum's future.

Then Munich architects Heinz Hilmer and Christoph Sattler are commissioned to overhaul Gutbrod's designs for the Museum of Graphic Arts and the Art Library. They change numerous details, for instance, removing the exposed concrete pillars in the exhibition hall. The museum and Art Library are opened in 1994. Today, the façade with its concrete and clinker brink cladding seems empathically low-key.

Hilmer and Sattler also designed the Gemäldegalerie, which houses an outstanding collection of European art from the thirteenth to the eighteenth century. In their plan, rather than creating prestige facades, they focused on the quality of the interior design. Their generous exhibition rooms with perfect lighting allow visitors to enjoy the Gemäldegalerie's exquisite collection to the full.

",,,"Righteous Among the Nations
27 February 1943, Rosenthaler Straße 39. Gestapo trucks are parked in front of a workshop for brushes and brooms. The Jewish workers, most blind and deaf, climb into the trucks and are whisked away. Otto Weidt, the owner of a small factory workshop, is furious. Shortly afterwards, he is ready to leave. His destination - the Gestapo's Department of Jewish Affairs.

The afternoon of the same day, passers-by see a very odd spectacle. Around 50 men and women are walking down Rosenthaler Straße towards the workshop for brooms and brushes. The group is led by Otto Weidt. Just like the others, he is almost blind. Later, writer Inge Deutschkron recalls, ""It was like a scene from an ancient tragedy.""  She also works for Otto Weidt. Just as he has several times before, he manages to convince the Gestapo of how vital his workers are for the war effort.  

Freedom for a time 

Brushes and brooms can save lives. At the start of the war, they are declared essential to the war effort. The Wehrmacht, the German army, is one of the largest clients of Otto Weidt's little broom factory. For a long time, he can protect his blind workers, many of them Jews, from Nazi persecution. He brings many of his workers here from factories with brutal and inhumane conditions. In his workshop, they can demonstrate their skills - and survive.  

On an old photograph, Otto Weidt is sitting surrounded by his employees. They call him ""Papa Weidt"". Otto Weidt is a pacifist. He loathes the Nazis - and wants to help the people they persecute. 

During Hitler's dictatorship, more than 1700 Jews survive underground in Berlin - thanks to helpers such as Otto Weidt. These helpers become known as ""Silent Heroes"". Today, Otto Weidt is also honoured in Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations.  

The survivors hidden in Berlin include later journalist and author Inge Deutschkron. Down the years, apart from her work as a writer, Inge Deutschkron gives many talks in schools to keep alive the awareness of the persecution and murder of the European Jews. In the late 1990s, when a group of students discover the empty rooms of Otto Weidt's old workshop by chance, Inge Deutschkron immediately wants to help. With her support, an exhibition is held in these historic rooms.  

A cupboard as a refuge 

As you come into the exhibition, the floorboards creak at every step. The workshop is one small room after another. The last room seems to end with a cupboard against the wall. But carry on! Behind the cupboard door built on at the front, there's a secret doorway to another room. Without windows in the room, the atmosphere is oppressive. For many months, this is where Otto Weidt hides all four members of the Horn family. At that time, a cupboard with a double door stands in front of the little box room. It is a safe hiding place - until an informer betrays him to the Gestapo. In October 1943, the Horn family is arrested during a raid on the workshop. A little later, they are murdered in Auschwitz. This time, they are beyond Otto Weidt's help.

"Bachstraße 111, 10555 Berlin",52.51468,13.33594,History,1,FALSE,Weltbaum by Ben Wagin,"Berlin hangs onto a masterpiece of street art &shy;- by replanting it
",,,"The story of a mural
4 May 2018. Ben Wagin is overjoyed as he watches a group of young artists standing on scaffolding recreating his mural Weltbaum (World Tree). They are painting it on the end of a building in Lehrter Straße in Berlin's Moabit district. The longest branch reaches 20 metres towards the sky. The artists are relocating one of Berlin's most famous pieces of graffiti. The original is three kilometres away and about to disappear behind a new building. Street art is ephemeral. But it's also spontaneous and flexible.

The performance artist Ben Wagin was born Bernhard Wargin in 1930 and has lived in Berlin since 1957. His artistic career began with the construction of the Wall. He began planting trees all over the city and became known as the ""godfather of trees"". His trees can be found in front of ministries, theatres and museums, but his art always has a political flavour.  

A pioneer of the modern street art scene 

On 9 November 1990, Wagin creates an installation called The Parliament of Trees on the former border strip. He dedicates the trees to the victims of the Berlin Wall. They commemorate the division of Germany and the struggle for German unity.  

Ben Wagin likes to plant ginkgo trees and, so far, has planted more than 50,000 all over the world. With his art and other projects, he is trying to make people think about the relationship between mankind and nature.  

He also paints, including his now famous Weltbaum mural in Berlin, which he created in 1975. At that time, words like street art and graffiti hadn't yet been invented and no-one talked about murals. Wagin created one of Berlin's first large-scale murals. He's a pioneer, a role model for future generations of street artists. And every day, tens of thousands of Berlin's residents and visits see his art as they travel around the city.  

Passengers can look out of the window at Tiergarten S-Bahn station and admire Weltbaum I - Grün ist Leben. It adorns the wall of Siegmunds Hof 21, on the corner of Bachstraße. The tree screams in agony as exhaust gases from the machine beneath choke it to death. A barge sails across the top of the picture. It is loaded with trees - a gloomy vision of the future. We are destroying our natural world.  

A tree is on the move 

The Weltbaum in Tiergarten is getting on in years and the paint is starting to fade. But it's still a shock for the artist when he discovers that the tree is going to be covered over by a new building. A high-rise office building is going up on the empty plot in front of the mural. The tree has disappeared from view. There's just a narrow gap between the new building and the painting.  

It's time for a change - why not relocate the tree? In spring 2018 the Weltbaum is moved from Tiergarten to its new home in Moabit.
",Freely accessible,"In 1933, many artists live in the area around Savignyplatz, including the poet Mascha Kaléko, painter Georg Grosz and writer Else Ury. Another Weltbaum by Ben Wagin at the Savignyplatz S-Bahn station is a reminder of key events in German history and, above all, acts as a memorial to the Berlin Jews who were persecuted at the hands of the Nazis.

",,,"A gap in the Iron Curtain
When you stand on the busy platform at Friedrichstraße station it's hard to imagine that this was formerly the border between East and West Berlin. The rumble of the incoming trains, the clang of the doors as they close - everything's so normal. But between 1961 and 1989 things were very different.

The station is known as a super checkpoint - and with good reason. It is watched by Stasi surveillance cameras and patrolling border guards.  

Next stop: Freedom     

It provides a relatively easy way for visitors from West Berlin to travel into the Eastern sector. But anyone who steps onto the platform on the East Berlin side has already endured a series of humiliating checks before finally being allowed to leave. Locals call the station the Tränenpalast, the Palace of Tears, because it has seen so many tearful goodbyes. It's a strange place where you leave your family behind - but freedom beckons. 

Border crossing for spies and stowaways  

Every day, spies mingle with the bustling crowds. This is where they can move between the two sectors. Informers for the East German regime avoid the checkpoints by passing through a small glass pavilion on the corner of Friedrichstraße and Reichstagsufer.  

17-year-old Karl-Heinz Richter is also dreaming of sneaking across the border. This high school student is one of a small group of teenagers who have discovered a gap in the border fence on the railway line. One by one, they attempt their escape by climbing onto the bridge and hiding in an alcove until the Moscow to Paris Express passes by. The train drivers are instructed to pull out of the station as fast as they can to prevent stowaways from leaping on, but just a few metres further on they have slowed again. This allows nine boys to leap onto the steps of the train and smuggle themselves across the border. 

Press coverage in the West, punishment in the East   

Even the Western press picks up the story and reports on the schoolboys' escape. It is 30th January 1964. Karl-Heinz and his friend Frankie have thought of everything - except the two border guards who are having a cigarette break directly beneath their hiding place. When they move away, the boys manage to hop onto the footboard of the very last carriage. But Karl-Heinz slips, falls off and can only stare after the receding red lights of the train as it carries Frankie off to freedom. In his desperate flight from the border guards, he breaks both legs, several ribs and an arm - and in the end is arrested, despite his severe injuries. He spends many months in a Stasi prison, and is finally granted permission to leave East Germany in 1975.   

By then, Friedrichstraße station had been fortified still further in order to prevent any more escape attempts.
",,"Cheap schnaps, cigarettes, chocolates - the Intershops in the station tempt visitors from West Berlin with duty-free products that they can buy without having to go through East German border controls. It's a nice little earner for the socialist system. With an annual turnover close to 80 million West German marks (1977), the regime decides to allow a little capitalism.

",,,"Buried far from home
On the morning of 30 April 1945, shots rip through the air near Potsdam Bridge. The final battle for Berlin is raging in the city centre. A little girl cowers helplessly next to a dead Red Cross nurse. 23-year-old Soviet soldier Nikolai Ivanovich Massalov screws up his courage, crawls to the bridge and rescues the crying child from the hail of bullets.

It's not unusual for heroes to be recognised for their courage - but the honour bestowed on Sergeant of the Guard Massalov takes on a whole new dimension. The story of his daring act reaches Yevgeny Vuchetich, whom the Soviet military administration commissions in 1946 to create a memorial to the fallen Soviet soldiers. After hearing the story, the sculptor decides to create a massive statue of a Red Army soldier carrying a child in his arms.  

A Red Army soldier standing over a broken swastika  

The memorial in Treptower Park is inaugurated on 8 May 1949, the fourth anniversary of the end of war. All eyes are drawn to the huge statue inspired by the heroic deed at Potsdam Bridge. Vuchetich's soldier stands on a high pedestal on the mausoleum hill - the imposing bronze figure is 30 metres tall. With his sword lowered and a shattered swastika beneath his boots, the statue symbolises victory over the Nazis and the hope of a future lived in freedom. 

Covering some 100,000 square metres, the main Soviet War Memorial in Treptower Park is the largest in Germany, but it was not the first to be built. A memorial was constructed in the Tiergarten in November 1945, and the Schönholzer Heide and Buch memorials in Pankow were erected in 1947. All four complexes also house war cemeteries. Around 80,000 Red Army soldiers were killed in the battle for Berlin, and more than 20,000 have found their final resting place at one of these four memorials. 

Like a film set  

The Tiergarten, Treptow and Schönholzer Heide memorials are all built in a monumental style and reflect the grandiose stylistic ideals of Soviet realism. The sheer size of the memorial in Treptower Park is perhaps the most obvious example of this aesthetic. With its arched entrances, huge flags carved from red granite and an impressive view of Vuchetich's colossal statue, the complex looks like a set for a film about the Soviet era.  

Today, more than 70 years after it was built, the huge statue still amazes visitors from all over the world. We still don't know the name of the girl who is immortalised in the arms of the bronze soldier. Her saviour, Nikolai Ivanovich Massalov, died on 10 December 2001 in Kemerovo, Siberia.

",,,"Uncle Pelle’s funfair
Fabian, the protagonist of Erich Kästner's novel of the same name, sets out on an ""adventure"" in Wedding, a poor, working-class district of Berlin. There's not a lot to see in Wedding, so Fabian visits the Nordpark funfair in Müllerstraße. Nordpark is squeezed into a gap ""between old, solid tenement buildings"", writes Erich Kästner. When he gets there, it's in ""semi-darkness"", the paths are ""sticky"" and many of the attractions are shoddy or not even running. It's true that Fabian meets a woman with whom he is destined to have a brief fling, but the trip to the funfair is not exactly an exciting adventure. The prevailing mood is one of sadness.

Nordpark is portrayed quite differently in Curt Moreck's Führer durch das lasterhafte Berlin, a guide to ""naughty"" Berlin. He describes Nordpark as a ""meeting place and stomping ground for pleasure-seekers, a piece of real Berlin.""  Another travel guide says: ""Give the people of Berlin their funfair and they're happy, they find everything 'knorke'.  That's Berlin slang for 'awesome'! 

In the 1920s, funfairs are popular with people on low incomes. They can be found in all of Berlin's poorer, working-class districts. In July 1925 Nordpark offers a riding track called the Hippodrome, sideshows, a swing ride, a carousel, shooting galleries and a wheel of fortune with sausages as prizes. Funfairs are particularly popular with children and teenagers. 

A harmless pleasure?  

But many journalists and child welfare organisations think they are anything but harmless. A broad alliance of educationalists, clergymen, youth welfare workers, social workers and police are united in their opposition to funfairs, calling them hotbeds of vice, squalor and immorality. They are particularly enraged by the games of chance and sideshow attractions. For their part, the showmen defend the entertainment they offer, saying the criticism reflects the paternalism and arrogance of the cultural elites. 

A harmless clown? 

The Nordpark is particularly popular with children, because its operator, Adolf Rautmann, is the creator of the much-loved clown Uncle Pelle. He delights younger guests at local festivals and fairs. Indeed, the Uncle Pelle character is so successful that Adolf Rautmann protects it by patent. Once the patent expires, other clowns carry on using the name Uncle Pelle until the Fifties.  

Adolf Rautmann is not just a clown; he's also a businessman. He runs several fairgrounds and entertainment venues in Berlin and works hard to defend the interests of Berlin's showmen. But even seemingly harmless clowns have their political views. Adolf Rautmann was a card-carrying National Socialist from the early 1930s.

",,,"The world’s one-and-only disarmament minister
Rainer Eppelmann is going to die. It's been decided. A little tampering with his car followed by a fake accident - the Ministry for State Security has the assassination all planned out. The drama unfolds in the mid-1980s when Eppelmann, the pastor at the Church of the Good Samaritan, is driving his Trabant over a crossroads in East Berlin. A car pulls out in front of him and the collision causes Rainer Eppelmann to fly head first through the windscreen.

A few years earlier, young people are dancing to blues music in the Church of the Good Samaritan in Friedrichshain. Someone is reading from the Bible, everyone feels free to enjoy themselves. It's not quite the normal image of the German Democratic Republic. But the Blues Masses held by the Samaritan church in East Berlin, are something special. They have been going on since 1979, giving young people a chance to escape the restrictions of living in the GDR - at least for the duration of the service. It's all thanks to their organiser, Rainer Eppelmann.  

He is not only the pastor at the Church of the Good Samaritan but also a committed pacifist, conscientious objector and member of the opposition movement in his community. He is not one to mince his words when it comes to political grievances. He has been a thorn in the side of the East German regime for years. When he publishes his Berlin Appeal in 1982 calling for disarmament in both East and West it's seen as a milestone along the road to peaceful revolution - and Eppelmann is now considered an enemy of the state. 

A tradition of rebellion 

Even during the days of National Socialism, the Church of the Good Samaritan is at the heart of the opposition movement based around the Confessing Church's Emergency Covenant of Pastors. Under the GDR the church becomes a nucleus of the peace movement and the birthplace of one the country's largest opposition groups. This is all helped along by the popular Blues Masses.  

And Rainer Eppelmann? He breaks several vertebrae in his neck but survives the crash. He is slowly recovering when his career takes an unexpected turn. In May 1989, his church's Peace Circle takes part in a campaign to expose electoral fraud during municipal elections in East Germany. After the fall of the Berlin Wall, Eppelmann becomes one of the founding members of Democratic Awakening (DA), a political party that merges with the CDU in 1990. 

""We had won""

Following the first and last free elections to the GDR People's Chamber on 18 March 1990, Eppelmann becomes the country's first Minister for Disarmament and Defence. One of his main tasks is the dissolution of the National People's Army - a source of great satisfaction to a pacifist like Eppelmann.  He remains in office from 12 April to 2 October 1990 and to this day, Rainer Eppelmann is the only disarmament minister the world has ever seen.  

Today Eppelmann lives in Berlin and is chairman of the Federal Foundation for the Study of Communist Dictatorship in East Germany. In an interview in 2009, he talks of the moment he appeared before the GDR's generals in his new role as minister of disarmament: ""...that was the first time it really hit home: we had won"".

As a teenager he regularly annoys the People's Police with his punk outfits, and he likes to disagree with his teachers in civics class.

",,,"A turbulent history of freedom
When you approach the former Bethanien Hospital from Muskauer Straße, you might think you're entering a Disney fairy-tale. But, in fact, the building has had a turbulent history since it was built between 1845 and 1847. It has been the scene of many struggles for freedom and independence.

It started life as a Central Deaconess Institute and Hospital commissioned by King Frederick William IV of Prussia. It was always said that the King ""only wants to build churches"", which should be ""islands of promise"", but with the new hospital in Köpenick, the monarch sent a signal that public health was also important to him in the industrial age. 

In the mid-19th century, Bethanien was set amongst gardens and rye fields - ""surrounded by greenery"", which was just how His Majesty liked it. His royal preferences were also reflected in the building's architecture. Today, the imposing entrance hall looks more like a church than a hospital. The hospital housed 500 beds, a nursing school and an orphanage.  

Barbarism or freedom?  

But just a year later, the bloody March Revolution reaches this haven of tranquillity. Theodor Fontane, a pharmacist in Bethanien at the time, notes: ""... the very day I moved into Bethanien, the militias were fighting on the Köpenick fields, then the people stormed the armoury, and there were alternating calls of 'The Russians are coming' and 'The Poles are coming'. The former were synonymous with the collapse of barbarism, the latter with the establishment of freedom."" 

In 1933, the deaconesses are put to the test when the National Socialists try to turn the management of the hospital over to members of their party. But the deaconesses fight back and maintain their independence. Eight years later, the establishment is placed under the authority of the National Socialists' welfare organisation, but time is already running out. Bethanien is badly damaged during the Second World War.  

The battle for Bethanien continues 

The reconstruction work lasts until 1966, but things are rapidly going downhill. The hospital's location close to the sector border means patients no longer come from East Berlin. It closes down in 1970, but the fight for Bethanien is not over. Now there are plans to tear down this magnificent complex. The building is saved after massive protests by conservationists and public campaigns. In 1969, the complex is listed as a historical monument.  

On 19 December 1971, after a concert by the rock group Ton Steine Scherben, squatters move into the nurses' home, the Martha-Maria-Haus. They rename it the Georg-von-Rauch-Haus after a Berlin anarchist and urban guerrilla who had been killed in a confrontation with police the previous year.  

After much debate, the Berlin Senate finally approves the squatters' legal right to occupy the building. In 1973, artists' groups manage to turn Bethanien itself into a centre for cultural and social projects.  

In 2005, the Yorck59 Group occupies the south wing of Bethanien to prevent the sale of the complex to a private investor. Some 25 social and cultural groups currently use the Bethanien site. We can assume that the deaconesses' former hospital will see many more struggles for freedom in the future.

""The most perfect work of art is the creation of political freedom.""  It is with these words that Konrad Adenauer opens the first meeting of the Bundesrat in Bonn in 1949.  

A clear lesson has been learned from National Socialism. It is vital to prevent the re-emergence of a centralised power that neutralises politics and sweeps aside democracy and freedom. The Bundesrat is an important instrument here, as it represents the federal system that underpins Germany's 16 federal states. It acts as an important bridge between the country's federal and state governments.  

The Bundesrat has 69 members, including the minister-presidents or mayors of the various states. The main task of this constitutional body is to participate in the legislative process. Hundreds of laws pass through the Bundesrat every year.  

Moving to Berlin 

Shortly after reunification, the Bundesrat members decide to continue sitting in Bonn. But they soon realise they have made a mistake. If it is to work effectively, the Bundesrat needs to be close to other federal institutions. The decision is revoked - it's time to move to Berlin. 

The Bundesrat moves into the building that once housed the upper chamber of the Prussian parliament in Leipziger Straße. The arrival of this institution breathes new life into the building, which is in the shadow of the Berlin Wall and has stood empty for many years. 

The GDR only used parts of the building, with the foyer serving as a kitchen and the plenary chamber as a storage area. In the year 2000, after many years of renovation work, it finally opens its doors to Members and tour groups. 

The Three Graces 

When you visit the Bundesrat building, your first port of call is the foyer. Three women set the tone here: The Three Graces. This is the name of Rebecca Horn's art installation. These particular Graces come in the shape of pointed staves made of gold-coloured brass hanging down form three dome-shaped openings in the ceiling. The Graces are in constant motion and, the artist explains, act as a link between interior and exterior, above and below. A little reminder for the politicians within?  

Governing Mayor of Berlin Michael Müller has brought the sitting to a close. The work will be continued in the numerous committees and the Council will meet again in a month's time.

",,,"A ministry with a dark history
Joschka Fischer, Germany's first Green Foreign Minister, is holding a gold-plated key. On 19 January 2000, he is symbolically handed the key to the building on Werderscher Markt. Those present gaze at the wood panelling and the luminous ceiling of the Weltsaal, the World Hall. They both date back to the 1930s. Yes, it's true - the Foreign Minister of the new Berlin Republic is based in a building erected by the National Socialists. The relocation of the ministries from Bonn to Berlin after reunification posed some problems for the German government.

In 1991, the decision is made - Germany's federal government is to move from Bonn to Berlin. But where will all the ministries be housed? Civil servants pore over their city maps on the hunt for new premises. The Federal Foreign Office would like to have a prestigious new building, perhaps in the Ministergärten, the green space in the centre of Berlin. But space and budgets are tight.  

The move needs to be professionally managed, so Environment Minister Klaus Töpfer is appointed as relocation officer in 1995. He assigns the Foreign Office an old building on Werderscher Markt. Of all ministries, it is to be the Foreign Office, the one that represents Germany worldwide, that is to move into a building built by the Nazis.   

Tackling history head-on 

You're standing outside the Foreign Office's hall of records. Government limousines and a motorcycle escort are standing by as the gates can open at any time. 

The large sandstone building on the banks of the Spree has had many occupants over the years. The National Socialists built it as the Reichsbank, and this is where they stored the gold that supported the war economy. A little later, it was occupied by the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). This is where General Secretaries Walter Ulbricht and Erich Honecker decided on GDR policy. The SED's massive party emblem was removed from the façade in 1990.  

And now it's home to the Federal Foreign Office? The building's history makes some people feel a little queasy, but relocation manager Töpfer takes it all in his stride. All three eras - National Socialism, the GDR, and the new Berlin Republic have their place in the renovation plans. The architects are very conscious of the building's history but are looking forwards. 

A window on the city  

The Foreign Office is also getting a facelift. A light and airy glass building pops up in front of the old building, which is too small to accommodate all the ministry's staff. It elegantly conceals the view of the Nazis' intimidating architecture. The foyer at the Foreign Office regularly holds exhibitions that are open to the public. The ministry sees itself as a window on the city.  

After the ceremony in the Weltsaal, Joschka Fischer goes to his office on the second floor. This is where the SED General Secretaries once held court. But now the minister and his staff are opening a new chapter in German history.

"Platz der Republik 1, 11011 Berlin",52.518365,13.375511,History,1,FALSE,The Reichstag,"Paul versus Wilhelm - the construction of the Reichstag turns into a duel between architect and Emperor
",,,"The battle for the Reichstag
""A common, ignoble dog"", an ""imperial street urchin"". This is how Paul Wallot, the architect of the Reichstag building, describes Wilhelm II. The Kaiser bosses him around, constantly demanding changes, until there's little left of Wallot's prize-winning design.

As for Wilhelm II, he complains to a friend that the Reichstag under construction is a ""completely failed creation"", and ""the pinnacle of bad taste"". He's not only angry about the building, but also about the institution that will be moving in. As Emperor by the grace of God, he is horrified at the thought of a democratically elected parliament. He displays his contempt for the freely elected representatives of the people, spluttering: ""It's all the same to me whether the monkeys leaping around in this Reichstag cage are yellow, red or black."" Wilhelm II never entered the Reichstag through the West Portal, where you are now standing. Indeed, he only visited the building once after it opened, entering through the Kaiser Portal on the other side. 

Wilhelm, Friedrich and Wilhelm lay the cornerstone  

The problems begin well before the first stone is laid. The Reichstag needs a new building, and Chancellor Bismarck wants to build it outside Berlin. The decision is made to build near the Brandenburg Gate (on the outskirts of the city at the time), but the owner of the existing palace refuses to sell his property. The site only becomes available after his death. Frankfurt architect Paul Wallot wins a contest to design the new building. After the Kaiser himself and his Prussian building department have proposed a string of changes, Wilhelm I finally approves Wallot's plans in December 1883. On 9 June 1884 he turns up to lay the foundation stone, with his heir Friedrich and grandson Wilhelm in tow. Thud, thud, thud - the Emperor and 80 dignitaries perform the three traditional hammer blows.  

No, Your Majesty  

Once Wilhelm II ascends to the throne in 1888 he and the architect are even more at loggerheads. Although he is not the client, the Emperor blithely begins meddling with the project, saying: ""My son, this is how we'll do it"". But Wallot is having none of it: ""Majesty, I can't do that."" 

Their personal animosity hits new heights when they begin arguing about the location of the stone dome. In the democratic tradition of the Age of Metternich, Wallot wants it to act as a symbol for the whole nation. Wilhelm II is already furious that the people's representatives dare to use the ""majestic form of the dome""  in the parliament's architecture, in direct competition with the dome on his palace. He calls for it to be relocated above the western entrance foyer, which you can see behind the tall glass doors. But Wallot stands firm. The supporting walls of the debating chamber are not strong enough to support a stone dome. Undeterred, Wallot's engineer Hermann Zimmermann has a bright idea: a state-of-the-art, technically advanced structure made of steel and glass. It's the perfect way to complete the Reichstag building, just like the present-day dome.   

When the keystone is laid in December 1893, the Emperor has only kind words to say about the building and its architect. But later he blocks Wallot from receiving the recognition he deserves for his work. Emperors can bear grudges too.

",,,"The freedom to pogo
The deafening music pauses for a second. The singer stops yelling into the mic and asks: ""Where's Jenny?"" The punk girl with the colourful Mohican was standing in front of the stage. Now she's disappeared. A hole has opened up in the dance floor.

She's known as Rat Jenny after the rat that she carries around on her shoulder. Now she's fallen through the decrepit floor into the basement below. Despite her injuries, she refuses an ambulance, saying: ""Let's do a deal. I get free entry, and we forget it."" The punk scene has a new hero.

Rage against the Establishment

People like Rat Jenny and Berlin bands such as PVC and Egal turn the SO36 into a Mecca for the city's punks. No God, no State, no Fatherland! Anarchy rules as they flock here to dance, party and drink - furiously and all night long.

The name SO36 comes from the former postcode for Southeast Berlin. The idea is to open a punk club modelled on New York's famous CBGB. But the three founders from Düsseldorf - Schächtele, Brennecke and Rohè - go bust after just four months.

In fact, SO36 is rescued from bankruptcy four times. Things get worse when the artist Martin Kippenberger joins the team and puts up the beer prices. Hard-nosed businessmen and freedom-loving punks are not a good fit.

It is Kippenberger who helps Rat Jenny out of the club, but she falls onto her beer glass. The rest is history - the punk cuts her hand open and responds by slapping the artist's face, with the broken beer glass still in her hand. But it's not true that Kippenberger depicted this incident in his painting Dialogue with the Youth of Today. That actually relates to another brawl.

There's always a battle to fight

The sweat of a thousand clubbers drips off the ceiling. Trouble is always in the air, such as when the club's ticket office is robbed by an action called Kommando gegen Konsumterror. When the club changes its name to Merhaba SO36 and hosts Turkish weddings, the punks still come along. Tolerance is the magic word that means the eclectic mix of concerts, Kiezbingo, Gayhane parties for gay Muslims and many other events continue to this day. And Rat Jenny still gets in for free.

Wera Ostwaldt's telephone rings. It's an architect asking if she would be interested in making new coats of arms for the foyer of Berlin's Kongresshalle. Ostwaldt designed the original enamel panels back in 1956, but now - in 2006 - some have been stolen and others fallen into disrepair. 80-year-old Wera Oswaldt is delighted to take on the job.

An architectural landmark 

Berlin's Kongresshalle (Congress Hall) was built in the late Fifties for the International Building Exhibition. A gift from the United States, it became an iconic symbol of the German/American alliance. Its creator, Hugh A. Stubbins, recalls how he tried out all kinds of designs: ""rectangular, round, square, and so on. After many weeks of work I was sitting on my lawn reading the Sunday Times when the idea suddenly came to me."" 

His creation is still popularly referred to as the ""pregnant oyster"" because of the hall's suspended roof that curves gently over the auditorium. Wera Oswaldt remembers when she first clapped eyes on it: ""That symbolic roofline, sweeping out into the world - and the huge staircase really impressed me."" In 1956 she is proud to be asked to produce the enamel coats of arms that are to be placed on the building's inauguration plaque. She's even a guest of honour when the foundation stone is laid.  

A centre of openness and tolerance 

During the Cold War, John F. Kennedy, Henry Kissinger and Jimmy Carter give speeches in the Hall. The Bundestag occasionally sits here, and the building also hosts the Berlin Film Festival. Until one morning in May 1980, when part of the roof collapses during a press conference. Several people are injured, and one man later dies of his injuries.  

The renovation and reconstruction work lasts several years. The Haus der Kulturen der Welt (House of World Cultures) moves into the Pregnant Oyster in 1989. It is a place of international cultural exchange - a venue for contemporary art, film, literature and music from all over the world, and a centre for academic discourse.  

In July 2006, further renovation and conversion work begins on the former Kongresshalle. The building is closed for a year - long enough for Wera Oswaldt to re-create the three coats of arms of the original donors: the Federal Eagle, the Berlin Bear and the US Eagle. The building reopens on 21 August 2007. The enamel coats of arms shine like new.

"Hauptstraße 8, 10317 Berlin",52.49505,13.48592,History,1,FALSE,Rummelsburg Memorial,"Escape helpers, failed escapees, opponents of the regime - this is where their dreams of freedom are shattered
",,,"Where thoughts run free but the body is in chains
Walk a few metres off the road and you're in the grounds of the municipal workhouse, which opened in 1879. With these few steps, free thinkers are turned into criminals. Because after 1951 the authorities no longer make a distinction between political prisoners and criminals in this prison. Everyone who ends up here feels the heavy hand of the regime. 

When Hartmut Richter enters Rummelsburg in 1971, he thinks the worst is now behind him. He has already spent 13 months suffering at the hands of the Stasi for helping people to escape to the West. He successfully smuggled 33 people across the border in the boot of his car, but it all went wrong with numbers 34 and 35. The authorities discovered them.  

What he doesn't know is that the regime has turned the former workhouse and National Socialist collection point for ""anti-social"" elements into a brutal prison. Behind its walls, inmates are now subject to the new rules of the GDR's penal system: security, work and education - whatever the cost. The State Security Service, known as the Stasi, is responsible for the ""political operational processing"" of the prisoners and has its own employees and informers on the premises. Male prisoners are no longer guarded by trained staff but by the Vopos (Volkspolizei, the East German police) - with a dangerous mix of military drills and arbitrary punishments. 

Resistance is futile  

Hartmut Richter repeatedly protests against the prison's inhumane conditions and even goes on hunger strike. But it is impossible to fight the system. Solitary confinement, violence, chaining, endless interrogations and forced labour for state-owned companies are all part of daily prison life. The Vopos make no distinction between 'real' criminals and political prisoners, indeed quite the opposite. 

Peaceful protests are met with police brutality  

On 7 and 8 October 1989, Rummelsburg becomes a ""central collection point"" for the Stasi. Anyone who takes part in peaceful demonstrations in East Berlin - and even innocent passers-by - can be arbitrarily arrested and carted off. The regime displays its brutality by forcing the detainees to stand for hours in overcrowded garages on the prison grounds, faces to the wall, hands up, legs spread. Anyone who collapses with exhaustion immediately feels the thwack of a police baton. Anyone who closes their eyes is yelled at. No-one is allowed to visit the toilet, they simply have to go where they stand. The drama increases when they are herded to the cells in the basement. 46 men are packed into 16 square metres. In desperation, women beg to be allowed home to their children, who have been left alone for hours. But sympathy is as rare as the oxygen in this confined space. After hours of interrogation, most of them are finally released. 

Today, three five-metre-high steles commemorate the prison's three eras. The rust-coloured stele symbolises the imperial period, the matt grey the Nazi period, and the shiny grey the GDR era.

The Amerika-Haus opened to great fanfare on 5 June 1957. It takes precisely 8 years and 8 months for it to become the target of anti-American protests. An attack on a friendly protecting power in this front-line city! It's a scandal. The opposition demands the resignation of Berlin's Secretary of the Interior, and governing mayor Willy Brandt has to apologise. As for the Americans themselves, they take it all in their stride. Their attitude underlines the fact that this building on Hardenbergstraße has been designed to be an open, tolerant space. It's a place where people even have the freedom to criticise the United States and its policies.  

Turning Nazis into democrats 

The Amerika Haus opens in Kleiststraße in 1946, initially as a reading room. But it quickly expands its programme to include photo exhibitions and jazz concerts. This is where many Berliners hear Louis Armstrong's records for the very first time; where they read the books of William Faulkner, John Steinbeck and F. Scott Fitzgerald.  

In the post-war years, Americans believe that Germans need to learn how to live in freedom according to basic democratic principles. The Amerika Haus is part of this re-education programme - and, of course, a way of disseminating propaganda. But, unlike Nazi propaganda, it aims to provide a ""full and fair picture"". 

A Who's Who of the cultural scene 

In the summer of 1957, the institution moves into the bright, airy building on Hardenbergstraße. A unique cultural programme is soon underway behind the building's walls, which are later to be attacked with Molotov cocktails. Jackson Pollock exhibits his paintings, Günter Grass debates with Uwe Johnson, Pulitzer Prize winner Rita Dove reads her poems, Richard Nixon and Robert Kennedy pay a visit.  

Berliners are free to use the extensive library and attend concerts, theatre performances, film screenings and language courses. This free cultural exchange becomes a key element of the process of democratisation.  

But as protests increase from the mid-1960s onwards, an open house starts to look like a fortress. It is surrounded by high fences and security gates, and roller shutters are installed at the windows. Nowadays, most cultural activities take place at the US Embassy. But new life has recently been breathed into the Amerika Haus. It now houses exhibitions of photography and visual media, along with the State Agency for Civic Education. It is once again a place for open cultural exchange.

",,,"The Big Three in Berlin
August 1954. The Allies have divided Germany and Berlin into four occupation zones. Six metres below the city streets they have laid 450 metres of cable, moved 3,000 tonnes of earth and used 125 tonnes of steel. In August 2012, Werner Sabolewski, a former civilian employee of the East German army, is looking for firewood in the Pasewalk forest - and makes an amazing discovery.

A tribute to the Western powers 

What he finds in the forest takes us back to one of the most exciting stories from the early years of the Cold War: a secret spy tunnel under Berlin. From May 1955 to April 1956, the CIA and Britain's MI6 use the tunnel to listen in on 440,000 of the Soviet army's telephone and telegraph communications. More than half a century later, this top-secret site still exists and is on public display at the Allied Museum in Berlin.  

Why do the Allies have their own museum in Berlin? It is a thankyou to the Western powers for their commitment to restoring democracy and freedom - especially in West Berlin. The former enemies were welcomed as friends during the post-war years, particularly because of their help during the Berlin Airlift of 1948-49. In 1993, with the support of the USA, Great Britain and France, an international commission of experts drew up plans for a museum in honour of the Big Three.  

Helmut Kohl opened the first exhibition at the museum in September 1994, on the eve of the Western powers' final departure from Berlin. The museum is housed in the Outpost Theatre, a former US military cinema, and in the Nicholson Library. These were favourite haunts of US soldiers and their families in the post-war period. The exhibitions focus on the daily lives of the American, British and French communities. 

How can a tunnel be displayed in the museum? 

The museum's many highlights include the last guardhouse from Checkpoint Charlie, a transport aircraft from the days of the Airlift - and, of course, the legendary spy tunnel.  

Part of the tunnel was discovered during motorway construction in 1997 - a seven-metre section of steel tube, large enough to walk through. The steel tube was later transported to the museum for restoration before being put on show. The sections that Werner Sabolweski stumbled across five years later are now held in the Museum's archives. Rainer Lemke, a member of the Pasewalk parish council, comments: ""This is a piece of Cold War history. It's vital that such finds are preserved for posterity."" 

The Allied Museum was officially inaugurated on the 50th anniversary of the Airlift in 1998. By 2006, half a million people had already visited the exhibitions and this figure had doubled by 2013. Plans are underway to move the Museum to a new home in the former Tempelhof Airport in 2020/21. It is likely that the move will attract even more visitors to this unique exhibition dedicated to Germany's post-war history.  

Of course, the section of spy tunnel from the 1950s will move too - taking it a little closer to its original location, the former sector border between Neukölln and Treptow.

",,,"“Anti-art” breaks all the rules
On 21 April 1921, the Berliner Tageblatt reports on the ""aberrations""  being exhibited at an art fair in the Tiergarten district and announces that the artists responsible will be charged with systematic defamation of the German army.

Looking back, it's hardly surprising that Germany is the place where Dadaists end up in court. Founded by Richard Huelsenbeck, Hugo Ball and other artists in Zurich in 1916, the Dada movement finds its most extreme expression in Berlin.  

The legal sequel to the First International Dada Fair at the Dr Otto Burchard Gallery is motivated by exhibits such as a stuffed soldier with a pig's head and the figure of a woman with an Iron Cross on her back. George Grosz and Wieland Herzfelde are fined 300 and 600 Reichsmarks for shattering these wartime taboos.  

Destroying the established order  

The spirit of provocation goes back to the movement's origins in Switzerland. Huelsenbeck, Ball and others seek to sever their connections with existing art forms and advocate total artistic freedom. Rules, discipline and morals are to be replaced with absolute creative freedom and untamed spontaneity. The Dadaists insist that Dada cannot be defined - so there is no need to commit to anything. Their aim is ""anti-art"", the ultimate in freedom.    

The painters, musicians, writers and dancers challenge the authorities and undermine the establishment with their provocative collages, sound poems and performances, and by insulting their audiences. Their aim is ""to frighten people and secure their own freedom"". The movement is not only an entertaining ""laboratory of higher nonsense"" but an unflinching response to the senselessness of the World War that is still raging.  

""A match in a powder keg""   

Dadaism can only emerge in Berlin towards the end of the war. On 12 April 1918, Richard Huelsenbeck presents a Dadaist manifesto at the Berlin Secession, an alternative art association. It has quite an impact. The graphic designer Hannah Höch later describes the effect as ""a match thrown into a powder keg"". Berlin artists are infected by Dada - and now they want to go their own way.  

Raoul Hausmann takes the sound poetry that was invented in Zurich and moves it to the next level. He works with Höch, Grosz and John Heartfield to create the first ever photomontages. The revolutionary use of real photos - and hence real people - makes Dada artworks even more original and heightens their controversy.  

Dadaism in Berlin hits its high point with the First International Dada Fair. After this, interest in Dada gradually wanes (there is no second international fair). But the provocateurs around Huelsenbeck and Grosz have created a new kind of artistic freedom, introduced new ideas, techniques and processes, and paved the way for Surrealism.  

Today, they continue to influence artists and art movements, but something has happened that the Dadaists never wanted - their works can be found in galleries and museums alongside those of ""traditional"" artists. They have become an official part of art history.

19 April 1943. A sunny spring morning. The locals in Berlin are preparing for Adolf Hitler's birthday on 20 April. They want to give the Führer a very special gift. The last night-time air raid was some weeks before. In the green district of Grunewald, far from the spreading workers' quarters in town, the morning is unusually busy. Engines roar. Commands echo. Dogs bark. Goods wagons rattle down the tracks. Where you are standing now, soldiers wrench open the sliding wagon doors, then herd women, men and children into the darkness of the wagons. 

On this 19 April 1943, 681 Jews from Berlin  and its environs are packed into the ""last train"". This is one of the many Holocaust trains leaving the Grunewald goods yard. The first transport left on 18 October 1941 from the tracks here: 1013 people packed into boxcars sent to the occupied territories in the east.  

Platform 17 is detailed for transporting Jewish women, men and children. They are ordered to report here, often first gathered at a collection point in the city. Then they are marched in columns to Grunewald station, led across Berlin, visible to all local residents. The aim is to make Berlin ""Judenfrei"" - ""free of Jews"". The Nazis rob the Jewish population of their dignity and freedom, and their lives.  

The transports for the east usually leave the station weekly, sometimes daily, destined for the ghettos in Lodz, Minsk, Riga and Warsaw. For many deported on these trains, journey's end means a mass execution. From late 1942, the trains only go to the Theresienstadt concentration camp or to Auschwitz. From platform 17 alone, thirty-five trains deliver around 17,000 Jews to the gas chambers of Auschwitz. 

The death business 

For the Deutsche Reichsbahn railway, deportation trains are a business. Rates are charged per kilometre for the people crammed into the wagons: 4 pfennigs for an adult, and 2 pfennigs for a child. Deportations of over 400 people qualify for a group discount. The Jewish communities have to pay for deportation to the ghettos and death camps.  

If you now go onto the platform and walk up and down, you'll see 186 cast iron plates set either side of Gleis 17. They list the dates of the transports in chronological order, and the number of Jews deported. Today, weeds and small trees are growing in the gravel bed of the track. Birds are singing. Nature is reclaiming this platform to hell.
",Open to the public,"The events on 19 April 1943, the day of the deportation shortly before Hitler's birthday, are portrayed in a feature film. It was produced by Artur Brauner, himself a Holocaust survivor. The Last Train from 2006 tells a dramatically moving story. The film is carried by brilliant actors, including Sibel Kekilli and Gedeon Burkhard. But the images can only tell part of the story of the inhuman cruelty people experienced at this location.

",,,"The May demonstrations descend into violence
A shot rings out in the darkness. Outside Hermannstraße 52, a man falls to the ground. It is New Zealand journalist Charles Ewing Mackay, who was shot and killed by police on the night of 4 May 1929. Mackay is not the only victim of what becomes known as Blutmai &shy;- Bloody May.

Two days earlier, on May day, clashes between demonstrators and police were reminiscent of a civil war. The violence escalated because of a ban on demonstrations issued by Berlin's social democrat police chief Karl Zörgiebel. He is prepared to use all his powers to uphold the ban, and only allows rallies to be held indoors. But the communists ignore the ban and organise rallies on the streets of Berlin to mark the proletariat's day of struggle.

First water hoses, then machine guns

In the early hours, demonstrators gather all over Berlin. One procession heads off to Alexanderplatz and gathers in front of Tietz department store. They are awaited by a large police contingent who attack them with water cannons.

The day takes a more dramatic turn in other parts of Berlin. The police frequently and needlessly resort to the use of firearms, and around noon a demonstrator is shot at Hackescher Markt. Social democrat Max Gemeinhardt is shot dead at Kösliner Straße 19 in Wedding when he leans out of his third-floor window to talk to police. This is just the tragic beginning.

Curfew and state of emergency in Berlin's slums 

The protests drag on for days, especially in the area around Hermannstraße. The demonstrators erect barricades using advertising columns here and on Prinz-Handjery-Straße, today's Briesestraße. They smash street lights, cut overhead cables and hijack trams. The chief of police and his commander Magnus Heimannsberg struggle to get a grip on the situation. Zörgiebel issues a curfew and announces a state of emergency.

The police advance with armoured cars, flares and spotlights, firing on balconies and windows. 50-year-old widow Marie Röbner and her friend Mrs Köppen are killed by police bullets on their balcony at Hermannstraße 177.

It takes until the weekend to subdue Berlin's working-class neighbourhoods. By the end of the uprising 33 people have been killed and almost 200 injured. The victims - like journalist Charles Mackay - were mainly innocent bystanders. No policemen sustained gunshot injuries, but they fired close to 11,000 bullets. Their reckless behaviour goes unpunished.

His life takes a dramatic turn when he shoots the writer Walter D'Arcy Cresswell, who is blackmailing him because of Mackay's sexual advances.

",,,"The failed fight for freedom
In 1953, the Soviet Union brutally crushes the popular uprising in East Berlin. While the world looks on helplessly, the occupying forces destroy East Germans' dreams of freedom for decades to come.

Food rationing, night-time power cuts, post-war cities in ruins and an empty public purse. At the start of the Fifties, the mood in East Germany has hit a new low. The planned economy is failing to deliver results quickly enough. High reparation costs and the collectivisation of agriculture are simply making a difficult supply situation even worse. People are increasingly voting with their feet and leaving East Germany. The situation is explosive.   

The big bang, when it finally comes, is triggered by the SED leadership's announcement in May 1953 that there would be a 10% increase in work quotas. This means that already underpaid workers have to work even longer hours for the same meagre wages. This provocative decision by the Politburo proves to be the final straw that sends workers to the barricades. 

SED officials thrown into cesspools   

The rebellion starts in the provinces. On 12 June 1953, protests break out in many small towns. Mayors are stripped of their office, SED officials are beaten up and even thrown into cesspools. In the Görlitz and Niesky districts citizens even manage to remove the hated SED regime for a few hours.  

Tensions are also starting to build in the capital. On 16 June, construction workers on Stalinallee rush to the aid of colleagues who are allegedly being harassed by the Volkspolizei. They occupy a construction site, move on to the House of Ministries and the protest starts to spread. Thousands of people take to the streets, and now they have more than work quotas on their minds. They are calling for the government to step down, for free elections, press freedom and the release of political prisoners.  

That same day, the Politburo advises the government to repeal the controversial new work quotas, but it's too late. Years of accumulated rage have caused the situation to escalate, with tragic consequences. On the morning of 17 June the protests spread to the whole of the GDR. The Soviet occupiers have been steering East Germany's political fortunes since the end of the war with a strict process of Stalinisation. Now they can't afford to lose control with the eyes of the world upon them. 

Death sentences and Siberian labour camps    

During the night of 17 June, Soviet army units march on Berlin and the crackdown begins. The protest that was fuelled by hope quickly becomes a bloodbath as tanks clear the city's streets and squares. 34 demonstrators are shot and killed by soldiers and the Volkspolizei. The Soviets execute insurgents and sentence hundreds more to detention in forced labour camps in Siberia. Later on, estimates suggest that GDR judges imprison another 1,600 insurgents.  

The SED uses the rebellion as an opportunity to purge its own ranks. Moderates lose their jobs and mass surveillance increases. From now on, it becomes more and more difficult for dissidents and opponents to oppose the regime. It will be another 36 years before GDR citizens finally overthrow their oppressors.
",,"At first, the United States thinks the popular uprising is a trick being perpetrated by the Soviet Union. It believes the USSR is simply looking for an excuse to take over the whole of Berlin. Later, the USA is convinced that the GDR government staged the uprising and then lost control.

",,,"A slip of the tongue opens the border
Just before 7pm, Günter Schabowski puts on his glasses and announces the introduction of a new policy on the freedom to travel. At East Germany's International Press Centre, he suddenly has the attention of every journalist in the room.

Günter Schabowski is a professional. He trained as a journalist, so he knows how to grab people's attention and make his point. Despite this, the first part of his press conference on 9 November 1989 is almost unbearable. He drones on, and the members of the international press corps are nodding off. 

Schabowski has a plan 

But what they don't know is that Egon Krenz, General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED), has just passed Schabowski a draft resolution from the Council of Ministers. ""This will cause a sensation"", Krenz assures him. He is talking about the fact that East Germans are to be given greater freedom to travel abroad. The regime hopes this will stop the current mass exodus.  

But Schabowski wants to wait until the end of the press conference to play his trump card. Granting greater freedom to travel is an admission that the regime has been unable to gain the lasting loyalty of its citizens. 

An accidental bombshell 

Italian journalist Riccardo Ehrmann finally asks about the initial set of travel regulations, which were still full of restrictions, and which had led to massive protests a few days earlier: ""Wasn't it a mistake for you to publish these draft travel regulations on Monday?"" That's the cue for Schabowski to give them the good news. But he is shuffling his notes. Has he lost his nerve? He decides to read out the text of the resolution from the Council of Ministers and ends with the words: ""Permanent emigration may take place via all GDR border crossing points to the Federal Republic of Germany or to Berlin (West)..."" The document doesn't appear to specify when the regulations come into effect. When asked about it, he adds with a touch of irritation: ""As far as I know... effective immediately, without delay..."". 

It's only later that Schabowski realises his words have opened up the border. The document is still being circulated when he makes his announcement - and none of the border guards know anything about it. ""Effective immediately"" should have been ""effective tomorrow"".  

But that's of little concern to the people who hear the news on the Aktuelle Kamera newscast. Hundreds make their way to the border and demand that the barriers be opened. The situation on Bornholmer Strasse is escalating because the border guards have no specific orders. Fortunately, they exercise restraint and no shots are fired. People can now cross into West Berlin.
",Closed to the public,"The East German regime originally planned to announce the new travel regulations on the radio at four in the morning - when most people were asleep. That would have given them a little breathing space. But there was no mention of this in the notes given to Schabowski.

Not only Einstein and Kafka are said to have been seen in Café Nagler, but so are many artists and intellectuals in Germany's Weimar Republic years. Reputedly, this is the birthplace of swing dance in Germany. Today, nothing is left of this famed location in the heart of Berlin, but the parts of the story create a picture transporting us back into the year 1908.

Opening in 1908, Café Nagler offers its guests a variety of entertainment on three floors nearly around the clock - with something for almost every taste. While the ground and first floor house a coffee house and restaurant, the second floor offers a dance floor and events space with secluded booths for lovers, seducers and the seduced.

In the early 1920s, hyperinflation is raging in Germany. With the Kurfürstendamm boulevard's growing pre-eminence as a centre of restaurants and nightlife, coffee house owners Ignaz and Rosa Nagler decide to give up their business and follow their children to Palestine. They move to Haifa in 1924. A branch of the Gutmann milliners, a Mannheim-based women's hatmaker, moves into the converted rooms. The Gutmann company, defined by the Nazis as Jewish, is badly hit by the Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses and has to close as early as August 1933. In the Second World War, the building is seriously damaged in a bombing raid. The ruins are finally demolished in the post-war years.

This example of a lost part of Berlin's everyday life stands for many other fragments in the city. They all need more intensive research in future as elements forming a coherent overall picture of those days.

",,,"Birthplace of a global success
Ernst Josef Aufricht has a problem. With 100,000 Reichsmarks given to him by his father, the young actor has leased the venerable old theatre by the river at Schiffbauerdamm and had it renovated. Now it is due to celebrate its grand reopening on 31 August 1928. But one thing is missing - a play. None of Berlin's top playwrights has anything ready. Then fate steps in and a chance encounter leads to global success.

A back-room encounter 

Aufricht's last hope lies with the Schlichter restaurant in Lutherstraße, a popular haunt of the artistic set. When he steps into the back room, he spots a small man in a grey suit, sitting smoking a cigar. The man is Berthold Brecht. He starts to tells the young theatre producer about a play he's working on. Aufricht is familiar with Brecht and his poems, but he doesn't like the sound of this particular play. But just as they are leaving, Brecht mentions that he is also working on an adaptation of John Gay's Beggar's Opera. A revival of the 200-year-old ballad opera has been playing to packed houses in London and has just been translated into German. Brecht interprets this play, set in London's underworld, as a critique of capitalism and gives it the title Gesindel, meaning scum or riffraff. 

The next day Aufricht reads the first pages of the manuscript and is hooked. He loves Brecht's bold approach, dry wit and the play's new epic style. He decides to stage it for his theatre's reopening. Brecht sets two conditions. First, Kurt Weill has to write the score, even though Aufricht is not keen on this atonal type of music. And secondly, he and Weill are to spend the summer on the French Riviera, along with their wives, at Aufricht's expense. In their retreat in Le Lavandou, the pair write the libretto and music for the Threepenny Opera, as Brecht now calls the piece. 

Crazy August days  

Rehearsals at the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm begin just four weeks before the premiere - and soon descend into chaos. Leading lady Carola Neher walks out. Brecht is constantly rewriting the script while exhausted actors sit and wait in the auditorium, sometimes until five in the morning. And Kurt Weill is furious because his girlfriend, Lotte Lenya, who plays 'Pirate Jenny', isn't even mentioned in the programme. Before the premiere Brecht says: ""This is the last time I'm ever coming to this theatre."" 

But Brecht is proved wrong. The Threepenny Opera premieres on 31 August 1928 and is an unexpected hit. At first the audience are a little unsure, but soon they are applauding enthusiastically and calling for encores of every song. The play that turns Brecht into a global star enjoys an uninterrupted run at the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm until it is banned by the Nazis in 1933. Brecht flees into exile. In 1954, six years after his return, he returns to the scene of his success when he takes over the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm and installs his own Berliner Ensemble.

",,,"Bauhaus fights for its independence
On the morning of 11 April 1933, police surround the Bauhaus School building in Birkbuschstraße. They have a search warrant. From then on, things happen very fast. Allegedly, they find communist propaganda in the building. The police rummage shelves and boxes, turning everything upside down, papers and books flying through the air. Students without any ID on them are taken to the police station. The building is locked and sealed. A police officer armed with a sub-machine gun takes up position at the entrance. The summer semester at the Bauhaus in Berlin has only just started. Is this the end of the road for the famous art and design college?

Berlin via Weimar and Dessau 

The memorial plaque in front of you commemorates the Berlin Bauhaus. In October 1932, this famous school of design, art and architecture left Dessau and moved to Germany's capital city. The Bauhaus, founded in 1919 in Weimar by the architect Walter Gropius, is renowned for its modernist furniture and architecture. In 1925, with Thuringia's conservative government cutting its funding, the Bauhaus School moves to Dessau. Yet even before the seizure of power by the National Socialists in 1933, Dessau's City Council has a right-wing majority. The city councillors fiercely condemn the Bauhaus as decadent, cosmopolitan and Bolshevist. In 1932, the Nazi Party in Dessau's city council forces through the closure of the Bauhaus.  

The teachers at the Bauhaus decide on Berlin as the new location. In the Lankwitz district, the Bauhaus rents a former telephone factory. But it still lacks all the equipment. They make a virtue out of necessity - and the first semester is declared as practical experience. The students clear the building, then set to work using their craft skills. They transform the factory into a college building. In early January 1933, the courses can start.  

The Nazi regime piles the pressure on the Bauhaus 

On 30 January 1933, the National Socialists under Hitler seize power in Germany. The spirit of the Bauhaus School is inspired by modernism and the Neues Bauen architectural movement - all anathema to the Nazis. The newspapers talk of the Bauhaus School as a poisonous communist cell. When police search the building in April 1933, they only find four copies of Die Weltbühne, a left-wing weekly. 

Architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, head of the Bauhaus, refuses to give in. He goes to see Alfred Rosenberg, Hitler's chief ideologue. Rosenberg is head of the Militant League for German Culture (KfdK), and fobs Mies van der Rohe off. But the Bauhaus director then even goes to talk to the Gestapo. Bauhaus students try to contact Joseph Goebbels, Hitler's Propaganda Minister. The result? The Bauhaus School can only be reopened if two of the teachers, Ludwig Hilberseimer and Wassily Kandinsky, are fired.  

There are new teachers ""firmly rooted in the ideas of National Socialism"" ready to take over their positions. But the Bauhaus management refuses. It would mean the end of free and independent teaching. To pre-empt the Nazi authorities from dissolving the college, Mies van der Rohe himself declares the Bauhaus closed. Many of its teachers and students leave Berlin.

Above the windows is a rusty brown beam with five iron hooks. It's cold. Deathly cold. This is the execution room, the Plötzensee death room. When the National Socialists spread their terror throughout Germany, 3,000 people die here because of their belief in freedom and a better world or at the hands of Nazi injustice.

It's a cold September night in 1943. Bomb strikes constantly light up the darkness. The beams of anti-aircraft spotlights dance across Berlin's night sky. The day before, air raids severely damaged parts of the prison. To prevent the prisoners from escaping, the regime decides to execute all those who have been sentenced to death. A black curtain divides the narrow execution room in two. The guillotine has been damaged by the bombing, so the executor's assistants hang the prisoners from wire loops attached to the eight hooks. Death is slow in coming. In this room, Hitler's murderers execute more than 250 people. 

The victims

The victims all have one thing in common: they defied the inhuman regime of the National Socialists. They are antifascists. They resisted in the hope of gaining freedom and fought to the bitter end to liberate Europe from fascism. They include communists and members of the Rote Kapelle, the Red Orchestra. But also Christians who resisted Hitler as members of the Kreisau Circle, and officers involved in the failed coup of 20 July 1944.  

The execution site where we are now standing is in the grounds of Plötzensee prison. The construction of the prison in the grounds of the Plötzensee estate in the Tegel Forest began in 1868. After 1933 it was increasingly used as a central execution site for political prisoners. By 1945, 2,891 prisoners had been put to death.  Plötzensee is still a correctional facility today.

In Berlin's ""Golden Twenties"", guests to the Tanzpalast Sevilla are delighted with its lavish details and opulence.

At Christmas 1927, the Tanzpalast Sevilla opens its doors at Oranienstraße 68. The dance hall is managed by the young Arthur Lefebre, born in 1899, whose father owns the building. To begin with, the Sevilla is really buzzing. To the music of the dance hall's own band, waiters, barmaids, barkeepers and pantry cooks all busily ensure that up to 400 guests enjoy a great evening out. But when the global economic crisis begins to bite, sales drop dramatically. The dance hall is also targeted a number of times by the Nazi's SA ""Brownshirts"".

In April 1932, Lefebre sees himself forced to close his business for the duration, hoping that the ""excesses of the SA troops and discrimination by the Nazi regime would only prove to be temporary"". When the situation shows no sign of improving, Lefebre first leases the dance hall. Then, from October 1935, with a staff of 22 Jewish employees, he tries to run it as a purely Jewish nightclub. To realise his plan, he requests permission from the Berlin Police Commissioner to offer a ""public dance hall only for Jewish guests"". Despite significantly declining sales, he manages to keep the dance hall alive until the November Pogroms in 1938. In February 1939, Lefebre has to liquidate his business. Under the Nazi's anti-Semitic laws, when he signs the paper he has to add Israel as his middle name.

",,,"Quenching a city’s thirst for electricity
The Klingenberg power plant was built in just two years and began production in May 1927. At the time, it was the largest, most modern power plant in Europe.  Built on the banks of the river Spree in the district of Rummelsburg, it was designed to satisfy Berlin's insatiable thirst for electricity.

 

Electropolis Berlin 

Berlin is dominated by the electrical industry. The global corporations Siemens and AEG both have their headquarters in the capital, along with huge production facilities. It is also home to other smaller producers of cables, light bulbs and electrical appliances. The city has an unquenchable thirst for electricity. One of the biggest consumers is the Reichsbahn, which is working on the electrification of the local rail network. By 1928 more than half of all private households are already connected to the grid. And then there are the street lamps, department stores, and neon signs - the city shows off its size and prosperity by lighting itself up at night.  

The growing demand for electricity is matched by pressure to increase the city's power supply. The creation of Greater Berlin in 1920 makes it possible to standardise and centralise the city's power supply. In 1923, BEWAG, the municipal electricity company, takes over responsibility for planning and operating new power plants. The city's small, unprofitable power plants are shut down and an ambitious new building programme is drawn up. At the heart of the plans is the Klingenberg power plant. 

A cathedral of electricity 

A huge building is constructed along both sides of Köpenicker Chaussee. Its façade consists of rows of dark red pillars reaching skywards - like an industrial cathedral. Eight chimneys and a 42-metre-high administrative block make the power plant a prominent landmark. A special canal is dug so that coal can be shipped in directly. The plant employs a brand-new technique - the coal is ground to a fine dust before being fed into the furnaces. Three huge steam turbines generate the electricity. People are particularly impressed by the fact that the plant automatically adjusts power production in line with fluctuations in demand.

But Klingenberg provides the city's residents with more than just power. At first BEWAG doesn't know what to do with the waste heat produced by the power station because there are no nearby residential areas that could use it for heating. So the water from the plant is fed into a specially designed outdoor swimming pool - a nice warm alternative to swimming in the Wannsee lido.

",,,"The freedom to swim
In 1998, brothers Jan and Tim Edler were sharing a studio with other artists on Museum Island. Every day, they looked out over the Spree Canal as they worked. Nothing ever happened on this long stretch of water - the stretch of river in the centre of Berlin was always deserted. The two brothers pondered how to change this and came up with an idea that is as simple as it is groundbreaking. 

20 years on, and the musings of the Edler brothers have become a national urban development project with funding from the German government and Berlin Senate. Flussbad Berlin is an inspired example of forward-looking urban development.  

So much more than an open-air swimming pool  

The Edlers struck a chord with their plan to transform the ""dead"" section of the Spree into a lively, publicly accessible bathing area. The promotional photo montage of people swimming up and down near the wide steps in front of Berlin Cathedral is captivating - simply stepping into the Spree and starting swimming must bring an incredible sense of freedom.  

But the people behind the idea are planning more than an open-air swimming pool in the historic heart of the city. In 2012 they organise themselves into a non-profit organisation and start work on plans to transform a section of canal near Fischerinsel. They want to create an ecological regeneration zone by planting the banks and installing a new jetty. There are also plans to create a 300-metre-long natural plant filter in the Friedrichsgracht area. This is needed because overflows in the sewage system can occasionally lead to contamination in the Kupfergraben, the area that is designated as the bathing area.  

All set for 2025  

Jan and Tim Edler's idea is already 20 years old, but it will still take time to turn their dream into reality. The project involves many complex challenges, decision-making processes and funding issues, but there's light at the end of the tunnel for Berlin's swimmers - the Flussbad is due to open by 2025 at the latest. Until then, there is an annual opportunity to officially swim by the Cathedral. Four years ago, the members of the Flussbad Berlin Association launched the Berlin Flussbad Trophy as a way of promoting their project.  

Flussbad supporter Johannes Riedner sums up why it is so important to turn their plans into reality. When he first swam in the Spree years ago, he says it was a truly unforgettable experience: ""It was like taking heroin, a sense of releasing the neurotransmitters in the brain - a feeling of pure happiness that I want to experience again.""

",,,"20 golden years in the ruins of a department store
It's hard to imagine, but on 13 February 1990 - right where you're standing - 20 members of the Tacheles artists' initiative climbed onto a fire engine ladder. They wanted to use the ladder to get into the ruins of the Friedrichstraßenpassage building. By doing so, they managed to stop the building being demolished and ended up creating a new free art centre in the reunified city.

When a policeman asks whether what they're allowed to do that, the squatters answer: ""Look, if we don't do this now, Deutsche Bank will come and take over the building."" So they carry on. The building has been cleared for demolition, so it's in urgent need of renovation. But that costs money. Unless the squatters legally occupy the building, it will be difficult to get a loan. So the artists have to find another way.  

A little commercialisation goes a long way 

They decide to open Café Zapata on the ground floor. It soon becomes a popular meeting place and the cash starts to flow in. Meanwhile, visitors to Berlin have discovered the ruin and its artworks. They come along to admire and photograph the art.  

The art scene is worried that the art could end up playing second fiddle to tourism. But in the months and years that follow, lots of German and international artists move to the centre to live and work. They include Dutch photographer Tim Roeloffs, Chilean theatre producer Paulo San Martin, German painter Thomas ""Tombo"" Sojka and director Jochen Sandig. But the creative project with its tolerant, liberal attitudes has its enemies.  

Attacks from the right - and from within 

Skinheads regularly turn up to trash the arts centre. Sometimes they come with baseball bats, sometimes with iron bars, but always with blind hatred. In June 1990 they attack with Molotov cocktails. As Thomas Sojka runs to put out the fire on the ground floor he is hit by a second Molotov cocktail. His clothes go up in flames and he's lucky to survive the attack. After six weeks in hospital he returns to the Tacheles centre to find life is going on as before, but the atmosphere is changing. Arguments break out regularly and in the end there's only one loser: the building itself. The artists vacate the premises in 2013.   

You can visit one of the last of the free art centres at Veteranenstraße 21. The 1,500-square-metre ACUD is home to a colourful mix of theatre, cinema, club, studio, gallery and small artists' workshops.

",,,"Faking freedom for a propaganda coup
1 August 1936. Cannons fire a welcome salute. In the Olympic Stadium, 100,000 people gaze up into the cloudy sky over Berlin. The massive Hindenburg zeppelin has just turned. Now, white doves of peace flutter across the stadium. A fanfare rings out. A symphony orchestra accompanied by a choir over 3000 strong launches into the Olympic Hymn, composed and conducted by Richard Strauss. No previous Olympic Games ever had such a powerful opening ceremony. For two weeks, the Nazi regime wants to present Berlin as a freedom-loving and tolerant city.

The Olympics as a symbol of power  

You are standing on the viewing platform of the Glockenturm - the Olympic Bell Tower - with its fantastic views across Berlin. This landmark tower looks out over the Olympic Stadium. Back then, people call this the ""Führer Tower"".  

In 1933, soon after the Nazi regime seizes power, they start planning for the Olympic Games. Their new Olympic complex - the Reichssportfeld - is to be unparalleled. The Nazi regime builds the largest stadium complex in Olympic history.  

Initially, Hitler is sceptical. The Olympic ideal of international peace contrasts sharply with his belief in the dominance of race and nation. But then he realises the enormous propaganda value of the Games - a unique chance to show Nazi Germany to the world as a peaceful and tolerant country.  

A dictator on hold 

In Berlin, anti-Semitic slogans and posters are removed. The bans in force on the Jewish population are relaxed. Taverns and dance bars could again enjoy some of their old freedoms. Guests could dance into the small hours to jazz and swing - previously condemned by the Nazis as ""nigger music"". Now the city seems chic and cosmopolitan. Functionaries describe the Olympic Games as an ""oasis of freedom"".  

But if so, this is an oasis with nothing for Jewish athletes. The world of sports and athletics has long been coordinated with Nazi policies. Nowhere does anti-Semitism become more quickly accepted than in sport: as early as March 1933, many sports clubs and associations are already expelling Jewish members. In 1936, multiple high jump title winner Gretel Bergmann is dropped from the German Olympic squad at the last moment. In contrast, top fencer Helene Mayer is kept in - as a ""token Jew"". Behind the scenes, the political terror continues. In the rows of the SA ""Brownshirts"", they sing: ""Once the Olympics are through, we'll beat up the Jew!"". While the Olympic Games are on, the Nazi regime also sets up the Sachsenhausen concentration camp.

The Olympic Grounds 1909-1936-2006, an exhibition by the German Historical Museum (DHM) on the ground floor of the Glockenturm, shows how sport was increasingly instrumentalised to prepare for war. 

The Olympic Games only last two weeks. Perfectly staged and organised, the Berlin Olympic Games today are synonymous with a dictatorship's power of persuasion. For the concluding ceremony, anti-aircraft spotlights are projected into the sky to create a hundred-metre-high dome of light designed by Albert Speer - and the crowds' shouts of Heil Hitler echo around the stadium. There would be no more token gestures to international understanding and the country's global standing.

",,,"Urban development as political posturing
In the 1950s, the Cold War also plays out in the urban planning and residential architecture in the divided city of Berlin. West Berlin is a tiny island surrounded by the Communist East Bloc. In the post-war years, with both East and West suffering from an acute lack of housing, East Germany's Soviet-supported SED regime lands a PR coup. It promises to turn East Berlin into a model future city - with modern and affordable housing for all.

Down Stalinallee in Friedrichshain, the building brigades are busy constructing apartment blocks for workers. But these are not just any apartment blocks. The monumental eight-storey buildings have a regal, palatial quality. Behind the neo-classical facades, the apartments are equipped with all mod cons - and have very affordable rents. This flagship project is not just about new residential space. As a beacon to demonstrate socialism's victory and advantages, it sends a clear signal to those living in West Berlin.

West Berlin needs to find a suitable reply, one also convincingly conveying the message of democracy. So in 1953, West Berlin launches an architectural competition. The winner is a design by architects Willy Kreuer and Gerhard Jobst for buildings in the Neues Bauen style, set generously in the cityscape with large greened spaces between them. An available site is quickly found - the old Hansaviertel district, completely destroyed in the war.

An exhibition of luminaries

Otto Bartning, President of the Association of German Architects (BDA) and a renowned architect in his own right, invites 53 colleagues from 13 countries to design the modern residential housing for the site. His call meets with a remarkable response. Architects from across the world, including such leading figures as Walter Gropius, Oscar Niemeyer and Alvar Aalto, present their designs for residential buildings in West Berlin.

In 1957, the international building exhibition Interbau '57 opens in West Berlin. But rather than looking at models or sketches, visitors can admire finished tower and apartment blocks for social housing.

Unlike the brick construction in East Berlin, these structures use steel-reinforced concrete. In place of facades in an ornate historicist style, linear designs reflect the function of the buildings. Moreover, since tower blocks can offer more space for apartments, they leave sufficient ground around them for greened areas.

The construction programme not only includes tower blocks, but also privately-owned detached houses and studio bungalows.

Small urban town versus bombastic boulevard

The Hansaviertel district is rather like a little town, with local shops, a cinema, a shopping centre and its own tube station. Set in a building with rows of floor-to-ceiling glass windows, the Hansabücherei is one of the first public libraries in Germany with open access shelving. With the Protestant Kaiser Friedrich Memorial Church and the Catholic St. Ansgar parish church, two new churches are also built, both in modern functional designs.

When Interbau '57 opens, it is a magnet for visitors keen to see the show apartments with Scandinavian furniture, Italian fabrics and the famous Bauhaus tubular steel armchairs. Quite aside from the architecture, the thrill of a cable car ride across the district is a real crowd-pleaser.

Ultimately, though, this is an architectural contest without a victor. For large-scale residential housing, neither the elaborate monumental blocks in a Soviet socialist realist style nor the modern Hansaviertel district tower blocks are a viable option. They are both simply too expensive. So the funding issue creates an unlikely convergence in the Cold War - in both East and West Germany, the new residential estates soon share some common features.
","Please remember:
When you visit the Gartenstadt Falkenberg estate, you are visiting people's homes. We would ask you to respect their privacy! Thank you!","In the Hansaviertel district, a 17-storey tower block called the Giraffe soars above all the other buildings. Here, architects Klaus Müller-Rehm and Gerhard Siegmann created apartments for single residence on each standard floor. Since half these studio apartments had a kitchenette and the other half an even smaller cupboard kitchen, the former were read as gendered female and the latter male. By 1957, such traditional roles were already outdated. Both styles of apartments attracted men and women equally.

",,,"Burrowing to freedom
When you visit the Berlin Wall Memorial, you can follow the metal markers that show the route of the former escape tunnel. This is the route taken by 57 men, women and children in the mid-1960s - twelve metres beneath your feet. They were heading to West Berlin, to freedom.  

Sand trickles into their eyes as they inch their way forward on their hands and knees.  They stop regularly, holding their breath. Above them is the border with its armed guards, vicious dogs, barbed wire and anti-tank barriers.

Building the tunnel is a massive undertaking for Peter Schulenburg from West Berlin and 34 of his friends. Digging under Berlin is difficult: They have to dispose of the excavated soil, pump out the groundwater, pump in fresh air, and prop up the walls. The tunnel builders live in constant fear of betrayal and detection. They use old German army telephones to communicate with each other. And, of course, everything has to be done secretly, furtively, quietly.  

But they get there in the end. 145 metres long, the tunnel runs from the cellar of an old bakery on the west side of Bernauer Straße to an unused toilet building in the courtyard of Strelitzer Straße 55 in East Berlin. On the nights of 3 and 4 October 1964, the tunnel is a ray of hope for 57 East German citizens. The escape organisers are armed with pistols - just in case. But they are unaware that the Stasi has got wind of the tunnel. 

On the second night, two men from the Stasi pretend to be part of the group who are nervously waiting to escape. They are so convincing that the escape organisers let them pass. The Stasi also enlist the help of a third ""escapee"" - East German border guard Egon Schultz. Shortly after midnight he receives the order to shoot, and there's a rapid exchange of fire in the tunnel. Schultz is killed by his own men.  

In an open letter to Egon Schultz's mother, the escape organisers describe what happened and claim that: ""The real killer is [...] the system, which deals with the mass exodus of its citizens not by eliminating the causes, but by erecting the WALL and ordering Germans to shoot other Germans"" 

The escape tunnel is later called Tunnel 57, after the 57 people who managed to escape. It is not only the longest and deepest escape tunnel in the GDR, but also the most successful in terms of the number of escapees.
",,"Tunnel 57 was the most expensive escape tunnel in the history of the GDR. It was partly financed by selling filming and image rights to the press. The Federal Ministry for All-German Affairs also contributed around 30,000 marks. It proved to be money well spent, as several CDU members from the East came to the West through the tunnel.

",,,"The day the shots ring out
Petrol pump attendant Bernhard Finke is refuelling a car when three shots ring out. Over the road, a man has shot Rudi Dutschke and is trying to get away. Finke is quick to react and calls on passers-by to help. They all give chase. Meanwhile, Rudi Dutschke has lost consciousness. It's 11 April 1968, Maundy Thursday.

The German Che Guevara 

In the Sixties, Rudi Dutschke is the face of the student protests. In 1966 he becomes spokesman for the Extra-Parliamentary Opposition (APO) protest movement. By 1967 he is a leading figure in the New Left and coins the phrase ""the long march through the institutions"" to describe his strategy of subverting society by infiltrating the Establishment. The movement's mission is to fight against a system that it believes is run by former Nazi officials. As a symbolic figure of protest, Dutschke is often compared to Che Guevara. He even names his first son after him: Hosea-Che.  

On 11 April 1968, Dutschke goes out to get some medicine for Hosea. A young man in a brown leather jacket asks him: ""Are you Rudi Dutschke?"". When he says yes, the man shoots him. The two bullets that strike Dutschke in the head also strike at the heart of the 1968 movement.  

Bild helped to pull the trigger 

The assassination attempt leads to the biggest riots ever seen on Germany's streets. They go down in history as the Easter demonstrations. The protest revolves around the Axel-Springer publishing house. Many blame the assassination attempt on the months of criticism of Dutschke spewed out by the Springer-owned newspaper Bild. Demonstrators attack the publisher's headquarters in Kochstraße chanting ""Springer - murderers"" and ""Bild helped to pull the trigger"". 

The far-right Deutsche National newspaper also wrote ""Stop Dutschke Now"" a few days before the assassination attempt. On 11 April 1968, this newspaper clipping was found lying on the passenger seat of the car belonging to Dutschke's would-be assassin, Josef Bachmann. Eyewitnesses report that Dutschke tried to grapple with Bachmann after the first shot, but two more bullets sent him crashing to the ground.  

""I'm sorry to learn that Dutschke is still alive."" 

Rudi Dutschke survives the attack but never fully recovers from his injuries. Bachmann is arrested on the same day, and his right-wing motivation is later revealed. In his statement he says: ""I'm sorry to learn that Dutschke is still alive. I should have bought a submachine gun. If I'd had the money, I could have ripped Dutschke apart."" He is sent to prison for seven years. 

But Dutschke forgives his attacker and they even exchange correspondence. Bachmann commits suicide in prison in 1970 and Dutschke sends flowers to be laid on his grave. Later he writes: ""The struggle for liberation has only just begun; unfortunately, Bachmann can no longer be a part of it."" 

The attack leaves Rudi Dutschke with long-term health problems. On Christmas Eve 1979 he suffers an epileptic fit in his bathtub and drowns.

Their efforts paid off, and now the Springer group has its headquarters on Rudi-Dutschke-Straße.

",,,"A pastor with a spirit of resistance
1 February 1933, Berlin. The crackling of static on the radio. The programme of the Funkstunde, the first German radio broadcaster, has just started. The speaker is the young pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer, just 26 years old. His voice rings out, definite and firm. Two days after Hitler's seizure of power, Bonhoeffer gives a radio address on the ""Younger Generation's Altered View of the Concept of Führer"". Bonhoeffer never once mentions Hitler's name, but his listeners know who he means. He says that a leader who becomes his followers' idol easily turns into a 'misleader'. These are courageous words. Suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, the broadcast is cut off.

Dietrich Bonhoeffer stands up against state injustice, opposes the principle of the Führer's word as above all written law, and speaks out against the persecution of the Jews. In the internal struggle in the Protestant Church, he is active in the opposition to Hitler's church party, the German Christians. Together with others including Martin Niemöller, he plays a crucial role in supporting the Confessing Church which opposes the Nazi regime's plan for a single pro-Nazi Protestant Reich Church.  

Pastoral care and resistance 

Dietrich Bonhoeffer has been working as a pastor in Berlin for several years. He preaches at the St. Mathew's Church in Tiergarten, and looks after a group preparing for confirmation at the Zionskirche church in the Mitte district. His work for the Zionskirche parish and his later activities in the resistance against the Nazis are honoured by an exhibition in the church and a sculpture. You can find the sculpture if you go to the left around the church past the entrance.  

The way to freedom  

In 1936, Bonhoeffer is forbidden to work as a teacher. This is soon followed by a ban on publishing and public speaking. He is also banned from staying in Berlin. Several times he has the chance to flee Germany. But he stays with his parish, even though he knows his efforts for freedom can cost him his life.  

Through Hans von Dohnanyi, a schoolfriend and later his brother-in-law, Dietrich Bonhoeffer is enlisted by the disaffected Abwehr military counter-intelligence unit headed by Admiral Canaris. There, he comes into contact with groups in the German military resistance. He cultivates contacts to the Kreisau Circle of dissidents around Helmuth von Moltke. In 1941 and 1942, Bonhoeffer travels to Norway, Sweden and Switzerland as a courier for the resistance. As a representative of the resistance against Hitler, his task is to contact the Allies abroad. In 1943, Bonhoeffer is entangled in an attempt to assassinate Hitler by the group around Admiral Canaris.  

The Gestapo uncover the conspiracy, arresting Bonhoeffer and his brother-in-law Hans von Dohnanyi for sedition and subversion of the war effort. 

In prison, Bonhoeffer writes many poems, including Stations on the Way to Freedom. Freedom means daring to do what is right, and taking up responsibility - and it transcends the private sphere. Bonhoeffer also calls for direct political action since ""mere waiting and looking on is not Christian behaviour"". 

In 1944, since he is classified as a ""personal prisoner of Hitler"", Bonhoeffer is interrogated at the Gestapo headquarters in Prinz-Albrecht-Straße. He is sent to Buchenwald and then to Flossenbürg concentration camp. Shortly before the end of the war, he is summarily court-martialled and sentenced to death. The sentence is carried out on the morning of 9 April 1945. As a final humiliation, he and the other condemned prisoners have to walk out naked to the gallows.

",,,"Wolf Biermann finds freedom within his own four walls
Chausseestraße 131, 1968. Wolf Biermann sings and yells into the microphone: ""I've had enough!"" The songwriter directs his typically angry, sarcastic lyrics at opportunists, cowards and bureaucrats. Behind him, a tape recorder is running. This is Biermann's home, but it is also his recording studio and a rare bastion of true freedom in a world of state socialism.

In the late 1960s, Biermann finds himself under enormous pressure from the East German regime. The state has effectively banned the lyricist, singer and composer of political songs from working. Biermann is not allowed to perform or publish his songs. His lyrics are too accurate, his criticisms too pointed, his satire too caustic and creative. The regime decides to muzzle him.  

Barred from professional recording studios, he starts recording his first album at home. He smuggles in a top-quality Sennheiser microphone, which picks up the sound of trams and Trabants driving by. This would normally be a musician's nightmare, but here it acts as a perfect time capsule. The street sounds in the background are a charming reminder of how, in the GDR, criticism can only be articulated behind closed doors.  

Biermann's LP Chausseestraße 131 is eventually released in West Germany. Later on, the singer comments: ""The title should have been: This particular Bierman is banned in the East, (...) but it's not like he's actually in hiding, he has a name and address in Berlin, easy to find for both friend and foe"". 

For many years, his apartment was as a meeting place for the intellectual opposition, and attracted Western celebrities such as Udo Lindenberg, Heinrich Böll, Rudi Dutschke and Joan Baez. But Biermann's closest confidant and most regular visitor was Robert Havemann. During the Third Reich, Havemann worked for Communist International's intelligence service and was a founding member of the European Union - not today's organisation, but a Berlin-based antifascist resistance group. He was arrested and sentenced to death in 1943 but was never actually executed.  

In the GDR, Havemann quickly became a leading critic of the regime and a friend and mentor to Wolf Biermann. But their time together in Chausseestraße came to an abrupt end. After his concert in Cologne on 13 November 1976, the GDR expelled the songwriter and banned him from returning to East Berlin. At a stroke, Biermann had lost his friend Havemann and his legendary home.
",,"Opponents of the East German regime speak freely when they visit Biermann's home - yet they all know that the Stasi have bugged the apartment. Later, Biermann describes Chausseestraße 131 as a ""grubby Stasi-ridden hole"" (2) and in his Stasi Ballad he mocks the state spies who have to listen to his foul language and sexual escapades.

In early September 1928, the Berlin police hold their summer festival in the Luna Park. They also offer a special competition, open to everyone keen on testing their own detective skills. At the entrance, visitors are given a flyer describing three wanted men. The task is to find these three men in the festival crowds - and win a top prize of a stately 1000 Marks.

To enter the Luna Park, you first pass the monumental entrance gate on Kurfürstendamm boulevard. Then you follow a narrow colonnade down towards the main restaurant - the Terraces at Halensee. From the tower at the Terraces, you have a panoramic view of the amusement park's attractions.

Spoilt for choice

While visitors try to spot the three wanted men, they can enjoy a wide range of rides and amusements - from bumper cars to little boats on a water slide into Halensee lake, or dancing to jazz music. On the Devil's Wheel, a spinning circular platform, the riders slide off as its speed gradually increases, or you can wobble your way down the Shimmy Staircase, divided into two offset tiers of shaking stairs. Visitors can also enjoy concerts, eat in the Terraces restaurant or carouse to their heart's content in the Bavarian village. The highlight of the evening's entertainment is a firework display.

An amusement park needs a varied programme to regularly draw the crowds. Every year, the Luna Park management offer new, sensational attractions. In summer 1924, for instance, the amusement park launches a prize draw - with top prizes including cars and even a house in the country. In 1926, the Luna Park boasts an escalator - one of the first in Berlin. That same summer, the amusement park also hosts a boxing match won by Max Schmeling, then unknown but later world heavyweight champion. At Luna Park, Schmeling needs just three minutes to win by a knock-out. In 1927, the big attraction is a wave pool. The Luna Pool is Berlin's first fun and wave pool, but also a venue for serious competitions. In summer 1928, the wooden roller-coaster is given its most modern setting - a skyscraper city.

""Who are these three men?""

As newspapers report, the police summer festival attracts thousands of visitors - though crowds of that size are not an exception at the Luna Park. In warm summer weather and with their special events, the amusement park often draws crowds of 50,000 to 60,000. The main restaurant can serve over 7,000 guests at any one time. With such teeming crowds and a wealth of attractions, no one manages to identify all three of the wanted men. But at least one visitor goes away as a happy second place winner. The prize is awarded in the presence of the Wilhelm Abegg, State Secretary of the Interior, and Bernhard Weiß, Berlin's deputy Chief Constable.

In autumn 1933, the Luna Park closes its gates for the last time. Today, the amusement park on Halensee lake has disappeared without trace - and not solely due to poor business decisions. Luna Park certainly suffered after the global economic crisis, but it was also on a site in the way of the Nazi regime's bombastic urban masterplan. If you visit Halensee today, you can see the result of that plan from the Trabener Steg - thousands of cars roaring past where once thousands celebrated.
",,"Like all other amusement parks, the Luna Park was closed in the First World War. As the local Berliner Tagblatt newspaper noted, it was put to a ""serious use in the war years"". Some buildings housed wounded soldiers, while the Terraces kitchens produced cans of tinned food for the German troops.

"Flatowallee 16, 14055 Berlin",52.510151,13.243716,History,1,FALSE,The Corbusier House,"Le Corbusier wants to lead Berlin into the modern age. But his visionary residential complex remains one of a kind
",,,"Life in a “machine for living”
Charles Edouard Jeanneret-Gris, better known as Le Corbusier, thought it would all turn out very differently. The original plan was for Le Corbusier to build a flagship residential unit here on the edge of Grunewald - a Berlin version of his ""unité d'habitation"". It would be a first for Berlin, a high-rise building with a truly modern approach to living. But the building ends up being a shadow of its original design.

At first glance, the new Cubist building bears similarities to other designs by the famous Swiss architect, who was responsible for the French contribution to the Interbau International Building Exhibition. But by the time the topping-out ceremony is held in the summer of 1958, it's clear that many of Corbusier's architectural principles have fallen by the wayside. There's no roof garden with an open-air theatre. The room height has soared to 2.65 metres, and there's no sign of his usual long, horizontal windows. German building regulations and the need to save money have taken their toll.  

Tenement or architectural landmark?  

What remains of Corbusier's original ideas are his favoured concrete columns and open-plan layouts. Even before the building is finished, the local press are calling it ""Berlin's largest tenement building at Interbau"". West Berlin struggles to come to terms with the colossus, which is due to contain 500 apartments. Yet the city is proud to be working with such an eminent architect, whose building is meant to be a response to the Socialist Classicism that is rampant in East Berlin. Architecture is just another front in the battle between the two political ideologies.  

But that's of little concern to the first occupants of the 17-storey block. They're just happy to enjoy the amenities - panoramic views, a row of shops on the ground floor with a post office, hairdresser, doctors' surgeries and a grocery store that even delivers to their door. 

Idea or ideology?  

Le Corbusier is particularly keen to lighten the burden on housewives: ""Freed from the heavy burden of housework and childcare, families will lead happy lives in my building. There will be no quarrels between neighbours and no divorces."" However, he is not a proponent of women's rights. He still believes a woman's place is in the home, and his aim is solely to relieve them of some of their household chores.   

Corbusier is clear that his huge, angular buildings are not designed to be creative refuges for the individual. He is seeking solutions for the masses. That's why he invented the Modulor, a standard scale for a building's proportions. It is based on an ideal body height of 1.83 metres and a navel height of 1.13 metres. He used this to calculate the ceiling heights for this building - 2.26 metres.  

The fact that the basic principles of his ""machines for living"" work on paper but not in practice is of little interest to Le Corbusier. The building's endless corridors make life more difficult, and there are no cellars. And once the grocery store moves out there's no need for the celebrated food hatches in each apartment. At the end of the day, urban living can't be designed like a factory.

",,,"Berlin’s oldest cinema
""Normal or mirror room?"" This question is asked hundreds of times a day at the box office at Hohenstaufen-Lichtspiele cinema, today's Moviemento. It's a question that matters, because tickets for the mirror room are cheaper, and we're on the border between Kreuzberg and Neukölln, two working-class districts where people have to watch the pennies.

The cinema's particular layout on the first floor of a corner building and its location in a working-class neighbourhood gave the owners an idea. Filmgoers can choose between two screening rooms. If you opt for the larger auditorium, you watch the film in the normal way at regular admission prices. But if you want to save a little cash you can opt for the mirror room, which is built at an angle to the main auditorium and located behind the screen. The screen itself is made of translucent silk batiste, so the audience in the mirror room can also watch the film, but the images are back to front.  

Mirror technology with a catch 

With the advent of the talkies around 1930, it didn't matter too much whether the audience saw the images the right way round or back to front. But silent movies had captions to explain the plot and reading them the wrong way round was a little more challenging! The answer was to install a mirror to turn the images and text back the right way. So if you don't mind the film being a little paler, the sound a little quieter and the actors acting back to front, you can save your hard-earned dough by buying a ticket for the mirror room. 

Neighbourhood cinemas 

Today's Moviemento is the oldest cinema still in existence in Berlin. Films have been shown here since 1907. In the 1920s, most modern cinemas were specifically designed to show the latest films after lavish premieres. But other cinemas opened all over the city in former shops and apartments, in dance halls and ballrooms, in courtyards and side buildings - basically in spaces that weren't designed to be cinemas. It meant that some of them had to get creative with mirrors - like today's Moviemento.  

These cinemas usually attracted audiences from the immediate neighbourhood. Admission was cheap, the audience didn't have to travel far, and the films were not necessarily the latest releases. The audience tended to take a few more liberties than they do today, often eating, drinking and smoking during the film and passing loud comments about what was happening on the screen. Many of them also used the neighbourhood cinemas as places to keep warm in winter or to escape from their cramped homes, and young couples had somewhere to cuddle under cover of darkness. The film itself - whether back to front or not - was not necessarily the main attraction. 
",,"The Moviemento has had many names over the years: Vitascope, Odeon, Hohenstaufen-Lichtspiele, Taki and Tali. It may be an urban myth, but it's often claimed that the slang word for cinema, ""Kintopp"", originated here, after Alfred Topp, one of the cinema's early operators. One thing we do know is that the filmmaker Tom Tykwer worked at the cinema in the 1980s and was responsible for selecting the programme.

",,,"Nazi Forced Labour Documentation Centre
The apple tree hangs temptingly over the barbed wire fence that separates the forced labour camp from the neighbouring garden. Ugo Brilli can't resist one of the dark red apples. He reaches out but it's too high up. One of the guards immediately fires a warning shot. Brilli, an Italian internee, never goes near the apples again.

You're standing in front of one of the 13 barracks that make up the former forced labour camp in Schöneweide. This camp complex is the only one in Berlin to have been preserved largely intact.

In plain sight

In 1943, forced labourers are a common sight. Up to 11 million people are being forced to work in Germany and its occupied territories. Many of them are in Berlin. The camp in Schöneweide, one of around 3,000 such camps in Berlin, is located in the middle of a residential area. Local residents can look over at the camp while they eat their Sunday breakfast.

The first of over 2,000 forced labourers arrives in Schöneweide in mid-1944. They work on building sites, in munitions factories, for the German Railway, or they're put to work building anti-aircraft installations or clearing rubble. Without forced labour, the German economy would collapse. The camp in Schöneweide quickly fills up, mainly with deported civilians from Western and Eastern Europe and female prisoners from a satellite of the Sachsenhausen concentration camp. There are also a few Italian soldiers.

Cigarettes can save lives

The Italians arrive in Schöneweide at the end of November 1944. Until recently they were military allies. But when Italy switches sides, they become enemies whose labour is to be exploited.

Ugo Brilli is one of them. On 18 November 1944, he is issued with a housing card. He will live in building 3, room 7 until the end of the war. At first Brilli works for Siemens, clearing rubble. The job is physically exhausting, and he gets thinner by the day. Then he uses cigarettes to buy himself a kitchen job in the camp. It proves to be his salvation - his weight has dropped to 48 kilos.

A life in limbo

Apart from going to work, the forced labourers rarely leave the camp. They are not forbidden to leave, but they are not allowed to take any part in public life. So they can't go to the cinema or play sport. Public transport is off limits. This restricted freedom of movement means that many inmates are killed in air raids because they are not allowed to use public air raid shelters.

Brilli survives. On 23 April 1945, the Red Army liberates the forced labour camp. He has a long journey home, arriving in northern Italy in September 1945. Decades later he recounts his experiences of daily life in the camp. You'll hear his story as part of the audio guide that accompanies your tour of the camp.

",,,"Hollywood in Weißensee
It's September 1919, barely a year after the end of the First World War. Electricity and building materials are scarce. Despite this, Decla, a film production company, is building a film set in Weißensee and invites the press to visit the shoot. Decla even covers the cost of the journalists' taxis and provides them with sandwiches. They're shooting a crowd scene - a procession through medieval Florence.

The journalists thank the production company for its generosity by writing effusive articles praising the elaborate set and professional film work. The producer of the epic film The Plague in Florence is Erich Pommer. The plot is unrestrainedly theatrical, and the film turns out to be a box office flop. But just a few months later, Pommer produces a film that is destined to become a classic of silent cinema: The Cabinet of Dr Caligari. 

Shooting silent movies in Weißensee 

In the 1920s Weißensee is known as Little Hollywood. Dozens of silent movies are shot at the many major film studios that set up shop here between 1913 and 1928. They include detective films, historical dramas - and the expressionist classic about the scary Doctor Caligari. The film studios are located on Franz-Joseph-Straße, today's Liebermannstraße. A small square in Weißensee now bears the name Caligariplatz in memory of the many films that were made there. 

Ten years after the shooting of The Plague in Florence, a new cinema opens on Caligariplatz. The exterior of the Delphi cinema is fairly plain - only a pyramid-shaped neon sign with the slanting Delphi lettering adorns the smooth plaster of its almost windowless façade. The Delphi is a large cinema. The auditorium has seating for 900 people in the stalls and circle, and the screen is framed by three impressive stucco arches.  

The talkies take over 

When the Delphi opens in Weißensee, the silent movie era is already coming to an end. In reality, the films were never truly silent. Before sound films were invented, the screenings were accompanied by orchestras, pianists or mechanical musical instruments. Sometimes a narrator provided a running commentary on the plot. The talkies made a breakthrough in Germany in 1930 with the release of two classic early sound films Die drei von der Tankstelle and Der blaue Engel. However, these new films weren't shot in Weißensee, but at the film studios in Babelsberg. The Delphi also has to adapt to the new era and start showing films with sound.  

Unlike many cinemas in Berlin, the Delphi survives the war largely unscathed. But it later falls into disrepair and closes in 1959.Over the years, its foyer is used as a vegetable store, a stamp shop and a laundry. Since 2013, the listed building has served as a venue for independent cultural events - and as a location for film and TV. In the series Babylon Berlin it provides the backdrop for the dance scenes at Moka Efti.  
",,"If you want to watch a film in Weißensee today, you can go to the Toni cinema on Antonplatz, which was owned by to the Decla film production company in the early 1920s. Otherwise there is the Brotfabrik cinema on Caligariplatz. Artists from this cultural centre were behind the idea of giving the square this new name.

Hot food day and night, two dance bands and a billiard hall - a winning line-up drawing the crowds to Café Moritzplatz. The square is a busy intersection - packed with a stream of horse-drawn carriages and omnibuses carrying white-collar and blue-collar workers, travellers from across the world and those seeking entertainment in the German capital.

Shortly before the First World War, Café Moritzplatz opens in Oranienstraße 53/54. The building, designed by Alfred Messel, initially houses the first branch of Georg Wertheim's department store in Berlin. But despite having an annex built, the premises for the store are soon too small. Wertheim moves to a new Moritzplatz building - today the site of the Princess Gardens. The old department store in Oranienstraße is turned into a spacious coffee house. Café Moritzplatz can host over 1200 guests - and has no less than two dance bands to choose from. Its own advertising labels proudly bear the claim of being the largest Concert Café in the south of Berlin.

In those days, these adhesive advertising labels to market products or promote causes were known as poster stamps. They could easily be glued onto parcels or put up in urban space - in a similar way to flyposting for clubs and bars today. The posh-looking man with a top hat and monocle decorating the café's advertising label is highly reminiscent of the Manoli Dandy, an iconic figure advertising a leading Berlin brand of cigarettes in the 1920s.

Manoli advertises with large illuminated signs across Berlin set high up on corner houses, the signs casting their light down the streets. One of these round advertising signs was also set directly on a corner building at Moritzplatz.

The café boasting hot foot day and night and a large billiard hall is owned by Richard Korant, who also runs a distillery and wine shop in nearby Prinzenstraße 82/84.

In the 1920s, Café Moritzplatz became the Triumph-Palast. Later, the premises were used by a silk yarn factory.
In the Second World War, the building was severely damaged in an air raid. In 1957, the ruins were demolished. The new Wertheim department store at Moritzplatz was also destroyed in the Second World War.

",,,"Barricades and evacuations
It stinks of smoke. The sound of shattering glass and shouted orders is drowned out by the hiss of water cannons and the clatter of stones as they hail down onto the street. It feels more like a scene from a civil war than a planned eviction. But the police are determined to take back the street - at any cost.

Long live Mainzer Straße! That's the message on the orange container in the squatters' barricades.

Since the spring of 1990, this has been the home of East and West Berliners alike, a diverse group of antifascists, non-conformists, punks, gays and artists. But they are all united by their desire for space and freedom, whether it's room for new countercultures or empty places to live. There is no shortage of opportunities, because East Berlin is still a power vacuum. The West German police don't feel they are responsible for it, and East Germany's Volkspolizei no longer have an incentive to get their fingers burned. As far as the police are concerned, East Berlin doesn't exist.  The fall of the Wall also means that large numbers of old buildings are standing empty, and it's unclear who owns them. 200 are taken over by squatters. 

The occupation of the first ten houses in Mainzer Straße leads to the emergence of an alternative community. There are art studios, gay bars, theatres, cheap food at the ""Volxküche"" (people's kitchen), playgrounds and junk shops. Then there's the gay house, the lesbian and women's house, and lots of mixed apartment buildings. But there are people who hate these free-wheeling lifestyles. The squatters face regular attacks from neo-fascists. 

The ""Berlin Line"" policy reaches the East  

As of 24 July 1990, the ""Berlin Line"" policy also applies in the East, meaning that new squats can be cleared within 24 hours. Although the Mainzer Straße squats are all old buildings, on 12 November it becomes clear that the Senate is not prepared to make an exception. An armoured car is sent in to flatten the squatters' blockades, the police spray tear gas, and a water cannon is turned on the buildings. The squatters respond with a hail of stones, forcing the police to retreat. The next day is filled with demonstrations against police brutality. The street plenum, which is jointly responsible for Mainzer Straße, repeatedly announces its willingness to negotiate and promises the immediate dismantling of the barricades. But all attempts to reach someone in the Senate are doomed to failure.  

14 November 1990, 3.45 am - it all kicks off  

A cellar is in flames. Pure coincidence? Or is it a deliberate attack, meaning some of the barricades have to be moved to make way for the fire brigade? Whatever the cause, once the fire brigade has left the scene, the police get heavy handed. At 6am they begin a major offensive involving 3,000 policemen, 10 water cannons and several armoured cars. They are met with Molotov cocktails and stones being hurled from the house roofs. The riot police attempt to take control of the roofs by shooting rubber bullets and gas grenades from helicopters. It's a miracle that no-one falls off. But the people of Mainzer Straße realise the only way to break the spiralling violence is to clear out. Later, Mayor Walter Momper justifies the police crackdown by saying the squatters were ""prepared to kill"". But he fails to mention the massive police brutality.
",Freely accessible,"With the ""Volxsküche"" the squatters open a cheap street kitchen, which is also used by other residents. No wonder: for three Deutschmarks they can buy a freshly cooked hot meal, bought directly from the producers or local agricultural cooperatives.

On 9 September 1948, Ernst Reuter - later West Berlin's first Governing Mayor - makes his powerful appeal to the western powers: ""People of the world, people in America, England, France and Italy! Look upon this city and know you cannot, you must not, forsake us."" And his appeal is heard.

You are now on the Platz der Republik, the square in front of the Reichstag Parliament building. The square covers around 40,000 square metres, an area equivalent to roughly six to seven football pitches. On 9 September 1948, Berlin residents crowd into this space to hear speakers in front of the Reichstag ruins. They have some eventful days behind them. Three days before, the city assembly in the Rotes Rathaus in the eastern sector is the scene of harassment and unrest. Members of the Socialist Unity Party, which has strong links to Moscow, violently disturb the session, but the East Berlin police do not intervene.  

Moreover, in June the Soviet forces already seal off land and water access to the sectors of Berlin under the Western Allies. The blockade hangs like a dark shadow over the divided city. At that time, Ernst Reuter is the elected Lord Mayor of Berlin, but the Soviets refuse to recognise his position. He knows his city is facing a crucial test - and his appeal must make itself heard. Reuter is a man of the people with a very chequered biography. But as he moves forward to the rostrum his past is unimportant, whether as a former Communist, a left-wing social democrat, a concentration camp inmate or an émigré under the Nazi regime. He knows exactly what is at stake - the freedom of the 300,000 people gathered to hear him, and the future of all those threatened by Communism.  

From the rostrum to the entire world  

His voice echoes over the square: ""Today is the day when the people of Berlin raises its voice. Today, the people of Berlin are calling to the entire world."" Enthralled, his audience follow his speech closely as he talks of the hungry Russian bear not just ready to swallow up Berlin, but all of Germany. Yet rather than seeking to fuel people's fears, Reuter wants to break out of the victim role. Each of his words is a challenge to the threat from the East: ""We cannot be traded, we cannot be bartered away, and we can also not be sold."" For him, Berlin in ruins is ""a bulwark, an outpost of freedom"".  

Rhetoric against repression   

His appeal to the determination of Berlin residents in the western sectors is enthusiastically received, with the huge square erupting into applause. Even well beyond Berlin and Germany's borders, Reuter's appeal is heard. The nations he calls on are ready and willing to support the divided city. Finally, with the Allied expansion of the airlift, the Soviet blockade is breached and defeated.

It will be broadcasting it live - giving hope to those citizens who were not allowed to stand where you are now, in front of the Reichstag building.

But at least music transcends borders. And the stars know it. David Bowie lived in Berlin for a few years, and he wants it to be a concert for the whole city. He headlines the show on the first evening, greeting his fans on the other side of the Wall in a loud, clear voice, saying in German: ""And we send our best wishes to all our friends who are on the other side of the Wall"". 

The lure of freedom  

Of course, the organisers are well aware of the show's impact on young East Berliners. They later deny that some speakers were deliberately turned towards the border, but the wind still carries the music over the Wall. The East Germans hear its siren call. At first, a few fans dribble towards the Brandenburg Gate. Then on Whit Monday, the third day, Genesis take to the stage and several thousand East German fans rush to the border.

",,,"A dialogue between the world’s cultures
In the 15th century, if you were to stand on this very spot where the Berlin Palace is now being built, you would have seen towers instead of cranes and heard the sound of horse-drawn carriages instead of pneumatic drills. It was the residence of the feudal nobility, then the Prussian kings, and later the imperial court. After being badly damaged during the Second World War, the palace was blown up in 1950 on the orders of the East German government and replaced by the Palast der Republik. In the end this palace was also demolished between 2006 and 2008 because of the asbestos used in its construction.

One man in particular is fascinated by the history of the palace - the entrepreneur Wilhelm von Boddien. Ever since Germany's reunification, this lover of fine architecture has been hoping the magnificent building will be restored to life. In 1992 he sets up a foundation to lobby for its reconstruction and pays for a full-size canvas mock-up of the palace in its original location. 

Understanding the world as a whole  

This proves to be controversial, and some critics claim the building embodies a ""national neurosis"". However, in 2002, a large majority in the German Bundestag approves the reconstruction of the palace as a seat for the Humboldt Forum, which will provide a ""showcase for the cultures of the world"". Wilhelm von Boddien's foundation continues to collect donations for the reconstruction of the building's historic facade, and by 2018 has amassed around 80 million euros. 

The palace is to be more than just a tourist attraction. The new building with the baroque façade will house the Humboldt Forum - a centre for art, culture, science and education. It is due to open in late 2019, 30 years after the fall of the Wall. Admission will be free of charge.  

""Named after the Humboldt brothers, the Humboldt Forum aims to present the challenges and opportunities faced by the whole world through a series of fascinating exhibitions, research projects, talks and other events. This is the idea behind the Humboldt Forum"", writes Horst Bredekamp, Professor of Art History and, until June 2018, one of the founding directors of the Humboldt Forum. 

Squaring up to controversy 

What can you expect when you visit the Forum? The Humboldt Forum is very aware of the discussion about the provenance of museum exhibits and Germany's colonial past. Where did the exhibits come from? Were they donated? Were they obtained legally? Or were they effectively stolen? With the relocation of the non-European collections from the Dahlem museum to their new home in central Berlin, the spotlight will not only be turned on the beauty of the exhibits, but also on their origins.

Today's lunch is vegan beetroot and walnut risotto. If you're a vegetarian you can add a sprinkle of parmesan. And on request you can add a little Serrano ham. These three lines on the menu tell you everything you need to know about Südblock - it has something to suit every taste and every lifestyle.

 The urban planners call the buildings on the south side of Kottbusser Tor ""Südblock"" - south block. For some, the name is synonymous with a dodgy neighbourhood, a dangerous area. When Tülin Duman, Dennis Kuhlow and Richard Stein saved this one-storey building from being turned into a gambling den, born-and bred Kreuzbergers chose this particular name. At the opening on 4 December 2010, Stein commented to a reporter from queer magazine Siegessäule: ""We've (...) all lived here a long time and don't believe it's a social 'non-place' or in any way dodgy."" 

When you sit on the red plastic chairs outside Südblock, you find yourself sitting in what is probably Berlin's most urban beer garden. Behind you are the Kreuzberg apartment blocks, in front the busy Kottbusser Tor traffic junction. It doesn't get more Kreuzberg than that. But a special kind of neighbourhood has grown up in this urban jungle over recent years. Südblock is a place for everyone.  

Gays, lesbians, Turks 

A café, a stage and sometimes a social centre - Südblock offers a diverse programme. When it was being renovated and the imitation terracotta and suspended ceilings being torn out, friends and neighbours all turned up to help. The LGBTQ community has been involved from the start, but it's also popular with local Turkish residents. A café by day and a party venue by night, it still makes sure it doesn't disturb the neighbours. When the glass windows of the ""aquarium"" next to Südblock start to steam up on the inside, the beer garden is strictly off limits so that the neighbours can get their sleep.  

Problems, queers and parties 

Südblock also addresses social - and cosmetic - problems in Kreuzberg. The Hartzer Roller association offers advice on welfare issues every Tuesday from 1pm, while the Salon Saalam offers haircuts and fortune-telling every second Monday. It also hosts regular events and discussions on local issues. And of course it wouldn't be Kreuzberg without all kinds of party events, such as the Flittchenbar, Dance-Karaoke and Queer Arabeske. Not to mention serving breakfast, lunch and cake all day long. For the people of Kreuzberg, Südblock is a home from home, a place where they can simply be themselves.

",,,"Berlin’s Radio Tower
Welcome to the opening of the third ""Great German Radio Exhibition""! On 3 September 1926, the late summer sun is shining brightly on the fairs and exhibition grounds along Berlin's Kaiserdamm boulevard. The guests gathered for the opening admire the festive decorations in the exhibition hall. The Berlin Radio Orchestra launches into Beethoven's Leonore Overture No. 3. As the final notes fade away, radio announcer Alfred Braun reads an inauguration poem. Then Gustav Böß, Mayor of Berlin, officially declares the new Radio Tower open to the public.

A mini-Eiffel Tower

The Radio Tower rises into sky behind the ceremony, a silent guest of honour, its iron braces decorated with garlands of flowers. Although inspired by the Eiffel Tower in Paris, Berlin's Radio Tower looks more linear and less elaborate - and, as a result, is lighter and much cheaper to construct. The German capital's new iconic landmark is around 150 metres high, just half the height of the Eiffel Tower, and stands as a symbol of global communication and technical progress. In his Welcome Address, Dr. Alfred Schick, director of fairs and exhibitions, enthuses: ""As a new Victory Column in the west of the city, the Radio Tower proclaims the human mind's peaceful victory over time and space."" 

From A for anode to W for wave meter

From the foot of the Radio Tower, visitors stream towards the large exhibition hall known as the Haus der Funkindustrie (House of the Wireless Industry). So, let's take a look at the attractions for ourselves. For ten days, 250 exhibiters at the trade fair are showing the latest innovations in wireless transmission technologies. The Berlin companies of Siemens, AEG and Telefunken are the market leaders - and they assert their right to place their exhibition areas and displays in the centre of the hall. Around them, competitors from local heroes, like the Nora-Radio company from Charlottenburg, to national players, such as SABA from the Black Forest, show off radio frequency coils, condensers and headphones. Does that lush sound seem familiar? Then it must be an Acuston speaker! Don't miss a visit to the gallery - there, in one of the soundproofed demonstration booths, you can experience a radio broadcaster in action. The Funkstunde, Germany's first radio broadcaster, is broadcasting live from the fair and exhibition grounds.

Radio is uncharted territory

The years of radio's enthusiastic youth, between 1923 and 1933, are a time of innovation and experiments. Early radio construction and listening is, first and foremost, driven by amateurs, geeks and boffins. In the early days, technical know-how is needed to set cables and antenna for interference-free reception. But by 1928 at the latest, German companies are already looking to produce radios in series. The young republican democracy of Germany, founded in 1919, promises to put a radio in every home so all its citizens can participate in cultural life. After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, the regime instrumentalise the Great German Radio Exhibition as a political show. Aware of the power of wireless as a propaganda channel, the Nazi regime prioritises production of the affordable Volksempfänger (""people's receiver""). Then, at the latest, the world of radio loses its innocence.

The Radio Tower falls silent

After the Second World War, the idea of a major fair for radio is revitalised. From 1971, Berlin hosts the IFA (Internationale Funkausstellung), attracting electronics experts and fans from all over the world. Just as in the 1920s, the event is held in the exhibition hall directly next to the Funkturm - Berlin's Radio Tower. There is, though, one major difference - with modern transmitters so powerful, the Radio Tower has long fallen silent. But the Radio Tower restaurant and viewing platform remain just as popular as ever.

",,,"Parade ground of the Weimar Republic
In 1918, on the Sunday before Christmas, the imperial capital witnesses one of the ""most moving demonstrations"" in its history. The Imperial Association of War Veterans and War Wounded is staging a protest march from the Lustgarten park to the War Ministry in Wilhelmstraße. 10,000 war veterans make their way along Unter den Linden - the blind, the crippled and the wheelchair-bound all remind the people of Berlin of the terrible consequences of the lost war. They carry placards asking: ""Is this the thanks we get from the Fatherland?"" 

""Long live the Republic - No more war!"" 

During the 1918 revolution, the former parade ground of the Hohenzollern monarchy becomes a central rallying point for the young republic. In the early 1920s, hundreds of thousands of people gather here to demonstrate against militarism and tyranny. This is the precise spot where emperors would accept their oaths of allegiance from young recruits. During World War I, this is where captured enemy cannons were displayed and where German weapons were blessed. On 1 August 1921, 200,000 people are mobilised to take part in an anti-war demonstration.  

Democrats and pacifists protest peacefully, but opponents of the Weimar Republic resort to violence. Just three weeks after this peace demonstration, centrist politician Matthias Erzberger is killed by right-wing terrorists. His memorial service in the Lustgarten on 31 August 1921 is attended by 500,000 Berliners, turning it into a rejection of violence and a demonstration of support for the Republic. 

""Berlin remains red!"" 

The right to protest is enshrined in the Weimar constitution. The workers' parties make the most of this, with Social Democrats and Communists regularly mobilising their supporters to attend May day rallies in the Lustgarten. They swear allegiance to socialism as they wave their red flags and sing the Internationale. But demonstrations are increasingly banned after 1928 because of street battles instigated by the communists.   

In the end, it's the National Socialists who benefit from these proletarian battles for control of Berlin's streets. In March and April 1932, the brownshirts hold their own rallies in the Lustgarten for the very first time. These right-wing rallies are initially much smaller than those organised by the anti-fascist Iron Front. But emergency decrees and bans on demonstrations mean that the supporters of the Republic are increasingly on the back foot. 

However, even after the Nazis take power, the pro-democracy Reichsbanner organisation continues to display the resistance of ""red Berlin"". On 19 February 1933, the Republicans gather in the Lustgarten for the last time. Reichsbanner leader Karl Höltermann stands on a rostrum swathed in the organisation's traditional black, red and gold. When he declares that they will fight every one of their opponents in defence of freedom, a hundred thousand voices roar: ""Freedom!"" 
",,"In preparation for the 1936 Summer Olympics, the Nazis turn the Lustgarten into a parade ground for their mass marches and rallies. After 1945 it is used by East Germany's Socialist Unity Party and renamed Marx-Engels-Platz in 1951. In the late 1990s, the park is returned to its original name and design.

",,,"“What is life without love?”
Wednesday night in Schöneberg. Hidden away at the back of Bülowstraße 37 is the entrance to the Nationalhof ballroom. The Violetta women's club is meeting in the Red Room for an ""evening of fun"". Men have to stay outside - gawkers are not welcome. The band strikes up and everyone lets their hair down.

The organiser and club leader is Lotte Hahm, a leading light of Berlin's lesbian scene. Looking dapper in her tuxedo, she gets everyone dancing the Tyrolienne. She wants everyone to dance with everyone else. Dance a few steps, then change partners - the women are always in the arms of someone new. Everyone is dancing, laughing, flirting - nobody's going home alone tonight.

An intimate, easy-going place

The Nationalhof is actually a relic of the imperial age, when it was known as the Königshof (the Royal Court). In the 1920s, it becomes a popular meeting place for gays and lesbians. A homosexual theatre company puts on shows, it's home to a glamorous men's club and the largest of the gay rights pressure groups, the Bund für Menschenrecht (Federation for Human Rights), organises dances and gay rights events.

For lesbians, the Nationalhof has its heyday between 1927 and 1929. The Violetta has about 400 members and the Nationalhof serves as their clubhouse in the heart of a neighbourhood packed with pubs and bars. The area around Nollendorfplatz is the ""lesbian love quarter"", as Curt Moreck describes it in his famous Führer durch das lasterhafte Berlin (Guide to Depraved Berlin).  The Hohenzollerndiele, Dorian Gray, Topp-Keller, Ol&aacute; l&aacute; - there's a gay bar or club on every corner.

Violetta club evenings are all about escaping everyday cares, being free to dance and find love in a laid-back, safe atmosphere. Moreck describes it as somewhere that women go to find ""diversion, entertainment, conviviality, love"", adding: ""For many lesbian women, Violetta is the home they are deprived of elsewhere.""  The Nationalhof allows them to be themselves, to find love and passion. It's a place where the predominantly young lesbians who frequent it can enjoy the kind of freedom that they are denied in the provinces.

Vibrant, diverse, creative

Berlin is the lesbian capital of the world - and the world needs to know about it. Lesbian life is vibrant and exciting, female homosexuality is no longer taboo. Dozens of clubs large and small, like Violetta and its main competitor Monbijou, jostle to attract members by placing ads in magazines like Die Freundin and Ledige Frauen. Cool clubs like the Nationalhof hold sailor parties with tug-of-war competitions, ""Purple Nights"" with showers of sweets, costume balls and special evenings for transvestites, crossdressers and drag queens. Gay culture is flourishing with a diverse, creative nightlife.

But, even before 1933, there are campaigns to criminalise lesbian lifestyles and denounce female homosexuality as immoral. Before long, magazine advertising is prohibited, and in 1932 the police chief bans the LGBT community from holding public dances. Raids and police checks ruin ladies' evenings in bars and clubs. Then the Nazis take power and outlaw homosexuality, forcing lesbian Berlin to go underground.
",,"In 1943 the Nationalhof changes hands and reopens as Walterchen's Ballhaus. With his ties to the black market, businessman Walter Draesel has high hopes for the club. But he struggles to restore its former glamour in the conservative post-war period. The Nationalhof is demolished in 1975, ten years after Walterchen's demise. The only reminder of its existence is the single column that stands in front of today's building.

",,,"A think tank for freedom-lovers
Medical students Helmut Coper and Stanislaw Kubicki take a dim view of how Berlin's University at Unter den Linden has turned into a communist-style institution. Students who are not loyal to the regime risk being arrested and hauled off by Soviet counter-intelligence agents. They want an independent, outward-looking university!

Students are increasingly being spied on and forced to attend compulsory lectures on politics. This leads to ever-louder calls for a new, independent university to be set up. Defying threats of consequences, 2,000 students stage a protest at the Esplanade Hotel on the border with the Soviet sector. 

Out of the lecture hall and onto the streets 

They want an education policy that is not based on party loyalties but on international democratic standards. Their demands are given a sympathetic hearing. General George Hay, High Commissioner of the US sector, sets up a special committee and gives the project the go ahead. This is followed by a meeting of professors, lecturers, politicians and students, including West Berlin's Mayor, Ernst Reuter. This group is now responsible for the process of setting up the Free University. The first job is to find the right location.  

Nothing can stop them - even the Berlin Blockade 

Helmut Coper and his friend Stanislaw Kubicki help to set up the university's secretariat. The building at Boltzmannstraße 4, where you are now standing, survives the war intact but at first it lacks basic amenities. In the absence of tables and chairs, documents are laid out on the floor. Fortunately, the building has a telephone, as lots of people are already interested in applying for a place. Helmut Coper is elected Chairman of the General Student Council and works closely with Ernst Reuter and the US authorities. 

Their help is vital, particularly during the Berlin Blockade, when power cuts mean that lectures have to be given by candlelight. And the students? After their long fight for an independent university, they're not going to be deterred by a few power cuts or a lack of furniture - and certainly not the two friends who receive enrolment numbers 1 and 2: Kubicki and Coper.

",,,"The world’s great religions come together under one roof
Berlin is full of churches - but from 2019 it will be home to a truly unique place of worship. The House of One is the first interfaith building designed for Christians, Jews and Muslims. This revolutionary idea of a common place of worship for all three monotheistic religions has attracted its fair share of praise and criticism alike. Can such a project really succeed?

Lack of publicity is certainly not a problem for the project's founders. When they first announced their unusual plan for the House of One, they attracted worldwide attention, including reports in the Washington Post and the Arab news channel Al Jazeera. At a time of global religious conflict, the world's first combination of church, mosque and synagogue is causing quite a stir.   

Check out the plans for the House of One online - you'll see a modern brick building divided into separate sections. Each religion has its own space for worship and there is a communal room where worshippers and members of the public can come together and learn more about each other's religions. The Berlin architectural firm Kuehn Malvezzi has pared the traditional characteristics of sacred buildings back to their most elementary forms. It was important to ensure that no one religion was seen to predominate.  

How is it possible to have a communal building where the three religious communities still have their own space? This question is often asked, but Imam Kadir Sanci is confident it will work: ""I think our building is like a shared flat. We all live together. Everyone has their own room, but there's a kitchen where we can all meet up. We're not looking to create a new religion or mix them up. We're all different, but we belong together."" 

But the project also has its critics. Journalist Maritta Adam-Tkalec has openly addressed the difficulties experienced by Christians and Jews in finding a ""strong Muslim partner"". Many Berlin Muslims do not accept the Gülen movement, which is now on board, as the sole representative of Islam.  

A wooden hut stands on Petriplatz, where the GDR government once ordered the demolition of Berlin's oldest church. It holds a scale model of the communal room that will be built in the House of One. The success of this 43-million-euro project also depends on the success of the crowdfunding campaign.  

The idea originated in the Protestant community of Father Gregor Hohberg. He remains optimistic: ""There's a real desire for religions to co-exist in harmony. Now we have to find a way to turn this desire into donations."" The project has funding in place until the foundation stone is laid in 2019.

The door opens and stale smoke wafts out. Last night's party is still going. Saw blades hang from the ceiling. These are the lampshades over the flickering light bulbs that bathe the room in a dim light. A black dildo dangles overhead. The walls are covered with graffiti. You're in a public toilet - but two Berliners have given it a new identity. This is the last night before its summer break.

The loo gets a second life 

Zur Klappe - Toilet this way. That's what it says above the entrance. Is that graffiti next to it meant to be a warning? - Not so nice. From the central reservation on the Mehringdamm, on the corner of Yorckstraße, a staircase leads down to a place that is a combination of gallery, bar and club. Behind the entrance to the first room there's a toilet. Until a few years ago, this was the site of a public toilet, a ""cottage"" - a place where gay men meet for sex. Under the National Socialists, these places offered gay men a modicum of safety and freedom. During the 1980s, gay men in West Berlin also had to resort to cottaging because intercourse between men was still illegal. The cottages became vital elements of homosexual subculture.  

But the toilet in the centre of Kreuzberg is very dilapidated. The council is on the verge of knocking it down, but it is rescued by its current operators, Flint Neiber and Sören van Laak. The young men spend three years trying to get official approval for their plans, never giving up hope until the tenancy agreement is finally in their hands. Then they have a lot of work to do. They have to dry out the rooms, dispose of the waste and connect the water, gas and electricity. Ventilation is vital in underground rooms like these.  

The club's owners deliberately make few changes to the fabric of the building and preserve most of the 1980s graffiti. The original tiles and condom machine in the toilets give the place its special charm.  

Space for creative freedom 

""We make the rooms available to artists. They can exhibit their works there, "" says one of the owners. Yet again, they have demonstrated how a little creativity can bring Berlin's abandoned places back to life. Members of Berlin's subculture have always had to fight for their freedom to create.  

The club celebrates its official opening in January 2018. An artist marks the occasion with an exhibition of photos about the location and cottaging in Berlin entitled Fenster zum Klo (Window on the toilet). After its first six months, the club is taking a summer break. Time to let some air in.

",,,"Berlin’s socialist city crown
Largely for political reasons, the iconic Berlin TV Tower is constructed in the heart of the city. The East German regime wants to prove something to West Germany and the world - and it does.

If East Germany's Post Services had pushed through its original plans in 1952, you would not visit the TV Tower on Alexanderplatz today, but at the Müggelsee lake.  

In part due to East Germany's bureaucratic and fault-prone command economy, the TV Tower project starts out like a disaster waiting to happen. The project haemorrhages vast amounts of money with never a sign of a building.  

And time is pressing. In the newly-established East Germany, the available TV and radio frequencies in the ""Workers' and Peasants' State"" are far from ideal. The SED regime's Central Committee fears some GDR citizens might start listening to the free channels from West Germany, and they cannot afford to risk such ""media emigration"".  

Searching for a landmark site   

Appropriately enough, East Germany's leaders in the 1960s are looking for an impressive symbol of their socialist society's superiority. Ultimately, various political motives speak for the new TV Tower as an architectural demonstration of power in the centre of Berlin.  

Allegedly in 1964, Walter Ulbricht, then East Germany's head of state, personally stands in front of a model of Berlin, gestures at Alexanderplatz and says: ""Well, Comrades, you can easily see for yourself - that's where the tower belongs."" Certainly, Ulbricht gives the signal for what is, at that time, an unparalleled building project in the GDR. He wants a ""socialist city crown"" for Berlin.  

Ulbricht is looking for a distinctive landmark - and finds it in the tower's simple yet iconic spherical shape. This design has another advantage. Everyone seeing the tower's sphere recalls the famous Russian satellite Sputnik 1 - the perfect model for socialism's symbolic victory.  

The spiralling costs are kept secret   

From 1965, in just under four-and-a-half years, the world's second highest TV Tower is finished. Berlin's TV Tower is 365 metres high, making it also the third highest freestanding building of its day after Moscow's Ostzankino TV Tower and New York's Empire State Building. When the tower is unveiled in 1969, Walter Ulbricht is not the only one who calls it a sensation. The city's new landmark quickly starts to draw the crowds. 

With the TV Tower, East Germany creates an architectural and design masterpiece outshining anything in West Germany, which has far more economic clout. And over the following years, the GDR enjoys the success of its tower to the full. Yet the East German state is more than coy about the cost. Its citizens are not told the actual price tag of this icon of socialist planning - 132 million Marks, four times the original budget.  

After the Berlin Wall falls in 1989, some critical voices call for demolishing the TV Tower. Fortunately, this radical suggestion is ignored. Today, the TV Tower attracts over one million visitors a year from as many as 86 different countries. The tower has long ceased to be a symbol of the SED dictatorship in East Germany, and firmly become a symbol of a free and modern Berlin.

Cheers ring out when Joe Hatchiban rides his converted bike into the amphitheatre and sets up his music system. It's time for karaoke in the Mauerpark.

Right here, where the first singer is getting ready, this was part of the death zone that divided the city until 1989. The area has a colourful history. Once farmland, in the 19th century it was turned into a military parade ground. Berliners called the area ""The Lone Poplar"" after its solitary poplar tree. Later on, it became the site of a sports facility and a freight station. From 1961 to 1989, the site was part of the no-mans-land between East and West Berlin.  

The area opens up again after the fall of the Wall, and Berliners are quick to claim it as their own. Five years later, it has been transformed into a public space, the Mauerpark. Together with the huge flea market next door, it fast becomes one of the city's most popular attractions.   

In 2009 Joe Hatchiban starts putting on karaoke sessions in the park, and they quickly become world famous. They are not about great singing. Nobody needs to feel embarrassed. You just need the courage to get up and have fun. Right now, an older guy is singing La Bamba. He barely hits a note. But the crowd loves it anyway and thanks him with loud applause. 

In front of the stage, someone is riding a bike dressed as a frog. Two girls are sunbathing topless. A juggler starts warming up. The air smells of barbecued food. You can try your hand at spray painting a section of the Wall - all legal and above board. It's a place for people to have fun and enjoy the freedom that epitomises Berlin.

Berlin Mitte",52.5085781,13.3681941,Museum,2,TRUE,Kulturforum,"This art and culture ensemble, which is not just architecturally diverse, lies between Potsdamer Platz and the Landwehr Canal.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there may be closures and changed opening hours. Please have a look at the individual houses/institutions.",,,"The Kulturforum looks back on an extensive evolutionary and architectural history, which is also reflected in the very different architectural styles of the buildings.

At the end of the 1950s, plans existed for a cultural axis across Berlin. They were based on the ideas of the architect Hans Scharoun, who was at that time president of the Akademie der Künste (Academy of Arts). The wall had not yet been built, and the axis was to extend from the Museum Island in the east to Charlottenburg Palace in the west.

The site of the present-day Kulturforum is located in Mitte. As a result of massive planning interventions during the Nazi era and the devastation of the Second World War, the area there lay fallow. A new cultural centre for a burgeoning post-war Berlin was to be built on it.

It was to provide visitors with the opportunity to enjoy art, listen to music, and study scientific writings in future. The impact of the individual institutes would be heightened by concentrating them on one spot – that was the plan.

Then came the building of the Berlin Wall and the Kulturforum, located close to the wall, became an important prestige project for the West. This not only meant it had to hold its own during the ongoing strife with the GDR regime, but also send a clear message to West Germany. The repatriation of the art and literature outsourced to the Federal Republic of Germany went anything but quickly. The construction of suitable buildings aimed to put pressure on bringing them back to West Berlin.

Everything takes time
A start was made in the 1960s and 1970s with three designs by two internationally renowned architects. The Philharmonie by Hans Scharoun marked the beginning of the construction activity at the Kulturforum. It celebrated its opening in 1963. Its unusual tent-like roof and yellow façade contrasted with the strict, functionalist form of the New National Gallery by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, which opened five years later.

The buildings made St. Matthew’s Church, which has been situated within the complex since the 19th century, seem somewhat antiquated. St. Matthäus-Kirche in the Kulturforum Berlin is a historical centre, a space for contemporary art and a religious place of peace for Berliners and Berlin visitors.

Scharoun's long-standing employee Edgar Wisniewski realised the Kammermusiksaal (Chamber Music Hall) and the Musikinstrumentenmuseum (Musical Instrument Museum) according to his plans. The Museum opened in 1984, and the Kammermusiksaal in 1987 to mark the 750th anniversary of the city of Berlin.

In the 1970s, the Staatsbibliothek was built on the other side of Potsdamer Strasse according to Scharoun's designs. It was opened in 1978, six years after the death of the architect. The neighbouring Ibero-American Institute was also based on one of Scharoun's designs.

The construction of the Staatsbibliothek devoured more money than originally estimated, which led to a delay in starting the construction of the other art houses planned.

Museum architecture in transition
West Berlin had already held an architectural competition in 1965 for the design of the entire Kulturforum. The expectations were high, and the most compelling design was to offer no less than a “structural characterisation of what a museum means for us today”.

In the eyes of the jury, no competitor would be able to achieve this ambitious goal. As a compromise, the responsible parties agreed to award the contract to the Stuttgart architect Rolf Gutbrod.

His designs dated back to a period in which the tasks and functions of museum architecture were questioned. What was the reciprocal relationship between the museums and the collections they housed? Which target groups were to be addressed?

The architect considered his designs to be an alternative to the classical and neo-baroque buildings on the Museum Island. His museums should not be intimidating but encourage people of all social strata to visit.

The Kunstgewerbemuseum (Museum of Decorative Arts) opened in 1985. Based on a 20-year-old design, the concept of the building with its brutalist façade and dominant stairwells had become outdated. And it wasn’t well received by the public: the criticism was so devastating, Gutbrod had to resign. It was initially unclear as to how things should proceed with the Kulturforum.

The Munich architects Heinz Hilmer and Christoph Sattler were awarded the contract to revise Gutbrod’s designs for the Kupferstichkabinett (Gallery of Prints and Drawings) and Kunstbibliothek. They changed numerous details and did away with the envisaged exposed concrete columns in the exhibition hall, for example.
The opening took place in 1994. With its façade clad in concrete and clinker brick, the building today is emphatically reserved.

The Gemäldegalerie was also the work of Hilmer and Sattler and opened in 1998. They needed to adapt their design because the location and entrance had been determined by Gutbrod. The architects abandoned prestigious façades and focussed on the quality of the interior design. Classically cut halls with perfect lighting conditions accentuated the precious collection.

The future of the Kulturforum
The New National Gallery has been closed since 2014 due to renovation work and is planned to reopen in 2020. Furthermore, there has long been insufficient exhibition space to display all the collections from the 20th century.

The Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation thus held a competition in 2015 for a new museum building: the Nationalgallerie20, the museum of the 20th century.
Developing the open space between the Philharmonie and New National Gallery is to create a stronger spatial link between all the buildings.

The competition’s winning design came from the Swiss architects Herzog & De Meuron. The opening should take place in the mid-2020s.","Opening hours

The first ""Tartufeln"" (potatoes) were also planted in the Lustgarten. In the 17th century, the garden was transformed by the Great Elector into his own ornate pleasure garden. Under Friedrich Wilhelm I, the grass was cleared away, filled with sand and used as a parade ground. At the end of the 18th Century, Friedrich Wilhelm II replanted the park. After the establishment of a museum built by Karl Friedrich Schinkel Museum (now known as the Altes Museum), the Lustgarten was renovated in regard to its architecture and landscape by Schinkel and Peter Joseph Lenné. In the 20th Century, it underwent a further transformation, serving as a space for political gatherings. The Nazis levelled it and paved it over so it could be used for mass marches and rallies.

Today the Lustgarten’s grass once again invites all those hungering for sun to come and spend some time sunbathing. The biggest attraction at the Lustgarten was and is the granite bowl. It was considered as being a wonder of the Biedermeier era and was one of the main attractions in 19th century royal Berlin. It weighs 70 tonnes and was brought to Berlin in 1828 on a boat travelling on the River Spree. For its inauguration in 1834, a special breakfast was organised. Around 40 people were sitting in the bowl. On account of its size, it has affectionately become known in Berlin slang as the ""Berlin soup bowl.""

Built in the Italianate style with a separate bell tower and located directly on Jungfernsee, the little church has a Mediterranean charm that is sure to charm you.
The architecture of the Heilandskirche
Friedrich Wilhelm IV himself provided the original sketches and drafts for a small church with a campanile – a separate bell tower – in the architectural style that was common in Italy, but not in Prussia. His favourite architect Ludwig Persius was commissioned to design the church in 1844. It is close to the manor house known as Sacrower Schloss, in a park designed by Peter Joseph Lenné. The park belongs to the UNESCO world heritage site known as the Palaces and Parks of Berlin and Potsdam.
The church is designed to look like a ship at anchor, and is inspired by early Christian religious buildings. It has a shallow roof and gives the impression of a three-aisled basilica. The building is made of yellow brick, decorated with blue tiles. An arcade runs along the sides of the church facing the lake and offers wonderful views across the water. Inside, there is an eye-catching fresco in the Byzantine style. The campanile is made of the same yellow brick as the church, and has a plaque commemorating the fact that in 1897 it was used as an antenna for the first wireless telegraph transmission in Germany.
The Heilandskirche in the GDR
For many years, the church was in a state of limbo, because the border to West Berlin ran right through it. Trapped in no-man’s land, it was left to decay. The congregation celebrated its last Christmas service in 1961, after which it was vandalised by East German border guards and sealed off to prevent anyone from escaping across the site. The guards even reinforced the campanile with concrete slabs and used it as a watchtower. West Berliners were forced to put up with the sight of its increasing dilapidation until 1984/85, when the mayor of West Berlin, Richard von Weizsäcker, finally persuaded the East German authorities to at least restore the façades.
The Heilandskirche today
On Christmas Eve 1989, just after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the congregation once again celebrated a service in the still-ruined church. Extensive restoration began in 1993, and today there are services and concerts at this romantic jewel of a church, as well as weddings, where the bride can arrive by boat.",,,"Hidden places in Berlin

A word that not only makes the heart of architecture fans beat faster. Walter Gropius, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Marcel Breuer, Paul Klee, Johannes Itten, Marianne Brandt and Gunta Stölzl are just a few of the names that stand for one of the most influential art movements in the field of 20th century architecture, art and design.

Fit for everyday use and without frills
In 1919, architect Walter Gropius founded the Bauhaus in Weimar as an art school. He adopted the principles and methods of Henry van de Velde’s Kunstgewerblichen Institut (Institute of Applied Arts). Inspired by the masons’ guilds of the Middle Ages, masters and students attempted to combine art and craftsmanship. The educational institution focused on a new form of building that broke with the historicism of the imperial era. As in the ""Werkbund"" movement, the ""Bauhäusler"" produced works and designs for industrial mass production: their aim was to create functional everyday products with clear design that were affordable for everyone.

Politically and financially under pressure from right-wing parties and the Thuringian government, the school moved to Dessau in 1925. A similar situation was to happen there in 1932: the National Socialists won the municipal elections in Dessau in 1931 and forced the closure of the Bauhaus. The school then moved to Berlin-Lankwitz. There, political reprisals finally led to the closure of the private institution, with some of the pupils and teachers having to emigrate abroad.

Ulm 1955: Opening of the Hochschule für Gestaltung (School of Design). Here is where art historian Hans Maria Wingler met the Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius. Wingler began to deal intensively with the history of the Bauhaus, gathering documents and objects. He came across artistic remains, collected donations and preserved designs by former Bauhaus students. The collection grew.

Darmstadt slope becomes Berlin plane
In 1960 Hans Maria Wingler founded the Bauhaus Archive. Initially he exhibited his collection in Ernst Ludwig House on the Mathildenhöhe in Darmstadt. But soon the space proved insufficient. He needed his own building. In 1964 Walter Gropius drafted a design for this new building, which was to be built on the Rosenhöhe in Darmstadt. But these plans came to nothing, as the envisaged 6 million DM in construction costs were too much for the Darmstadt municipality.

Years later another solution was found: the city of Berlin promised the Bauhaus Archive a new home and to fully finance the new building. An attractive offer. In 1971, the Bauhaus Archive moved to the River Spree, initially moving to Schlossstraße 1a in Charlottenburg, which today is home to the Bröhan-Museum für Jugendstil, Art déco und Funktionalismus (Bröhan Museum for Art Nouveau, Art Deco and Functionalism).
The groundbreaking ceremony for the new building would take another five years, during which time Walter Gropius passed away and his long-standing collaborator Alexander Cvijanovic took on responsibility for further planning and construction.
The architect was confronted with a number of problems: Gropius’ Darmstadt design was based on a hillside location. In Berlin, however, Cvijanovic was assigned a flat plot in Klingelhöferstraße in Tiergarten (Berlin Mitte). In addition, Gropius’ design envisaged a prestigious north façade. However, the Berlin building had to face the Landwehr Canal, running to the south of the plot of land.

Cvijanovic found the right solutions. He rotated the building 180 degrees to the south compared with the original design, among other things. Further changes were also made, including the striking pedestrian ramp designed by him, which leads visitors to the entrance of the Bauhaus Archive.
Original Gropius ideas, on the other hand, include the distinctive saw-tooth roofs, whose light openings allow light to enter without the glare of the sun or shadows. Simple and functional, a little futuristic. No wonder then that the building served as the location for the American science fiction film “Æon Flux”.

The Bauhaus Archive opened in 1979: the core of the collection, which grew steadily since then, consisted of the artistic remains gathered by Hans Maria Wingler. Draft drawings, manuscripts, letters. The aim of the Bauhaus Archive was to illustrate the history, practice and impact of this avant-garde art movement internationally.

A new building is needed
The museum has been closed since summer 2018 while the old building undergoes a process of complete renovation and technical modernisation. As the collection continued to grow over the decades, an extension became unavoidable and a competition was launched for its design.

In 2015, architect Volker Staab won the competition with his design for a glass museum tower. The extension is to be completed by 2022. “The temporary Bauhaus-Archiv/Museum für Gestaltung” in Knesebeckstraße 1-2 in Charlottenburg has opened for the transition. It offers smaller exhibitions as well as a programme, which you can find at www.bauhaus.de.

In the centenary of the Bauhaus in 2019, the Bauhaus Archive in cooperation with the Berlinische Galerie is organising the exhibition Original Bauhaus (06/09/2019 to 27/01/2020).

Berlin",52.5162688,13.3511155,Architecture,2,FALSE,Schloss Bellevue,"From Theodor Heuss to Frank-Walter Steinmeier – all of them have resided here while in office, because Schloss Bellevue is the seat of the Germany’s president.",,,"Art historians have long argued about the palace architecture – is it still Baroque or is it already Neoclassical? These days, the architecture of the three-winged, two-storey palace is classed as Early Neoclassical. A compromise, in other words. Clear lines without much embellishment – the typical features of a seat of power, but still the building is rather uncharacteristic. But why not make up your own mind?

A residence for princes and celebrities

Schloss Bellevue was commissioned in 1785 by Prince August Ferdinand of Prussia. The white building in the northern part of the Tiergarten was completed two years later. At that time, there was only one side wing along with the main building. The property was used by Frederick the Great’s youngest brother as a residence and was not intended for show. It was characterised by its simplicity, but stood out with one of the finest landscape gardens of the time. The guest list featured many famous personalities: the German poet and dramatist Friedrich von Schiller and the French ruler Napoleon Bonaparte both visited the prince at his residential palace.  

The precursor of the National Gallery

Several decades and Prussian kings later, the palace was converted to an art museum known as the Vaterländische Galerie. From 1844, contemporary Prussian works were exhibited in the rooms on the ground floor. King Friedrich-Wilhelm IV allowed the public access to the palace gardens. After 21 years, the artworks moved out again and the palace was used by the Prussian imperial court, housing royal gardeners, maids, cooks, grooms, valets, gamekeepers and saddlers.

The palace survived the first world war unscathed and passed into the possession of the Weimar government. It was used to house state visitors and thus, for the first time, as a representative building. It was less fortunate during the second world war – apart from a few exterior walls, the whole palace was reduced to ruins.

From the White House back to Berlin

The palace in the Tiergarten was rebuilt from 1955 to 1959. During this time, the German parliament declared it the second seat of office and residence of the President, who until then had only resided at the Villa Hammerschmidt in Bonn. In a slightly late response to Germany's reunification, the Bundespräsident moved to the capital permanently in 1994.

Richard von Weizsäcker “swapped” the order of the president’s seats of office and residence. Since then, Schloss Bellevue in Berlin has been the president’s primary home, and the “White House of Bonn” has been relegated to second place. As big and beautiful as the palace may be, most presidents prefer not to move privately into Bellevue with its view of the Spree. The palace is used for New Year’s receptions, and for state and inaugural visits. Once a year there is an open day, when the general public are invited to visit, and for just one day feel like princes and princesses, kings and queens, or presidents.

The ancient– the flag that flies outside Schloss Bellevue – is taken down when the president is at his residence in Bonn, on a trip abroad or visiting another Bundesland.

And from the dizzying height of its viewing platform, you have spectacular 360-degree panoramic views out across the entire city – and beyond!

History of the TV Tower

The Berlin TV Tower was inaugurated on 3 October 1969 – shortly before East Germany held its twentieth anniversary celebrations. For Walter Ulbricht, then East Germany’s head of state, the TV Tower, constructed in just four years, was emblematic of the communist system's superiority – unequivocal evidence that the GDR was building a better future. The tower was designed by Hermann Henselmann and the group of architects around Fritz Dieter, Günter Franke and Werner Neumann in the state-owned enterprise Industrieprojektierung (Ipro) Berlin. For a time, the executive manager for the entire project was Gerhard Kosel, then President of the GDR’s Deutsche Bauakademie in Berlin.

East Germany, though, has long been history. But the TV Tower is still drawing the crowds – and is ranked among the top sights in twenty-first century Germany. After German reunification, the TV Tower took on an entirely new significance. No longer just a symbol of East Germany, the TV Tower quickly became an integral element of Berlin’s new cityscape, and soon came to symbolise the city – both nationally and internationally.

In 1979, during the days of East Germany, the TV Tower was already classified as a heritage building. Today, it welcomes over one million visitors annually from 86 countries. The viewing platform, over 200 metres up, offers spectacular views of this bustling city with its heady mix of history, cutting edge modernity and change. The TV Tower’s aptly named Panorama Bar and revolving Sphere Restaurant are also ideal places to linger over drinks and refreshments and enjoy the breathtaking views.

Clear early morning skies – and not a cloud in sight? Then it’s time to hop out of bed and head for the TV Tower. For this popular tourist sight, the early riser really does skip the queues for the lift, especially on sunny days. And that avoids those long waiting times which children (and adults!) can find so tiresome. But whether you are an early riser or not, it’s always worth checking the weather beforehand – and booking fast track tickets. Our tip: Book e-tickets – and choose the time for the lift which suits you best!

Berlin",52.5332373,13.3802213,Gallery,2,FALSE,Chaussee 36,"Chaussee 36 is an architecturally significant building with Prussian roots and old world charm. Newly restored, the various spaces are used for readings, concerts, and exhibitions.",,,"Built in 1886, this former Prussian officer's home was finally returned to his heirs after the fall of the Berlin Wall. They then sold it to the present owners,

who are lovingly restoring the building piece-by-piece. Still in a partly unfinished state, unspoilt old architecture meets modern design to create spaces that are a reminder of the splendour and wealth of older times.

Salon 36

As part of the extensive reconstruction of the different floors and areas in the house, Salon 36 has become an event space for special occasions. The Salon can be hired for celebrations such as gala evenings, readings, and exhibitions. With a total area of 250 m2, the space includes separate rooms for catering, office and storage space, where event organisers can work behind the scenes.

Residenz 36 

Stylishly designed rooms can be rented. Modern technology was cleverly integrated into the historic buildings. Spacious windows and high ceilings make the rooms bright and inviting.

Galerie 36

The gallery offers plenty of space for exhibitions of any kind. Artists from Germany and beyond come here to exhibit their works. Many of them are photographers, often presenting shots taken in and around Berlin. The Chaussee 36 website includes a scheduled of upcoming exhibitions under the heading ""Galerie 36"".

Studio 36  

The site's event location is known as Studio 36. The exposed brick walls lend the whole a rustic charm. The studio is also ideal for unusual photo shoots or as a versatile location for filming thanks to its unfinished look that can be adapted as needed. The lighting conditions in the space are also particularly advantageous here, with large windows guaranteeing good light for any photo or film project.

Chaussee 36 is worth a visit, whatever the occasion. Whether you come here for a musical event or an exhibition, this historical officer's house will captivate you as soon as you cross the threshold.

Berlin",52.5181534,13.3969444,Museum,2,TRUE,Deutsches Historisches Museum,The museum for German history,,,"Housed in the baroque Zeughaus on Unter den Linden, the Deutsches Historisches Museum (German Historical Museum) tells the story of 2,000 years of German history. Across 8,000 square metres and 7,000 exhibits you can chart the conquests of Charlemagne, uncover Luther's Theses, learn about the origins of the Second World War and get acquainted with German reunification. A chronologically-arranged layout takes you from the early-Middle Ages to the present day. The exhibits shift engagingly between art and everyday objects: paintings of historical scenes sit alongside armour, a vacuum cleaner alongside GDR sheet music.
A tour from the Middle Ages to the present day
Chancellor Helmut Kohl signed the museum’s founding document in 1987 – a fitting event to mark the city’s 750th anniversary. The West German government was enthusiastic about the ambitious plan and laid the foundation stone at the Spreebogen, the bend in the river Spree in West Berlin. When the Wall fell, things changed: the German Historical Museum foundation, which was still in its infancy, received all the relevant collections and moved into the historic Zeughaus: an important baroque building and former armoury, and the oldest building on Unter den Linden. This is where the permanent exhibition of the German Historical Museum is now on display, presenting German history in a European context and in chronological order. The variety of artefacts is impressive – in addition to medieval knight’s armour, filigree embroidered uniform jackets from the 18th century and pictures and election posters from the Weimar Republic, there is also an original piece of the Berlin Wall.
Although all the exhibits address historical processes, revolutionary events and especially draw attention to the people behind them, they are all very different. Thus the focus is not only on important historical events and their important actors, but also on small everyday activities. Time and again, the German Historical Museum lets you immerse yourself in the everyday lives of ordinary people. It displays church collection plates, ladies’ high fashion from the 19th century and even admission tickets for the Nuremberg war crimes trials.
In 2003, the modern exhibition area designed by the American-Chinese architect Ieoh Ming Pei was opened. It is a successful addition to the historic main building and features temporary exhibitions on current historical and political issues.

Today, the memorial centre at Sachsenhausen tells the story of the concentration camp at the sites where it took place.
The concentration camp
The site of what is now the Sachsenhausen memorial centre was one of the biggest concentration camps on German territory from 1936 to 1945. The T Building housed the central administration office for all the concentration camps. The part of the camp known as the “Zone of Interest”, along with many auxiliary camps, housed around 200,000 inmates who were enslaved and exploited as forced labour by local industry. Several tens of thousands of prisoners died as a result the inhumane working and living conditions and the brutal treatment, or were gassed, shot or subjected to medical experiments.
In April 1945, with the Red Army already approaching, the SS began evacuating the camp and sent the inmates on “death marches”, in which thousands were shot or died of exhaustion. Today, a branch of the memorial centre commemorates the death march with an exhibition in Belower Wald.
On 22 and 23 April 1945, Soviet and Polish troops reached the camp, where even after liberation, hundreds died as a result of their imprisonment.
After the Second World War
From 1945 to 1950 the site was used as a special camp by the NKVD, the Soviet secret service. It was what was known as a silent camp, and around 60,000 internees lived there under the most miserable conditions. Around 12,000 of them died due to conditions in the camp, hunger and disease.
Sachsenhausen memorial centre and museum
In 1961 the site was declared a national place of memorial and remembrance in the GDR. Since 1993, the memorial centre and museum at Sachsenhausen have belonged to the Stiftung Brandenburgische Gedenkstätten, the foundation which maintains memorials in Brandenburg. In the 1990s, work began on preserving the original locations as memorials, 13 new permanent exhibitions were opened and the architect HG Merz redesigned the central place of remembrance, Station Z.
The memorial centre is an open place of learning. Rather than everything being in one place, you can walk around the original locations, the huts, the cells and the administrative centre, and find out about the concentration camp. At the visitor information centre, you are given a general suggestion of where to go, and an overview of the exhibitions. A visitor guide system provides further information and takes you to the various sites.",,,"Third Reich Memorials

You will need to visit several times to see even a small part of this collection, which features over 500,000 prints and 110,000 drawings, watercolours and oil sketches. Here, you will find almost everything: from figurative studies and sketches through to landscapes in pastel. The collection features works by artists as diverse as Albrecht Dürer, Caspar David Friedrich and Andy Warhol. The museum runs several special exhibitions each year. Thanks to a study hall, you can also check out specific works.

Graphics and watercolours in red, blue or green
Elector Friedrich Wilhelm of Brandenburg is a passionate collector of drawings and watercolours in the mid-17th century. They are housed his Library Court, and this collection forms the basis of the 1831 Kupferstichkabinett, which grows quickly. In 1835, it is augmented by approximately 50,000 exhibits from the Prussian Postmeister General Karl Ferdinand Friedrich von Nagler. Among these works are Albrecht Dürer and Matthias Grünewald. Later, drawings and prints are added. Here, you can reconstruct the creation processes of all the large paintings. Prepare for fascinating moments retracing the preparatory works behind your favourite paintings. At the Kupferstichkabinett, you can see the sketches and drawings that prefigure the masterpieces. Since 1994, the Kupferstichkabinett has been part of the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin, housed in the Kulturforum at Potsdamer Platz. Plan your visit in advance: the Cabinet runs special temporary exhibitions. You can experience Picasso's Minotaur or Munch's depictions of death in a very special atmosphere. Andy Warhol's colourful portraits of Marilyn Monroe, which you may be familiar with, contribute to the Pop Art collection. Works form the 19th century also feature: Caspar David Friedrich's melancholic romantic landscapes for example, or lithographs by Auguste Renoir. If you are looking for a particular work, take advantage of the service in the study room where it is easy to browse and study in peace and quiet.

You will also enjoy the art library in the same building as the Kupferstichkabinett. More than a million volumes on the subject of art and related media are available here, for example; ornament engravings, photography of the 1920s or fashion magazines from the 19th century. Directly opposite the Kulturforum, you'll find the Gemäldegalerie. This picture gallery is dedicated to European painting from the 13th to the 18th century. Here you can see masterpieces by Rembrandt, Dürer, Holbein and Titian. Plan some extra time to see the biggest collection of Italian Renaissance artist Botticelli north of the Alps. In addition to the Kulturforum, the Museum for Film and Television in the Sony Center on Potsdamer Platz presents the history of cinematography in film and TV. Here you can discover original screenplays, film posters and photos, for example Fritz Lang's silent film ""Metropolis"". The Marlene Dietrich Collection is particularly interesting: here you can view costumes and photos of the legendary actress. Near Potsdamer Platz is the Martin-Gropius-Bau. The building houses changing exhibitions of cultural history, archaeology, contemporary art and photography. Inform yourself about Walter Gropius, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Le Courbusier at the Bauhaus Archive. If you look at the exhibits on design, you will be surprised by how much the Bauhaus actually shapes our lives. The archive is a walk or short bus ride from Potsdamer Platz. Watch out for the white wave-shaped building on the shore of the River Spree: the Shell House is an especially beautiful example of 1920s architecture in Berlin.","Opening hours

Berlin",52.5191843,13.2967373,Gallery,2,FALSE,The Scharf-Gerstenberg Collection,250 years of fantastic art,,,"At the beginning of the 20th century, Otto Gerstenberg is well known as a prominent German business man, as well as a passionate art collector. His collection features works by famous French Impressionists, including Monet, Renoir, Degas, Gauguin and the complete print work of Toulouse Lautrec. The Surrealist movement is also represented by well-known artists such as Dalí, René Magritte, Max Ernst and Paul Klee. During the Second World War, the collection is reduced considerably, and in 1961, it is left to Gerstenberg's grandsons, Walther and Dieter Scharf. The paintings of Piranesi, Klinger, Manet and Goya, as well as Dieter's own collection of graphics and paintings by Salvador Dalí, Jean Dubuffet, Max Ernst, René Magritte and Henri Rousseau form the basis of the museum. The museum opens again in 2008, thanks to a ten-year loan agreement, and is now part of the National Gallery of Berlin.

From Piranesi's prison paintings to the world of Dalí
The 250 artworks in the National Gallery's ""Surreal Worlds"" permanent collection - painting, sculptures and works on paper - is spread over three floors. It is a journey through 250 years of history lived through fantastic art. It begins with Giovanni Battista Piranesi's gloomy 'dungeon images' which depict power and decay, and the late work of Francisco de Goya: discomforting 'black pictures' from the 1820s. Late 19th century symbolism is represented in Max Klinger's graphic works, where the main themes are love, eroticism and death. Well-known names such as Max Ernst, René Magritte join Pablo Picasso, Paul Klee and Alberto Giacometti, united by the surrealist and symbolist elements in their works. More than any other surrealist, Salvador Dalí characterises the 20th century with the fantastical whimsy found in his work. The surrealist director Luis Buñuel collaborates extensively with Dalí. You can watch their films in the museum. Under Friedrich Wilhelm VI, Prussian architect Friedrich Stüler designs these buildings which are used as officer's barracks until 1859. The pavilion-like domes of the two neoclassical buildings are distinctive, connecting the museum beautifully with the Charlottenburg Palace. From 1967 to 2005, the East Stüler building also houses the Egyptian Museum.

Outstanding works
Salvador Dalí: Study for „Banlieue de la ville paranoïaque-critique“ (1935)
Hans Bellmer: La poupée (1936/1938)
Max Ernst: Le Triomphe de l'amour/fausse allégorie (1937)
Jean Dubuffet: Nez d'Apollo Pap (1953)
René Magritte: Gaspard de la nuit (1965)
Charlottenburg's high-profile art landscape
A perfect compliment for your visit to the Scharf-Gerstenberg Collection is the Berggruen Museum just across the street. The art collector Heinz Berggruen emigrates to the United States in 1936. When he returns to Berlin some 60 years, he passes his 200 works of classic modernism onto the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation. On your tour, you will experience the who's who of the masters of the art world; Pablo Picasso, Paul Klee, Henri Matisse, Georges Braque and many more. Pablo Picasso's works alone account for 100 exhibits. Only a few metres away, the Bröhan Museum charts the development of modernism in fine art and culture. The heart of the exhibition is a collection of European Art Nouveau arts and crafts. The designers Hector Guimard and Henry van de Velde, as well as the furniture designer Louis Majorelle, are among its well known names. Be amazed at the precious porcelains and fine glass art by Daum Frères and Émile Gallé among others.

North of the Scharf-Gerstenberg collection rises the magnificent Charlottenburg Palace. This was the summer residence of Queen Sophie Charlotte until 1699. Stroll through its sumptuously furnished rooms and palace garden, and marvel at the famous collection of Royal porcelain. The Schinkel Pavilion in the park shines with paintings by Caspar David Friedrich and Eduard Gaerner. On the edge of the Middle Schustehruspark district, the Wilhelmian Villa Oppenheim stands proudly. Discover how the districts of Charlottenburg and Wilmersdorf evolve at the permanent exhibition ""WEST!"" Extraordinary painting and sculpture from the 19th century is found on the upper floor of the villa. The Berlin impressionists Max Liebermann and Walter Leistikow are also represented. Right next door, you will find the Scharf-Gerstenberg antique cast collection. Around 2,000 antique plaster casts are accessible to the public at the Freie Universität Berlin. You will also find faithful replicas of Greek and Roman sculptures dating from the past 3,500 years.","Opening hours

The Photographic Art Library presents artists such as Édouard Baldus (circa 1850), Edward Steichen (circa 1900) and Willy Römer (circa 1920).

Provocative and historical works from three centuries
Helmut Newton founds his eponymous foundation and is allowed by the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation to permanently use the Landwehr Casino. In 2004, (shortly after Newton's death) the 2,000 square metre museum opens. The ground and first floors exhibited the Newton Foundation. The permanent exhibition is called Helmut Newton's private property and explores the artist's various phases: from early photographs from his childhood in Berlin to his models' accessories. View a film about Newton's personal way of working. Temporary exhibitions show celebrated photo collections such as Sex and Landscapes, Pigozzi and the Paparazzi or Men, War & Peace. In addition, discover the work of his wife Alice Springs. Rooms contrast strikingly in this unique collection. The staircase to the Imperial Hall is, however, almost empty, and the few recordings hung up there are the more silent stars. The hall itself presents changing exhibitions of the Art Library's collection of photography, which spans 19th to the 21st century photographic art, for example, old town views and documentary footage or the new objectivity of the 1920s.

Berlin",52.5704293,13.5656749,Architecture,2,FALSE,Ahrensfelder Terraces,Mediterranean flair in Marzahn,,,"Today, international urban researchers make pilgrimages to Marzahn to find out more about the sustainable renovation of a prefabricated high-rise building estate.
In Ahrensfelde, at the end of the S-Bahn line 7, the modern architecture holds a surprise in store. Between the high-rise buildings of the large GDR housing estates you will find smaller buildings in warm colours with spacious rooftop terraces: the Ahrensfelder terraces. Green spaces generously pervade the residential area – the visitor almost feels reminded of the classical modernist estates. But the Ahrensfelder terraces are an award-winning urban redevelopment project of the 21st century.
Protests against the demolition
Marzahn emerged in 1979 as a new city district in East Berlin during the course of a GDR new building project. At the time, the building owners attached very little importance to quality and focussed instead on speed. Within a few years, they had erected tens of thousands of prefabricated apartments.
Germany's largest prefabricated high-rise building estate quickly lost its appeal after the German reunification and many residents moved to other districts. Around the turn of the millennium, the municipal housing company Degewo recorded a vacancy rate of roughly 30 percent. The situation was particularly grim in Ahrensfelde, in the north of Marzahn. Even though they had only been built in 1987, the eleven-storey prefabricated buildings were already dilapidated. The Berlin Senate didn’t want to invest any money in their renovation and demolition seemed to be the only solution.
Things didn’t go as planned. The tenants, housing association, and district representatives protested against the demolition. The Urban Planning Office thereupon set up a stakeholder meeting with the Resident Advisory Board, Degewo, and the Senate Department for Urban Development. All of the representatives ultimately agreed on an ambitious goal – the biggest urban redevelopment project in Berlin: Ahrensfelde was to house fewer but better apartments in future.
Sustainable urban development
The creative solution: the prefabricated buildings were not demolished but made smaller. Between 2003 and 2005, 16 eleven-storey high-rise blocks were transformed into buildings with three to six storeys. These differences in height and the rooftop terraces gave the Ahrensfelder terraces their name.
The prefabricated design acquiesced to the deconstruction. The panels were easy to detach, and the cranes removed them. “A bit like Lego”, as one urban researcher team put it. What’s more, the prefabricated design with its industrially manufactured components also made redesigning the interior easier. The old baths, for example, were easy to remove and even the worn building slabs could be crushed and used as road construction material.
The new apartments were equipped with high-quality furnishings: modern and larger kitchens as well as bathrooms, balconies and tenant gardens. Degewo also altered the floor plans. To address the needs of as many different tenant groups as possible, the buildings were given 39 different types of floor plans ranging between 48 and 102 square metres. The 5-room apartments from the GDR times that hardly anybody wanted to rent were converted into smaller units.
Thermal insulation and plastic windows ensured energy efficiency. The contracting authorities allowed 22 prefabricated buildings to be completely removed from between the down-sized buildings. This created free space for spacious green areas.
Flagship project, but not a serial model
In just under two years, 1,689 deteriorated prefabricated living quarters were turned into the 447 apartments that became the Ahrensfelder terraces. Vacancies quickly became a thing of the past. Degewo sold 38 of these apartments to new owners and urban development experts came to Marzahn to study the successful conversion on-site.
The Ahrensfelder terraces are a flagship project for the Marzahn-Hellersdorf district and an example of successful urban development. However, it is not a model that can be transferred to other housing estates. The conversion cost over 30 million euros in total – which is too much to be repeated nationwide.",,,Grand Tour of Berlin Modernism,https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/styles/visitberlin_bleed_header_visitberlin_mobile_1x/private/image/AhrensfelderTerassen_M_050513jr205.b_Foto_Roetzsch__DL_PPT_0.jpg?h=0c2904f9&itok=yVUZ5-a-,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/ahrensfelder-terraces,,,,

Every member of the Academy has made a name for themselves in art. Max Liebermann, Bertolt Brecht and Käthe Kollwitz are all members. Six arts disciplines are represented: art and architecture, music and literature, performing arts, film and media art. Temporary exhibitions, lectures and concerts are held in all disciplines. Writer Arno Schmidt was the focus throughout 2015, and 2016 featured exhibition and talks relating to ""Children in Exile"". You'll find the Akademie der Künste at two locations: the modern glass building directly at the Brandenburg Gate and a complex building from the 1960s on Hanseatenweg.
The Academy: 300 years of tradition
In 1696, elector Friedrich III establishes the Akademie der Künste. As with the examples in Paris and Rome, its ambition is to advise and represent the artist community. Each discipline is associated with the local universities. Changing presidents have led the academy, including Max Liebermann, Günter Grass and Jeanine Meerapfel. National Socialism restricted their liberal values greatly, meaning that members like Käthe Kollwitz needed to escape. Later, the academy is divided into eastern and western sections. Since 1993, the Akademie der Künste has been reunited. Today it is an entity under the law of the Federal Republic. The academy represents Germany in terms of art, promoting its intellectual property and maintaining its cultural heritage.
The head office is located at Pariser Platz, in a modern glass building which opens in 2005, it has bright, open floors, stairs and many glass elements. It is here that most of the exhibitions and events take place. Different disciplines engage visitors with poetry readings, talks, innovative concerts and art performances. The academy's president is in constant discussion with artists about new trajectories in individual fields. This tradition goes back over 200 years. The building on 
Hanseatenweg dates back to the 1960s. Architectural features are grey concrete, red brick, slate tiles and dark pine wood: all of which is in marked contrast to the ease of the new building. Here you will find exhibition spaces and studios for electro-acoustic music. Additionally, there are workshops for young academicians.
Exhibitions nearby
The Bundestag has its own art collection, the Artothek, with changing exhibitions of over 4,000 works including those by Joseph Beuys and Jenny Holzer. The Czech Centre has a gallery which focuses on contemporary art and photography. You can also find the Liebermann House's changing art exhibits at the Brandenburg Gate. The well-known presidents of the Akademie der Künste have lived here. The Daimler Contemporary at Potsdamer Platz focuses on abstraction and minimalism in the 20th century. Thanks to its Renaissance style architecture, Martin-Gropius-Bau is a work of art in itself. Inside, you can expect to see top-notch and internationally significant exhibitions.","Monday	closed

Please note: The current opening and closing hours and special hygiene rules for the Covid-19 are available on the website.
Please note: Due to the current situation you are currently obliged to wear a mask with mouth and nose cover on these streets.
Alexanderplatz in Berlin Mitte is one of the best-known public squares in Berlin – and it’s certainly the biggest. Named after Tsar Alexander I, who visited the Prussian capital in 1805, most people simply call it Alex. 
Alexanderplatz is Berlin’s eastern centre and is an important transport junction – for the S-Bahn, U-Bahn, regional trains, trams and buses. It also has a great many great tourist attractions within walking distance, making it the ideal starting point for a sightseeing tour of Berlin.
Berlin Alexanderplatz in the 19th century 
Up to the 1850s, Alexanderplatz was a military parade and exercise ground, as well as a place where local farmers sold their produce. It became a major transport junction when the railway station opened in 1882.
The construction of the central market hall in 1886 and the Tietz department store between 1904 and 1911 made the square the city’s main shopping centre. It gained literary fame around the world with Alfred Döblin’s 1929 novel Berlin Alexanderplatz.
Alexanderplatz is also popular as a film location. Many scenes of the series Babylon Berlin are set at Alexanderplatz Berlin Germany. In The Bourne Supremacy Bourne meets an agent under the world clock at Alexanderplatz.

Scene of historical events
Alexanderplatz is not only a major transport junction, but also a historic site. There was street fighting in the square during the March Revolution of 1848, and in November 1989 – just before the fall of the Berlin wall – the peaceful demonstrations against the East German regime culminated here.
Did you know that in the 1920s a huge roundabout and skyscrapers were planned on Alexanderplatz?
Alexanderplatz now and in the future
Largely destroyed in the Second World War, Alexanderplatz did not take its current shape until the 1960s. With the square converted to a pedestrian zone, it is surrounded by busy multiple-lane roads. It was during this time that the big department store then known as Centrum was built, along with the adjacent Alex-Passagen, the Weltzeituhr (world clock), the Brunnen der Völkerfreundschaft (Fountain of International Friendship) and the Fernsehturm – East Berlin’s famous television tower. After the square was completed in 1971, it was often the venue for large events such as the celebrations for the 25th anniversary of the GDR.
Since reunification, Alexanderplatz has been in a constant state of change: a shopping centre, a multiplex cinema, a department store, shops, hotels – more and more facilities are being built, yet there are still gaps. There are plans for several high-rise buildings around the square, but whether and in what form this project takes place has not yet been decided. Only one thing’s for certain: Alexanderplatz is still the biggest public square in any city in Germany.
The Weltzeituhr at Alexanderplatz
The Weltzeituhr on Alexanderplatz is a real eye-catcher and at the same time a reminder of GDR times. It was designed in the course of the socialist redesign of Alexanderplatz and was installed in September 1969. After the reunification the clock was restored. Some mistakes were corrected, because some cities were assigned to wrong time zones during GDR times. Since 2015, the World Time Clock has been a listed building and is still a popular meeting place for Berliners and tourists alike.",,,,https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/styles/visitberlin_bleed_header_visitberlin_mobile_1x/private/image/Alexanderplatz_iStock_Robert%20Herhold_DL_PPT_0.jpg?h=2f83cd36&itok=2wGUlaQL,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/alexanderplatz,,,,

A stroll through the district of Dahlem brings you to the erstwhile Outpost Theater where American soldiers once enjoyed films. The former American Sector of post-war Berlin houses the Alliierten-Museum (Allied Museum) which pays homage to the soldiers who were posted here from 1945 until their eventual withdrawal in 1994. This museum houses everything from original documents to large memorabilia such as the British Hastings aircraft, a French military train restaurant car
 and a segment of a British-American Spy Tunnel.
In the American Sector - 1945 to 1994
American troops occupy zones in the districts of Zehlendorf, Tempelhof, Lichterfelde and Dahlem. As time passes, the US Army starts to build a private shopping mall, a cinema (the outpost) and a library. It is in the early '90s, that the idea of an exhibition dedicated to the Western powers in Berlin is born. Chancellor Helmut Kohl opens the museum in 1994, shortly after the withdrawal of the Western allies. It officially opens in 1998 and attracts over 70,000 visitors in three months. The history of the Western Powers is told in two parts. The tour begins at the Outpost Theater. It takes you through the period between 1945 and 1950 where the focus is the Berlin Airlift. Chronological events are communicated through films and computer stations.
The outdoor exhibition space houses larger attractions, for instance, you can see the inside of a British transport aircraft from the time of the airlift, and the dining wagon of a French military train. Take a walk to a section of the Berlin Wall and the first control cabin from Checkpoint Charlie. The Nicholson Commemorative library brings you to the second part of the exhibition: 1951 to 1994. The focus is on everyday objects, original documents, letters, helmets, signs and garments. Among them is the first satellite image of Berlin. A special highlight is the reproduction of an Anglo-American espionage tunnel which was designed to tap Soviet telephone lines.
Did you know that the spy tunnel exhibited in the museum was not found until 2012 by chance?

Look around in peace and quiet in the 14 fully equipped exhibition rooms of the house: They are equipped with furniture, cast-iron stoves and lamps as well as linen sets and monogram embroidery from the Wilhelminian period (1870-1900).

With gentle ticking and strong gong, the floor clocks go here and in the kitchen, next to an original stove of the time, there is even a fridge and many typical kitchen utensils. Watches, music automatons, music boxes and phonographs and gramophones have taken a particular liking to Charlotte, the trained curator. Extensive chandeliers and high wall mirrors recreate the atmosphere of a warm summer evening in the former garden hall. Feel the airy elegance of the so-called ""Good Room"", which leads over an open staircase to the manor park. A stroll through the picturesque estate park with its restored historic paths will inspire you.

And a completely different ambience awaits you in the basement of the house: Here you will find the last remaining Berlin pub from the Scheunenviertel - Charlotte von Mahlsdorf rescues the ""Mulackritze"" when the building was demolished in 1963 and restores it to its original state in the museum's cellar. Feel yourself in the clubroom and the ""whorehouse"" like in the days of Pinselheinrich Zille. At the time of the GDR, people from film, artist and gay circles (East Berlin) meet at Charlotte's house in Mahlsdorf.

Together with the manor park and the museum, the manor house in Mahlsdorf forms a highly worth seeing ensemble in which living and garden culture are combined in exemplary fashion.","Opening hours

Berlin",52.5194665,13.3987445,Museum,2,TRUE,Alte Nationalgalerie (Old National Gallery),Masterpieces from Impressionism to Realism,,,"Marvel at famous works of art and architecture from 19th century Europe with a visit to the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin.
Caspar David Friedrich, Paul Cézanne and Pierre-Auguste Renoir — these are the famous names you will meet in the Alte Nationalgalerie. The museum is part of the Museumsinsel (Museum Island) and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. In the gallery, you will see paintings and sculptures from the 19th century. The building itself looks like an ancient temple - built in the style of Prussian classicism.
From classicism to romanticism on three floors
Stop for a while before heading into the Alte Nationalgalerie. Admire the imposing neoclassicist building. The upper section is framed by pillars, entirely in the style of an ancient temple. The idea comes from King Frederick William IV of Prussia. His ideas influence Berlin's architecture in the 19th century, as it does with the design for the Alte Nationalgalerie - a classicist temple building. Once you enter the museum, you are still surrounded by Prussian classicism. In the entrance and on the first floor, you will find statues and paintings from this period. The floor continues to the detailed works of Adolph Menzel. Continue the tour to the second floor to the Impressionist paintings. Here you will stand in front of famous monuments by Monet, Renoir and Manet. Plan some time to look at famous paintings like Renoir's ""In Summer"". The rooms are spacious, and every work of art is given enough room to be admired fully. On the third floor, you will find works from the Romantic Goethe period. One of the highlights is the hall, completely dedicated to the works of Caspar David Friedrich. Imagine his ""Monk by the Sea"" and let the wide, grey night sky appear to you.
Not only does the museum display works of art, but the building itself has an interesting history. It begins in 1861 with the death of a banker. In his will, the banker in question, Joachim Heinrich William Wagener, bequeaths his collection of paintings the Prussian state to be enjoyed by all lovers of art. Architect Friedrich August Stüler soon begins work on a worthy home for Wagener's artistic treasures. Johann Heinrich Strack then takes over and finally completes the construction. In 1876, the museum opens its doors. However, it does not stay open. In World War II, bombs hit the building. The gallery is renovated, but does not immediately return to its former glory. Germany is now divided, and the exhibits are spread over several locations in the GDR and West Berlin. Only after the reunification of Germany in 1990 do they return to their original location. The city rehabilitates the museum once again in the 1990s. A new edition is the highly praised hall for Caspar David Friedrich. In 2001 the Alte Nationalgalerie re-opens its doors and has remained open until today.
Five famous masterpieces
Adolph Menzel’s paintings ‘The Balcony Room’ (1845) and ‘Iron Rolling Mill’ (1875).
Double Statue of the Princesses Luise and Friederike of Prussia (1795-1797) by Johann Gottfried Schadow.
Bronze equestrian statue of Friedrich Wilhelm IV (1875-1886) sculpted by Alexander Calandrelli. This is located on the staircase in front of the museum.

When you enter the flat, it takes you back in time to the 1950s, when the author lived here with her husband and daughter.
Anna Seghers is most well-known for her novels The Seventh Cross and Transit Visa, which are some of the most important works of the time. She wrote nine long novels, as well as numerous short stories and essays.
Anna Seghers’s apartment
Anna Seghers moved into the flat in 1955 after having returned to Berlin from exile in 1947. As a Jew and a communist, she had been persecuted by the Nazis, who had also burnt her books. In 1933, she fled via Switzerland to France, and later went into exile in Mexico. After returning, she lived in the flat until her death in 1983. Even as president of the East German writers’ association, she did not change anything, and continued to live in this modest apartment.
Anna Seghers particularly loved the balcony – which she called her “crow’s nest” because it felt like being on a ship. She used to like writing there with a view of the trees.
The museum
Since the author’s death, the flat has been run by the Akademie der Künste as a memorial centre, since 2018 as a museum.
The apartment – and all its furnishings – has been left exactly as it was when she lived there. It is simply decorated, with lots of warm wood and souvenirs from her exile in Mexico. It’s as if Anna Seghers has just gone out. Her writing desk with her typewriter and glasses bears witness to her work as an author. The library contains 10,000 volumes.
There is a small exhibition with first editions of her books, photographs and letters, and her voice can be heard on sound recordings. Readings are held in the flat, and the intimate surroundings give them a special atmosphere.","Opening hours

“The world will still keep on turning without me; what is going to happen, will happen, and anyway it’s no good to resist. I’ll just let matters take their course and concentrate on studying and hope that everything will be all right in the end.” Anne Frank wrote this on February 3, 1944, just a few months before her deportation. The sentences are a testament to the fascination and tragedy of this young girl’s story. Her thoughts and hopes are still relevant to young people today. The exhibition All About Anne addresses this in a unique way. It is the only exhibition on the history of Nazi rule in Berlin that is specifically aimed at children, young people and families.
An exhibition with an interactive, hands-on atmosphere
The courtyard at Hackeschen Markt is adorned with colourful street art on all sides. A graffiti artwork of the young Anne Frank looks back at you with a smile. This is where you’ll find the entrance to Berlin’s Anne Frank Zentrum. The idea for the centre was born in 1994 on the 50th anniversary of the liberation from Fascism. At first, the founding association only exhibited a touring exhibition. Then, four years later, a permanent centre opened, as a partner of Anne Frank House in Amsterdam. It has been located not far from Hackescher Markt since 2002.
The All About Anne exhibition, which opened in November 2018, commemorates the life of Anne Frank. It is a place of learning about the history of National Socialism. Anne Frank is one of the most famous victims of the Holocaust. The Jewish girl hid from the Nazis in a secret annex in Amsterdam along with her parents Otto and Edith, her sister Margot and four other people being persecuted by the Nazis. They were discovered after two years. Anne Frank died in 1945 in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp as a result of her imprisonment. After her death, her diary became world famous. Frequently asked questions are answered in the entrance area of the exhibition space and information is also provided about the history of the site and about the work of the Anne Frank Zentrum
The life of Anne Frank
One part of the exhibition is dedicated to the life of Anne Frank. It tells the story of Anne, her family and her friends, as well as her persecution and time in hiding. Six different parts of the museum each show a period of Anne’s life: Anne’s childhood years in Germany (1929-1933), Anne’s new home in the Netherlands (1933-1940), Anne’s life in danger (1940-1942), Anne’s time in hiding (1942-1944), Anne Frank’s last 6 months (1944-1945) and Otto Frank’s return and Anne’s diary (1945-1947). There are several video interviews with contemporary witnesses and tactile objects. Visitors can help shape this exhibition area: There are numerous panels with fascinating detailed information. Visitors can highlight the individual panels that have particular resonance for them.
Past and present
Another part of the exhibition draws connections between Anne Frank’s life and the present day. After all, studying Anne Frank’s biography is a way of coming to terms with the Holocaust, understanding the present and thinking about the future. There are six areas dedicated to this: In the library you can read and write, and familiarise yourself with the diaries of Anne and other people. School groups can perform theatre on the stage and all visitors are invited to watch films or draw and be creative in the workshop. Various forms of remembrance are presented. The archive contains documentation and other research material. You can view reports of anti-Semitic incidents and do further research at the computer stations. You can also add your own thoughts to Anne's chestnut tree.

Jewish history in the surrounding area
Directly opposite the Anne Frank Zentrum you will find the Museum Blindenwerkstatt Otto Weidt. The small manufacturing company Weidt once employed Jews here at its Workshop for the Blind, protecting them from persecution. The Old Jewish Cemetery is also marked by the Nazi era. In 1943, the Gestapo destroyed it, and it was not until 2008 that the Jewish community finally reopened it. The New Synagogue foundation houses the Open The Gates exhibition. It displays remains of the old synagogue and other exhibits of Jewish life in Berlin. The monument to the Women’s Protest of 1943, located in Rosenstraße, draws attention to the successful protests of non-Jewish women against the imprisonment of their Jewish husbands. The Neue Wache (New Guardhouse) memorial commemorates the victims of tyranny and war. The Mother with Dead Son sculpture by Käthe Kollwitz has been part of the memorial since its redesign in 1993.","Tuesday10:00 – 18:00

For their planned residential house at Obersee in the district of Weißensee, the clients attracted one of the most prominent architects of New Objectivity: Ludwig Mies van der Rohe.

Lemke House ranks as one of his important contributions to Berlin Modernist architecture, alongside the Neue Nationalgalerie, which emerged more than 30 years later.

The couple requested a cost-effective design. The construction costs later amounted to 16,000 marks, which is equivalent to 61,000 euros today.

Despite the tight budget, the architect succeeded in creating a timelessly beautiful building that picked up on the key features of modern Bauhaus architecture.

Simple beauty

The overall appearance of the house is understated yet elegant. With its flat roof and clear forms, it stands out clearly from the neighbouring residential buildings.

Mies van der Rohe used contrast in his choice of materials: large glass surfaces were followed by reddish brown clinker brick walls. Transparency alternates with opaque, solid brickwork and creates exciting tension. In his architecture he followed the guiding principle of ""less is more"". For Mies van der Rohe, reduction and simplicity were the means to let the forms and materials speak for themselves.

Mies van der Rohe designed not only the house, but also a great deal of the furniture for the couple. Together with his spouse and work partner at the time, the designer Lilly Reich, the architect made cupboards, chairs, armchairs and beds – with each room featuring furniture made out of a different type of wood. Today the furniture can be found in the collection of the Museum of Decorative Arts at the Kulturforum.

Smooth transition

Haus Lemke was built according to an L-shaped floor plan. Between the two parts of the building there is a terrace paved with sandstone. This corresponds to the structure of a courtyard house. Mies van der Rohe worked on this type of house design in the 1930s, and in Hohenschönhausen he implemented it for the first time.

The courtyard serves as an extended living space, a transition from the inside to the outside. There are no steps, just as in Mies van der Rohe's design for the Villa Tugendhat in Brno.

The architect also incorporated the surrounding environment to a greater extent. Mies van der Rohe's garden concept perfectly complements the residential idyll with a view over the park landscape around Obersee.

Post-war fate and after reunification

The Lemke couple bought the house in 1933. Martha and Karl Lemke lived there for only about twelve years, as they had to surrender it to the Red Army in 1945.

What followed was a period of misuse as both a garage and storage area. In 1962 the house came into the possession of the GDR Ministry for State Security, first as a residential building, later as a farm building. Despite its inclusion in the monument register in 1977, the building's structure deteriorated and funds were lacking for professional repairs.

Since 1990, the building has been under municipal ownership under the name Mies van der Rohe Haus, and it was restored to its original condition in 2002.condition,. These days, four to six art and architecture exhibitions are held each year and on every first Sunday of the month at 11.30 am the Understanding Mies guided tour takes place (5 euros per person).

Our tips for nearby the Mies van der Rohe Haus

After your visit to the Mies van der Rohe Haus you can take a walk around the Obersee. Or discover architectural history in the Alt-Hohenschönhausen neighbourhood: here, prefabricated buildings from the 1970s meet the elegance of the villa district at Orankesee. And houses from the 1920s form a striking contrast to former tenements. The tranquil area has meanwhile been transformed into a lively neighbourhood, yet you can still feel the charm of bygone days on a walk past manor houses and the Tabor Church. Our Berlin app Going Local tells you more about Berlin's neighbourhoods.

Bernau-Waldfrieden",52.70597,13.54386,Architecture,2,FALSE,Bundesschule des Allgemeinen Deutschen Gewerkschaftsbundes (ADGB),"Progress in stone, steel, and glass",,,"The Bauhaus was the most important school of design, architecture, and art in the 20th century. Nearly 100 years ago, the designers, architects, and visionaries of the Bauhaus created powerful ideas that have had a lasting impact around the world.
The Bauhaus Ideal
The school in Bernau was completed in 1930 for the General German Trade Union Confederation with the substantial contribution of Hannes Meyer, then director of the Bauhaus, and Hans Wittwer, then master of the construction department and head of the construction office at the Bauhaus, as well as students and the workshops at Dessau-based Bauhaus. They created an exemplary design for a facility with clear lines set in a natural landscape on the edge of Berlin.

Award-Winning World Heritage
The building complex has been a protected monument since 1977 and was just named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in July 2017, joining other Bauhaus UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Dessau and Weimar. The school has now almost been completely restored in its original state. The restored Bundesschule was awarded the Brandenburg Architecture Prize in 2007 and baudenkmal bundesschule bernau e. V. was awarded the Brandenburg Built Culture/Initiative Prize in 2015 for its efforts to save the Bundesschule.

Unique Architectural Aspects
Nine components now form the historic complex: the entrance, the auditorium, the dining hall, a glass corridor, boarding houses, a sports hall, seminar rooms, teachers’ houses, and the library. While the entrance and some other parts of the ensemble were significantly modified in the 1950s, most parts of the building were restored in 2001-2007 to the original colour scheme and visual language that the Bauhaus is famous for. Especially impressive is the faithfully restored dining hall with its graceful, ribbed concrete design and the giant chandeliers made of hundreds of glass blocks. The glass corridor is once again flooded with light and serves as the dominant axis of the building and as a place of communication. Classically Bauhaus: the stairwells in the different boarding houses have been given different colour schemes. The way the rooms are divided, the refined lighting scheme, and the way the bathrooms, social spaces, and communication areas are designed reflect the progressive and democratic teaching and learning traditions of the Bauhaus. The rooms near the artificial pond and outdoor swimming pool open out onto views of this open space. The sports hall can even be almost completely opened on one side.

The History of the Bundesschule
Weimar Republic
When the ADGB Bundesschule opened in 1930 as the first central training centre for the trade unions and the ADGB, it offered space for 120 participants. Courses for youth leaders, women, works councils, labour dispute judges, etc. were offered. In the few years before Adolf Hitler was elected chancellor, more than 4,000 trade unionists took courses here, 15-20% of whom were women. The teachers taught basic knowledge on social policy, economic policy, and labour law, while representatives of the respective associations provided information about organisational and trade-specific problems, history, and current political issues. The school also offered “practical exercises”, “written work”, and “sport and body care”. Obligatory cultural events usually followed in the evening hours. With this concept, the school stands in the tradition of trade union education as practised in Germany since the beginning of the 20th century.

Nazi Era
On 2 May 1933, the Berlin wing of the SA (Storm Troopers) occupied the Bundesschule. The students were forced to leave. On 16 June 1933, the school was converted into the Reichsführerschule (Reich Leadership School) of the Nazi Party and the German Labor Front (DAF) and was personally inaugurated by Adolf Hitler. This was where the top officials of the Nazi Party, the DAF, and the NSBO (the Nazi successor to the trade unions) were trained. Well-known Nazi representatives like Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, ideologue Alfred Rosenberg, editor of the anti-Semitic weekly newspaper Der Stürmer Julius Streicher, and DAF head Robert Ley held lectures here. The instruction had a military flavour. A shooting range and war games facilities were built on the school grounds. Between 1941 and 1943, the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA) met here to consult on racial policy, deportation, and resettlement policies.

Postwar and GDR
After the end of the Second World War, the Soviet Military Administration and the Red Army used the site as a hospital and military accommodation. But the newly founded Free German Federation of Trade Unions (FDGB) asserted its claim to the facility by the end of 1945. It was returned the following year and opened in 1947 as the Theodord Leipart FDGB Bundesschule, rechristened in 1952 the Fritz Heckert Trade Union School. The training offered here now offered a diploma. Professors and institutes were set up for such subjects as political economics, business administration, social policy, labour law, history of the German and international labour movement, and the philosophy and cultural policy of the trade unions in the East.

Post-Communist Era
When the FDGB was dissolved along with the rest of East German institutions in 1990, the school was also closed and all its employees dismissed. The ownership and future use of the listed building and its campus would remain uncertain until 2001 when the Berlin Trades Chamber became the new owner entitled to use the site. Today, the buildings of the former Bundesschule serve as a hotel hosting courses and training workshops for the Chamber. Both the historic and in newly built buildings are home to the BarnimWissensZentrum. It offers free, qualified professional training in state-recognised professions in business, administration, and social services.

A view of lakes and forests, of palaces and parks, of all of “Prussian Arcadia” in its consummate beauty.

History of the Belvedere

Friedrich Wilhelm IV, known as the “romanticist on the throne”, loved the view of the landscape and the palaces so much that in 1847 he had a romantic belvedere palace built – with indisputably the most beautiful view of Potsdam and the Havel lakes all the way to Berlin. Sadly, he did not live to see it completed in in 1863.

Based on Friedrich Wilhelm’s plans, the architects Ludwig Persius, Friedrich August Stüler and Ludwig Ferdinand Hesse built it in the style of an Italian Renaissance villa. Its arcades, colonnades, galleries, courtyard pool and two viewing towers create a romantic atmosphere. The grounds were planned by the renowned landscape architect Peter Joseph Lenné. However, construction was halted due to lack of funds. In the end, only a part of what was originally planned was completed.

After the Second World War, the site was a prohibited zone, not only because Soviet officers lived in the villas nearby, but also because it gave a clear view of the Berlin Wall and the barrier constructions between Potsdam and West Berlin, which was precisely what the East German authorities did not want.mThus, the Belvedere fell into neglect and obscurity, and no-one could enjoy the beautiful view. Not until reunification and extensive renovation was it restored to its former glory.

Tip: the Pomona Temple on the Pfingstberg

Just below the Belvedere on the Pfingstberg is the Pomona Temple, a little gem that you absolutely have to see. This pavilion is the first building ever to be designed by the great Karl Friedrich Schinkel. The pastel-coloured tea house is built in the Classical style and has a terrace with an awning on the roof. The temple became dilapidated after the war, but after extensive restoration, its old splendour has been restored.  

UNESCO world heritage site

The Belvedere and the Pomona Temple on the Pfingstberg belong to the designated UNESCO world heritage site known as the Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin.

Other ones include:


	Schloss Sanssouci
	The Neues Palais

The Berlin Story is located in a bunker at Anhalter Station. A compact site, the museum has been designed to take you on a journey through 800 years of Berlin life with 30 different displays. Some of the multimedia displays include large scale photographs, short films, sculpture and other art installations. Follow the guided tour through history from the time of Frederick the Great in the 18th century through the German Empire under Bismarck until the late 20th century and the fall of the 
Berlin Wall. Each area has a different scene from history such as the home of a poor family from 1880, complete with original wooden floors, oil lamp lighting and a bean-snapping machine. Another scene tells the story of the lives of the so-called Trümmerfrauen, women who cleaned up Berlin's rubble after the Second World War bombings.
The history of Berlin in an air raid shelter
One of the striking aspects of the Berlin Story is its location: a huge concrete bunker built during the First World War. At that time, the bunker is linked by many corridors to the Anhalter Railway Station. Thousands of Berlin residents seek refuge there during air raids. Over time, the slogan He who builds the bunker drops the bombs is painted in graffiti on the walls, a saying which has become a hallmark of the museum. Both the nature of the material and the subterranean location adds to the atmosphere of the museum. As you start your Berlin Story Museum visit, you are led to the lower floor, collecting your audio guide as you go. The next stop is The Gate which tells the story of the Brandenburg Gate through large photo panels. Then it's onto, among other things, 20th century section with book burning by the Nazi party in the 1930s. The GDR section includes the Palace of the Republic's impressive porcelain service. A visit to the Berlin Story gives a taste of what is available in greater detail in many other museums in the city.

In the same bunker you can visit an exhibition about Hitler. How could it happen that so many voted for Hitler? How did he become a Nazi? How did he get to power? How did anti-Semitism lead to concentration camps and the Holocaust? Why did generals and soldiers participated until the very end? With the suicide of the dictator Hitler actually ended the bloody war of history.

Berlin",52.5460018,13.3479864,Museum,2,TRUE,Anti-War-Museum,A plea against violence,,,"Speaking out against violence and war, the Anti-War Museum is established in Berlin at the beginning of the 1920s. The National Socialists close the establishment in 1933. A second attempt to revive the project fails during the war, with the Anti-War Museum (then in Brussels) burned down during the German Western campaign. Almost 40 years later, the Anti-War Museum is re-established. This time it remains: as a plea against war, revealing to you old air-raid shelters, war toys, meaningful photos and documents. It reveals war's tragic history.
Small exhibition with important exhibits
The idea for an anti-war museum in Berlin came from Ernst Friedrich, from Wrocław. In 1925, he founds it at Alexanderplatz in Berlin. Tragically, the National Socialists close it and arrest Friedrich for a time. A place that stands against violence, suffers violence. The SA turn it into a torture chamber, a so-called ""storm restaurant."" Friedrich's grandson Tommy Spree re-opens the Anti-War Museum in Berlin in 1982. It is a small museum in a classic Berlin building, typical of the former working-class district, Wedding. Many exhibits are deliberately oppressive: soldiers' helmets, warfare agents and gas masks fill the display cabinets. The air-raid shelter looks realistic, with a rusty bed frame made during war days. Inscriptions on a historic bunk door from the borough of Neukölln testify to the hours that people spent here during the bomb attacks. To keep calm, a woman writes on the metal the date and time of almost every air-raid alarm. The Second World War is not the only focus – the Anti-War Museum displays photographs of casualties from the First World War, to emphasise the horror. A world map indicates all current war zones. The art displayed in the Anti-War Museum is also a protest against violence: photographs, writings and paintings are characterized by their abstract as well as direct appeals for pacifism. Artists include Karl Kraus, Evelyn Sion and Kurt Tucholsky.
Features of the Anti-War Museum:
original bomb shelter in the basement
bunker door from Neukölln with dates and times of each air raid
peace sculpture ""The Broken Rifle"", in front of the museum
Peace Gallery with anti-war art (changing)
war toys from the 20th century
War memorials in Berlin
Resistance fighters and victims of the Second World War are commemorated on a memorial stone in the Dorotheenstadt Cemetery. The plain and simple monument includes the names of several notable figures. Another memorial site stands today at the former Plötzensee prison: the National Socialist regime formerly locks up and executes its political opponents here. The site reminds us, for example, of those involved in the Hitler assassination attempt of July 20, 1944. Murellenberg commemorates the victims of the NS-Justiz. In 1945, more than 200 soldiers are killed, accused of desertion. 106 traffic mirrors serve as memorial markers, some bearing inscriptions by the artist Patricia Pisani. The German-Russian Museum, on the other hand, can be found in the place where German military power capitulates on May 8, 1945. The gallery CHAUSSEE 36 is situated in a former Prussian officer's house and exhibits photography. There is also a restored air-raid shelter.","Monday16:00 – 20:00

Probably the most important witness to the medieval twin cities of Berlin and Cölln, the remains of the ancient city wall from the 13th century can be found between the Amtsgericht Mitte, the Parochialkirche and the historic restaurant ""Zur letzten Instanz"".
City Wall as a Building Material
If you walk along Littenstraße, you'll soon come upon the striking reddish-brown walls made of lime mortar, field stones and bricks, added to and restored over the centuries. About 120 metres of the former 2.5 km city wall remain, partially disguised as the rear walls of houses, a fact that became clear when the wartime ruins were being cleared in 1948.
From City Wall to Excise Wall
By the 18th century, the city wall no longer served to mark the city limits of Berlin. Another wall was built around the growing city to serve as an excise tax wall to levy tariffs on goods entering and leaving the city. You may have noticed that many of Berlin's stations and squares have the word ""Tor"" (""gate"") in their name, such as Hallesches Tor and Schlesisches Tor. These names are reminders of the old city gates in the customs wall which originally stood near the stations. Between 1867 and 1870, the excise wall and most of the city gates were torn down. Only three were left standing at the time and two of those were destroyed in the Second World War. The only gate from this wall that still stands is the Brandenburg Gate, once on the western edge of the city. The gate also includes the buildings that were once used to collect the customs duties and excise taxes. Remains of the excise wall can be found next to the Brandenburg Gate and at Hanoversche Straße 9. After unearthing the foundations of the excise wall in the 1980s, a portion of the wall was reconstructed in 1987 along Stresemannstraße.

Throughout the year, Unterwelten-Museum gives seminars and numerous tours and exhibitions offering vivid insights into the work up close. Various guided tours focus on the civilian air raid during the Second World War. On tours through the underground, you also encounter special historic features such as East Germany escape tunnels, ammunition findings and archaeological treasures. The Berliner Unterwelten guides reveal exciting and moving insights. Also recommended is the industrial monument Fichtebunker in Berlin-Kreuzberg. It unites 130 years of city history - from the gasometer for the city street lighting to the use as a mother and child bunker, from buildings converted during the Nazi era to the camp for Senate reserves for West Berliners at the time of the Berlin Wall. The extraordinary exhibition of ""Myth of Germania"" examines the Nazis' plans for the intended imperial capital of Berlin.

Architecture
Berlin Central Station is one of the most spectacular architectural projects of the capital. After undergoing eleven years of construction, the station formerly known as the Lehrter Stadtbahnhof was reopened on 28 May 2006 as the largest and most modern connecting station in Europe. There are two main levels for train traffic and three connection and business levels. However, it is interesting to note that the concept of a ""cathedral of transport"" was not quite able to be realised in accordance with the wishes of the architect Meinhard von Gerkan. For example, he had planned on having a vaulted roof but this had to give way to a flat roof. Furthermore, the glass roof above the upper rail system had to be reduced significantly. Nevertheless, the station is delicate, spacious and full of light. The 321 metre long glass hall for rails running east to west is crossed by the 160 metre long and 40 metre wide concourse where rails are running north to south. A sophisticated system of large openings in the ceilings at all levels allows for natural light to be let in so that it can even reach the lower tracks. The architecture places an emphasis on the character of the station as a traffic intersection. For the Hamburg-based architects Gerkan, Marg & Partner, the importance of the new Berlin Central Station consists in the fact that it serves as an interface in Europe and this point is the determining factor of their design.",,,"Government district

Over the next few years, a meeting place of social openness, religious tolerance and freedom will grow - on the foundations of Berlin in the heart of Berlin.",,,"Petriplatz – centre of the medieval city
Petriplatz is one of Berlin's oldest squares and the centre of Berlin's older sister city Cölln, which was mentioned in a document as early as 1237 - seven years earlier than Berlin. 1307 Berlin-Cölln emerged from the cities on both sides of the Spree. At the central Petriplatz there was among other things the Cöllnische town hall and a Latin school. During the Second World War, the square was heavily destroyed and almost completely disappeared in the 1960s as a result of socialist rebuilding. Scientific excavations began on Petriplatz in 2007. Archaeologists found the remains of the Petri church and its various construction phases here. The first church building dates from the 13th century, the last church building was blown up in 1964.
Different perspectives coming together in a common place
A unique building is now being erected over the foundations of the 800-year-old Petrikirche: The House of One. On 14 April 2020, the foundation stone will be laid for a sacred building planned by Jews, Christians and Muslims as a common new church - for a dialogue of religions, but also as a forum in which the most diverse world views meet and are discussed.
The project did not originate under the aegis of large institutions, associations or central councils, but was initiated solely by three small communities of the three faith communities. From the beginning it convinced and received large donations from the Federation and the State, but also from a large number of private donors.
And even if the house will not be built until 2022/23 - it already has international appeal: The House of One Foundation has already started its work and is initiating events and cooperations with partner projects all over the world. It is impossible to imagine interreligious conferences without it, the work with children and young people is continuously being expanded.
In 2012, Berlin architectural firm Kuehn Malvezzi won the international competition for the inter-faith house of prayer and study. Their concept is to build a modern structure on the footprint of the most recent Petrikirche. This will house the church, synagogue and mosque, the latter two facing east. For common dialogue, there will be a central space for meeting and learning under the high dome of the structure. Underneath, the archaeological finds from the earliest days of Berlin's history will be open to the public. A library and a meeting space will serve as space for scientific work and teaching. The lobby and the ""crowning"" city loggia with its magnificent views will make the connection to the city.
A house for all
In 2012, the Berlin architecture firm KuehnMalvezzi won the international architecture competition, and its innovative design has attracted the attention of the professional public at exhibitions in Chicago, London and Stockholm in recent years. The future architecture combines a synagogue, a church and a mosque under one roof. The one at its centre will be a bright, high space of community and discussion, crowned by a central dome. In the foundation levels of the building, the history of Berlin can be experienced through archaeological windows.
Anyone interested in the archaeology of Petriplatz will be comprehensively informed from 2022 at the latest: Right next to the future House of One, an archaeological visitor centre will be erected above the foundations of an old Latin school, which will also provide important insights into the major excavations on the Molkenmarkt in the coming years and other archaeological research.

Although easy to reach, the small Bethlehemkirchplatz can easily be overlooked on the city map by visitors of Berlin. The place is being situated west of the subway stations “Stadtmitte” and “Kochstraße” (U6) in between “Check-Point Charlie” and the “Museum for Communication”. Where deterrent border fortifications could be found until the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, the foundations of the “Bethlehemskirche” (Bohemian Bethlehem Church) were excavated. The church, being inaugurated in 1737, was built as a homestead for bohemian refuges and other foreigners. Today, a mosaic in the pavement of the Bethlehemkirchplatz shows the ground plan of the former church. In the meantime, a sculpture called “Houseball” was added which symbolizes all the household goods that a refugee might be able to carry. At the turn of the millennium, the square was renamed to „Bethlehemkirchplatz“. A downsized advertising pillar contains explanations in German, English and Czech language. It was this impressive square that inspired the conceptual artist Juan Garaizabal.
Memorias Urbanas
In the context of his global art project “Memorias Urbanas”, directed to the recreation of important buildings that vanished in the course of time, he designed an illuminated sculpture made from steel and light elements showing the exact site and size of the original Bohemian Bethlehem Church. The arts at Bethlehemkirchplatz opens up the view to a philanthropic culture which is characterized by its openness with respect to all unknown and which is able to overcome each and every border of inhumanity.

The Documentation Centre in Niederschöneweide is on the site of a former Nazi camp for forced labour, one of more than 3,000 similar camps which once stood in the Berlin area. Entering the exhibition spaces, you will find inscriptions on the walls, letters and biographies which all provide a very personal insight into the prisoners' lives. Down in the air-raid shelter behind the thick walls, you have a chance to learn about the daily lives of the people detained in the camp.
Tour of the barracks
During the National Socialist era, up to 13 million people were imprisoned in the labour camps of the Third Reich. These people came from many countries including Belgium, Italy and the Soviet Union. Only one of the 3,000 camps in the Berlin area still exists today - as the Dokumentationszentrum NS-Zwangsarbeit in the Schöneweide area of the city - to provide an important link to the past. In 2006, the camp opens to the public under the direction of the Topography of Terror Foundation. In 2010, guided tours of the best-preserved of the camp's buildings, Barrack 13, begin. Barrack 13 also has an intact air-raid shelter with inscriptions scrawled on the walls by Italian prisoners of war.
Barrack 2 contains information about the everyday lives of people in the forced labour camp. Biographies, photographs and written documents bring their destiny into sharp focus and gives a true impression of their harsh living and working conditions.The story is one of fear and oppression, but also of freedom and the will to live. The permanent exhibition called ""Caught Between Two Worlds"" is housed in Barrack 4. This tells the story of the 650,000 Italians deported to Germany during the Nazi regime. One of the most striking exhibits is the pocket calendar of Italian Capitan Mario Zipolini, which details his arrest in France. Work your way clockwise round six different thematic areas, a tour which will take around an hour and which takes you out into the surrounding streets and to the banks of the river. Touchscreens are available to help visitors access audio and video clips.

Since 2006, the exhibition has told the story through its displays of well-preserved photographs, documents, personal letters and other artefacts that illustrate the way the workers lived.

Feel and understand: life in hiding
An important producer of brooms and brushes, many of which were destined for the armed forces, Otto Weidt manages to protect a number of his staff from deportation during the Second World War. By obtaining false papers and supplying the workers with food and shelter, he even bribes members of the Gestapo. Today, in the Spandau suburb, the workshop remains almost as it was, with simple wooden floors and workshops fitted with original equipment. Black and white photographs depict scenes of the production, and a picture of Otto Weidt himself hangs on the wall. Letters, poems and postcards of the workers speak of the fear and desperation the people felt, but thank you cards are there as well. They are for food parcels which he sends to the Czech ghetto and concentration camp of Theresienstadt, where some of his former workers are interned. Despite his efforts, some of Weidt’s workers are imprisoned, but the lucky ones manage to hide in a small, windowless room in the furthest corner of the building, the entrance hidden by a clothes cabinet. On the walls are framed photographs of people who have hidden in the Weidt workshop.

The Jewish cemetery and the abandoned space
A short walk west from the museum takes you to the second oldest Jewish cemetery in Berlin, Friedhof Große Hamburger Straße. In 1671, a group of Jews come to Berlin from Vienna under the special protection of the Elector Friedrich Wilhelm. They settle in nearby Spandauer Tor (Spandau Gate), and here they build their cemetery a year after their arrival. In 1943, the Gestapo orders the cemetery to be destroyed. The graves are desecrated and the cemetery is used as an air raid shelter, with the gravestones being used to reinforce the walls. In 1945, the area is put to its original purpose once again, as the authorities bury masses of civilians and soldiers killed during the Allied raids. In the 1970s, the GDR authorities turn the area into a park.
Philosopher, Moses Mendelssohn is buried here in 1786, and today you’ll find a symbolic tombstone in his name. Preserved gravestones are finally reinstalled in 2008. North of the cemetery, on Koppenplatz, you’ll find a memorial commemorating the Holocaust. Karl Biedermann’s bronze sculpture entitled the Deserted Room depicts a table and two chairs, one of which is overturned. A poem by Nelly Sachs accompanies the piece.

General information on the Museum Blindenwerkstatt Otto Weidt
Take the U8 underground line to Weinmeisterstraße, or take the trains S5, S7 or S75 to Hackescher Markt. Both destinations will take you within a couple of minutes’ walk of the museum.

You will enter the museum in style, by crossing the stone Monbijoubrücke (Monbijou Bridge). With its majestic-looking dome, the neo-baroque building immediately catches your eye. The Museum brings together works from different eras: you can visit the Sculpture Gallery, the Museum of Byzantine Art and the coin collection as part of your voyage of discovery.
Magnificent rooms through the centuries
The ground floor of the Bode-Museum consists of five courtyards and a long central axis with magnificent halls. On entering the filigree-decorated dome, you will see the striking equestrian statue of Friedrich Wilhelm von Brandenburg. In another hall, you find yourself surrounded by an Italian Renaissance Basilica. Here, among the sacred art on display, a Florentine resurrection altar is a highlight. Don’t miss the sculptures of Venus and Mercury, located in the small hall within the dome, created for the French King in 1745 by the sculptor Jean-Baptiste Pigalle. On the two upper floors, you can explore the main exhibition. Here, marble-floored rooms are framed with elegant, panelled ceilings. The walls are adorned with large-format paintings and sculptures by artists such as Donatello and Tilman Riemenschneider. Among the Byzantine collection, art from the 3rd to the 15th centuries is on display, as well as antique sarcophagi, ivory carvings and mosaic icons.
The Münzkabinette (Coin Galleries) include half a million coins and medals, making it one of the largest collections of its kind. Explore the Roman, Greek and Oriental works to discover tales from the past. The Tiepolo Gallery is of particular interest: the pink room is lavishly decorated with artful stucco by the Italian Baroque painter Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, who produces 22 frescoes in 1759. The history of the Bode Museum itself begins in 1871: the Imperial Prussian court wishes to set up an art museum. The concept itself comes from the art historian Wilhelm von Bode. In 1904, the museum opens as the ""Kaiser Friedrich Museum"" to honour Friedrich III. The first collections include sculptures and paintings owned by the Prince-elector of Brandenburg. 52 years later, the GDR Minister of Culture renames the site the ""Bode Museum."" From 2000 to 2005, extensive restorations are made to modernise and improve the museum.

Discover the fascinating world of plants at Berlin’s Botanic Garden!,,,"In 1889, Adolf Engler, the first director of the modern Botanic Garden in Berlin, set out to create “the world in a garden”. Today, you can enjoy his remarkable achievement – a rich diversity of plants, from herbaceous and medicinal plants to roses, aquatic and marsh plants, an arboretum including American trees, an Italian garden, an impressive art nouveau Tropical Greenhouse, and much, much more. The Botanic Garden in Berlin is one of the world’s leading gardens, with a collection of 20,000 plant species flowering on site – a magnet attracting around half a million visitors every year.
Berlin’s Botanic Garden – from Arboretum to Tropical Greenhouse
The Botanic Garden offers 43 hectares for guests to stroll and explore. Laid out between by 1897 and 1910 by architect Alfred Koerner, the garden comprises three sections: the Arboretum (woody plants and rose collection), plant formations from similar geographical regions from around the world, and a section dedicated to systematic botany comprising around 1500 plant species.
The landmark Tropical Greenhouse offers a magnificent example of late nineteenth-century art nouveau design in glass and steel. Twenty-five metres high and set on the eastern edge of the garden, it towers over another 14 display greenhouses placed around it.
The Botanic Garden is not only a popular attraction in summer. In winter too, visitors can take the Seasonal Trails to explore the plants of Africa, Australia, East Asia, the tropics and the Mediterranean basin. Incidentally, as in the majority of Botanic Gardens, no dogs are allowed except for registered disability assistance dogs.
The Victoriahaus
One of the jewels in the Botanical Garden is the over 100-year-old Viktoriahaus greenhouse. The romantic greenhouse is named after the giant water lily Victoria, and the glass pavilion is also home to tropical marsh and water plants.
The Victoriahaus is currently closed due to extensive renovations. It opens in summer with a big exhibition from 16 June to 25 August.
Botanical Museum
Berlin’s Botanic Garden is also home to a museum dedicated solely to botany – the only museum of its kind in central Europe. Since 1906, the Botanical Museum has housed the former royal collection of plants. This collection has been steadily expanded and includes a stunning range of models revealing plant structures normally invisible to the human eye – and an entire forest in a shoe box! You can even find out which plants were offered as funerary goods in the tombs of the Egyptian Pharaohs.
Events in the Botanic Garden – Concerts, Perennials Market and Tropical Nights
When the weather turns really cold in January, the Botanic Garden opens its doors to celebrate its Tropical Nights. On Friday and Saturday evenings, visitors can escape winter to enjoy music and cocktails under the palm trees in the Tropical Greenhouse. The Botanic Garden offers a wealth of concerts and markets through the year – with summer concerts, the Botanical Nights, the Berlin Perennials Market and the Orchid Show heading the popularity rankings for visitors.
The range of tours available on many days of the year also offers a chance to gain a deeper insight into the gardens and their rich variety of plants. The highlight or themed tours, all with experienced guides, are also offered in English for the garden and the museum – and due to their popularity, it’s well worth booking in advance (more details at http://www.bgbm.org/en/guided-tours).
Dahlem – the village
If you haven’t seen enough plants already, directly next to the Botanical Garden on Altensteinstraße is the Königliche Gartenakademie, a gardening school with a pleasant café in the greenhouse. The centre of the district, Dahlem-Dorf, is also very nice – take a stroll along it. On Königin-Luise-Straße the busy city seems very far away. In the Luise beer garden, students from the FU Berlin sit under shady trees discussing their recent lectures.
It’s much busier when the Domäne Dahlem hosts mediaeval festivals or the Christmas market. The former manor house is now an agricultural open-air museum with a farm shop. Not far away is the Dahlem museum complex.","Museum & Greenhouses:

Displaying decorative excellence across three floors
On the website for the Bröhan-Museum, founder Karl Bröhan states, 'I noticed that there was a scarcely known treasure in the years around 1900 that was only waiting to be unearthed.' This helps to explain the profound commitment Bröhan has in uniting art deco and art nouveau. On his 60th birthday, he donates his whole collection to the city of Berlin.The Bröhan-Museum is housed in a barracks building belonging to the Charlottenburg Palace complex since 1983. The three floors of the museum are carefully arranged with complementary designs and matching styles. The displays show each piece of unique design in its functioning form, with decorative extras such as the glasswork of Gallé to highlight functionality. Displays are assembled to give the impression of an entire room arrangement. Mother-of-pearl coloured upholstery chairs stand next to tables made of rosewood. Silverware, floral ornaments, and period lamps are found in the rooms. The ground floor, where your tour begins, is focused on art nouveau. Paintings by Hector Guimard and Eugène Gaillard hang above porcelain from the Royal Porcelain Factory, Berlin.
There are also Nancy school vases: French works of art that come together like a field of flowers made of glass. Art deco and functionalist artworks are found throughout the upper floors. There are also more of the curved, playful forms of art nouveau and the straight lines and abstract forms of modernism. Silver and metal art deco objects exude elegance, such as the coffee set by Jean Puiforcat. See striking early works of functionalism, including ceramics by the Deutscher Werkbund and furniture by Gerrit Rietveld.

The Charlottenburg Palace ensemble is home to a number of museums, all a short distance from the Bröhan-Museum. Originally a summer residence for Friedrich I, the palace is the largest and most magnificent in Berlin and contains a vast art collection. The Berggruen Museum, next to the Bröhan-Museum, contains a collection from the art dealer Heinz Berggruen. It is chiefly devoted to classical modernist art. A highlight of the collection is the 'Lying Nude' by Picasso dating back to 1942. Directly opposite from the Bröhan-Museum is the Scharf-Gerstenberg collection boasting world-famous artworks by surrealists including Goya, Max Ernst, and Dalí. Occupying the Villa Oppenheim, the Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf Museum looks at the history of the city and the sister districts of Charlottenburg and Wilmersdorf, united since 2001. For something a little different, visit the Gipsformerei on Sophie-Charlotte Straße, a plaster-moulding workshop. Take home your very own piece of art or a plaster replica of one of the Berlin museums' most famous residents, Nefertiti.

The Gedächtniskirche (Memorial Church) is the most famous landmark in the western city centre and is one of Berlin’s most important churches – but at the same time much more than just that. It is composed of the ruins of the church that was destroyed in the war, as well a modern church building. It is a memorial for peace and reconciliation, commemorates Berliners’ determination to rebuild after the war, and is a place of contemplation.
The history of the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church
In honour of Wilhelm I, the first German Kaiser, his grandson Wilhelm II planned a magnificent church, which was built by Franz Schwechten between 1891 and 1895 in the Neo-Romantic style. With five spires, the bombastic design reflected the tastes of the time and that of the Kaiser.
The church bells were the second biggest in Germany after Cologne, and when the church was inaugurated, the five bells rang so loudly that the wolves in the zoo started howling. During the Second World War, the chimes stopped and the five bells were melted down for munitions.
Reconstruction
Air raids in 1943 damaged the church so badly that the top of the main spire broke off and the roof collapsed. At the end of the war, the Allies were unwilling to rebuild it, since it had been a symbol of excessive national pride. The ruin stood as a constant reminder to Berliners of the horrors of war. In 1956, plans to completely demolish the church and build a new one led to angry public protests. As a compromise, the architect Egon Eiermann integrated the ruin in his design for the new church. The present church was completed between 1959 and 1961. The design consists of concrete honeycomb elements with stained glass inlays. Inside the octagonal nave, the stained glass produces a rich blue light and an atmosphere of meditative calm. The memorial hall in the old spire is now a memorial against war and destruction and a symbol of reconciliation. It also contains a crucifix made of nails from the burnt roof timbers of Coventry Cathedral, which was almost completely destroyed by bombs in 1940. The crosses of nails from Coventry, which are also in Dresden, Hiroshima and Volgograd, are a symbol of reconciliation.

Renovation of the church
The church has been undergoing extensive renovation for several years. From 2009 to 2015 the old spire was hidden under thick tarpaulins. The new spire and chapel are next in line.

Gain a real understanding of the politician in the Willy Brandt Forum's permanent exhibition. This modern museum gives an insight into his professional life and unconventional political style. Delve into the political history of West Germany with documents, photos, films and original recordings. Willy's private life and personality are also explored.

Committed European since childhood
Willy Brandt is shaped by experiences in his youth. Born Herbert Frahm in Lübeck, he joins the resistance when Hitler comes to power and flees to Norway and then Sweden. He took the pseudonym Willy Brandt for protection and kept it when he returned from exile and became more involved in politics. At the time when East Germany is building the Wall, Brandt becomes mayor of Berlin. He meets with John F. Kennedy at the Rathaus Schöneberg. In 1969, Brandt becomes the first SPD party Chancellor of West Germany and begins the work of building bridges with the East. And that's only part of what he achieves: Brandt's life is steeped in history and closely entwined with German history. After he dies, the German government founds the Bundeskanzler-Willy-Brandt-Foundation, which since 2010 has had its headquarters on the famous Unter den Linden boulevard. This is where you'll find the Willy Brandt Forum today, a political multimedia experience. The exhibition is divided into five themed chapters leading visitors through important events in Brandt's life, from his Norwegian exile up to his death in 1992. The bright, modern rooms display personal documents and photographs, such as his legal name change document from 1949 and his naturalisation certificate from 1948, all of which tell of his time in Norway and as mayor of a divided Berlin. On the display boards, you can get an overview of the highlights of his life story, and on the multimedia stations, there are videos and audio soundtracks. There is even a special audio tour for younger visitors.

More on German history and politics
In 1963, Kennedy stands in front of the Rathaus Schöneberg and speaks the famous words ""Ich bin ein Berliner"", and on the 10th of November 1989 Germans celebrate the fall of the Berlin Wall in front of the building, which is home to the exhibition now found in the Willy Brandt Forum until 2010. The current exhibition of the city hall carries biographies and stories about Jewish citizens of the Schöneberg district. The SPD party headquarters are housed in the Willy-Brandt-Haus in Kreuzberg, a traditional working class and trendy area of the city. Behind the modern glass and limestone facade, there is a large event and exhibition space. Don't miss the bronze Willy Brandt statue, already a local landmark.","Opening hours

The work and lifestyles of Die Brücke members were revolutionary at the beginning of the 20th century. At first meeting with mixed reactions, the group's work eventually acquired nationwide and international importance.

Exciting and ground-breaking expressionist works in an idyllic location
In the 1960s, Die Brücke member Karl Schmidt-Rottluff establishes a new exhibition building in Berlin. In September 1967, the Brücke-Museum opens at the edge of the Grunewald forest. The location in the countryside reflects the collective's strong focus on nature. The gallery features the artists' extensive collections and gifts from Die Brücke friends. The spirit of the group is both preserved and displayed. Behind the façade of the elegant building are four large, simple rooms. Here, the gallery presents the paintings of Die Brücke artists. They are characterised by clean lines, angular forms and striking contrasts. In the brightly-lit rooms, the colourful images of the Dresden Expressionists become even more impactful. In addition, see rare watercolours and drawings, crafts and sculptures. Throughout the year, the museum holds temporary exhibitions with a focus on a theme or particular Die Brücke member. Works by artists contemporary to Die Brücke are also exhibited: from the beginning die Brücke seeks out like-minded people. Since 1986, the museum additionally houses an archive of prints and documents.

The Deutsches Gewerbe-Museum and the birth of the Kunstbibliothek
In 1867, the Deutsches Gewerbe-Museum is founded as a teaching institute and public museum. The opening of the library follows a year later, and together they aim to further the knowledge of historic styles, techniques, materials, and traditional methods of artists and artisans. 1881 marks the opening of the Kunstgewerbemuseum's new building, now called the Martin-Gropius-Bau. Shortly after, in 1904, the library moves into an extension because of space restrictions, and from 1924 onwards, it functions as art library.
In 1994, the newly created Kulturforum provides a fresh home for the Kunstbibliothek and displays its collections of architecture, media, book and media art, photography, fashion and graphic design.
The library is further extended in 2004 with the opening of the Museum für Fotografie, and again in 2012 when the Archäologische Zentrum becomes part of the larger complex. Here you will find the Lipperheidesche Kostümbibliothek, Sammlung der Plakat- und Reklamekunst, the Gebrauchsgraphische Sammlung, Sammlung Buchkunst and the Sammlung Fotografie. The 
Kulturforum building also hosts the Kunstwissenschaftliche Bibliothek which focuses on the history of art and media in the western world. Discover the large Sammlung Buch- und Medienkunst housed within these striking red brick buildings, and delve into 13,000 artist books, records, films and printed media from the 20th and 21st century.

 site is deeply entwined with politics and history. It is where Germany’s federal states – the Bundesländer – have their offices to maintain their influence on national politics.
The grounds of the Ministergärten
The present site – on the corner of Ebertstraße and In den Ministergärten – was designed by the landscape architects Bernard and Sattler in 2007. Fifteen poplar trees are spread among seats and green embankments, some of which are planted with vines. Two entrances lead to the grounds. Three quarters of the 4000 square metre area can be hired for events such as presentations or 
parties. Walking through the grounds, there is always something new to discover. On one day it might be an open-air exhibition, on another the latest generation of cars, and every autumn the Jazz in den Ministergärten festival.
From the palace gardens to the bunker complex
The area near the Brandenburg Gate first got its name in 1732 when Friedrich Wilhelm I was king of Prussia. Wilhelmstraße was where Prussia’s most important ministries were located. These later came to include the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of State and the offices of Otto von Bismarck. In the 18th century, the ministers lived in the elegant palaces on Wilhelmstraße, which all had large gardens to relax in.
After the fall of the monarchy, during the Weimar Republic, the area remained the seat of the great state institutions. When the Nazis took power, they added the new Reich Chancellery to the old National Gallery on Vossstraße. In the garden of the Reich Chancellery, from 1940 onwards, a 
bunker complex was built, to which various facilities were added. This was where the Third Reich 
met its downfall ion the final days of the war. Hitler committed suicide and the Red Army took Berlin. In 1947, the Soviets attempted to blow up the bunker, and further demolition work started in 1959.
When the Berlin Wall was built, the bunker site and the Ministergärten were border territory. In 1973, parts of the complex were opened once again and documented. Along Wilhelmstraße (which was known at the time as Otto-Grotewohl-Straße), the reinforced steel roof of the bunker was removed and the cavity filled in so that blocks of flats could be built.

The offices of the Bundesländer are characterised by their individuality
After reunification, Berlin once again became the capital of Germany. Because all its federal states naturally wanted to be close to the centre of political power, 16 representative offices were built in Berlin to act as shop windows for the Bundesländer.
Between 1995 and 2001, representative offices for seven of them – Rhineland-Palatinate, Lower Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Saarland and Hesse – were built in a park complex on the corner of Ebertstraße and In den Ministergärten. Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern shared a building, as did Schleswig-Holstein with Lower Saxony. Each building was designed by a different architect’s office, which means every Bundesland has a very 
individual representation.
Because part of the Ministergärten was chosen for the site of the Holocaust Memorial, not all the Bundesländer were able to build offices here. The representations of Baden-Württemberg, Bremen and North Rhine-Westphalia are in the Tiergarten quarter, Hamburg is on Jägerstraße, Bavaria is on Behrenstraße, Thüringen on Mohrenstraße, Saxony on Brüderstraße and Saxony-Anhalt on Luisenstraße.",,,"Government district

In 1961, as East Germany is building a wall, you find American tanks stationed here. At the same time, resistance fighter Rainer Hildebrandt is building the Mauermuseum. Its mission: to catalogue escape plans as well as support escape attempts. Now the Mauermuseum is known for its extensive collection of items from 30 years of history, such as cars and hot air balloons that tell the stories of how successful escapees did it.

Haus am Checkpoint Charlie - travel back in time to a divided Berlin
Overnight in 1961, the East German authorities start building a wall through Berlin. For the next 30 years, it's not just the dividing line between capitalism and communism, but also between families. Stretching for over 155 km and equipped with watchtowers, the Wall seals off West Berlin. Refugees from the East start to arrive in West Berlin, and Rainer Hildebrandt starts to record their stories, starting the museum in his flat in 1962. A year later, the museum relocates to a building immediately adjacent to Checkpoint Charlie. Hildebrandt's museum soon becomes a focal point for escapees, helpers, journalists and protesters. Helpers provide the Checkpoint Charlie house with vehicles, tools and personal mementos. Innovative and full of information - this is the impression you get from the Mauermuseum - Haus am Checkpoint Charlie today. Take a look through the inventive methods people have used to escape from the GDR, such as a concealed luggage compartment in a VW car, a mini-submarine, a hot air balloon and a collapsed suitcase. Some of these methods actually work, and you can see how at the museum. The museum is also a gallery where international artists like Hannah Höch and Bulatow exhibit their works. Permanent displays look beyond Berlin and Germany with titles such as From Gandhi to Walesa, NATO Mission for Freedom and Raoul Wallenberg Lives.

Berlin",52.5156437,13.3685484,Park,2,FALSE,Tiergarten,"New York has Central Park – and Berlin boasts the popular Tiergarten Park! Ideal for a leisurely stroll, lying on the lawns or taking in some of the city’s sights.",,,"For Berliners, Tiergarten Park is the city’s green lung – just like New York’s Central Park or London’s Hyde Park. Close to the city centre and bordering such major sights as the Brandenburg Gate or 
Potsdamer Platz, the forested grounds cover a spreading 210 hectares, nearly 519 acres – slightly more than Hyde Park.
Tiergarten Park is very much at the heart of Berlin life – attracting joggers, skaters, cyclists and walkers, as well as those who just want to relax in the sun. The park’s spreading green lawns are popular for family picnics, ball games or simply unwinding and taking it easy – an ideal place to recharge your batteries on a break from some serious shopping or seeing the sights.
From royal hunting ground to public park
In the late seventeenth century, Friedrich III, then Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia, turned the former royal hunting grounds just outside the city into a “park for the pleasure of the general population”. Since then, Tiergarten Park has been re-designed a number of times, most substantially between 1833 and 1838. In this major makeover, Peter Joseph Lenné, Prussia’s leading landscape gardener, drew his inspiration from English models to transform the grounds and give the park the shape it still has today.
Tiergarten Park was badly damaged during the Second World War, especially in the fierce fighting around Berlin in the last year of the war. But it also suffered dramatically in the wake of the war. Facing an acute lack of coal in winter 1945/6, Berliners cut down what was left of the park’s trees as fuel, nearly deforesting the entire area. Tiergarten Park was replanted with trees from 1949, largely thanks to the many donations of trees from across Germany.

Memorials, the English Garden and a beer garden by a lake
Tiergarten Park not only offers winding tree-lined paths and open green spaces, but is also home to many interesting memorials as well as cultural and political sights. Close to the Brandenburg Gate, you can find the Soviet war memorial and the Global Stone peace project. Further on into the park, the arts and exhibition centre Haus der Kulturen der Welt is set attractively on the banks of the River Spree. The Office of the Federal President adjacent to Bellevue Palace, the official residence of the President of Germany, is to the west. Here too, you can find the Victory Column (Siegessäule) with its panoramic views of the city.
The Tea House, with its attractive terrace and views of the landscaped parkland, is also nearby.
For a waterside location, the Café am neuen See to the south is set on the shore of a small lake. The café’s beer garden is open almost all year round – and if it’s too cold to enjoy sitting outside, you can warm yourself by the fire indoors. From here, it’s only a short walk to the German Resistance Memorial Centre or the memorials for political activists Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg.
The sound of music in the park – every Sunday in summer!
Summer visitors to Tiergarten Park on a Sunday might well hear the sound of a rather unusual musical instrument – the bells played by a carillon. Built close to today’s Haus der Kulturen der Welt, the carillon in Tiergarten Park was opened in 1987 as part of Berlin’s 750th anniversary celebrations. The tower, which soars 42 metres high, has 68 bells – making it the world’s fourth largest carillon.
Open-air gas lantern museum
Once Berlin’s streets were lit with gas lanterns – and in some areas, they still are. To commemorate this historical form of street lighting, an open-air museum was established close to Tiergarten S-Bahn station in 1978. Today, the collection, which is permanently open to visitors, comprises nearly 100 gas lanterns from Berlin and other cities. When dusk falls, the lanterns are switched on, lighting up the paths in the park with their soft yellow light.

In spring, the stadium regularly hosts the German DFB cup final;
Every September, the athletes in the annual ISTAF international track and field meeting enjoy a rousing welcome;
In August 2018 athletes fought for medals at the European Athletics Championships in Berlin.

In summer, Berlin’s Olympiastadion is transformed into an open-air stage for the some of the world’s top events. The many legendary bands and musicians playing here over the past years have included such names as the Rolling Stones, Madonna, Robbie Williams, Depeche Mode and Coldplay.

Exploring the history of Berlin’s Olympiastadion
From 1934 to 1936, during the Nazi era, the old stadium on this site was demolished and a new stadium and sports complex built as the venue for the 1936 Olympic Games. Inspired by the clear geometric forms of sports’ arenas in the classical world, architect Werner March created a stadium capable of holding an audience of 100,000 people.

Today’s Maifeld is just one part of the Reichssportfeld (Imperial Sports Arena) planned by the Nazi regime as a site for propaganda events. The sports and events complex constructed for the Olympic Games also included the Waldbühne venue, designed like an ancient amphitheatre. In 1936, the Waldbühne was the site of the Olympic gymnastics competitions. Today, it has become a much-loved open-air concert venue, surrounded by green spaces.

Anyone visiting the Olympic Stadium complex is sure to visit the Glockenturm – the bell tower –, especially renowned for its amazing views. The lift whisks you to the top of the tower for a panoramic vista out across the nearby Maifeld and stadium to the city or over the Waldbühne to the woodlands beyond.

The eleventh Olympic Games took place from 1 to 16 August 1936. After 1936, another 20 major events were held at the Reichssportfeld, including the 1937 German football championship, the state reception for Mussolini and various sports festivals. At the beginning of the Second World War, the Reichssportfeld, which was partially set below ground level, was converted to a bunker, a production site for detonators, a storage area for munitions, food and wine, and a back-up radio broadcasting site.

A history trail on the Olympic site has 45 panels in English and German offering a fascinating insight into the complex’s origins and development down the years, as well as information on the historical art works from the early years of the Nazi regime.

On event-free days, you can explore the impressive stadium itself, either with an audio guide or as part of a guided tour. On live tours, you can also visit sectors normally off-limits to the public, including the locker rooms, underground warm-up halls, and the VIP areas.

The reopening
At the turn of the millennium, extensive modernisation work began while the sporting events continued. The lower ring was renovated and 13 luxury boxes were added to the upper ring. Today, the total capacity is 74,475 seats. On 1 August 2004, there was an official reopening ceremony for the Olympiastadion. Without doubt, one of the highlights in the history of the new Olympiastadion Berlin was its hosting of the 2006 World Cup Final. The German Cup Final has been held here since 1985, and it is the home stadium of Hertha BSC in the Bundesliga.
How to get to the Olympiastadion and more details

"Erich-Weinert-Straße
10409 
Berlin",52.5465903,13.4321523,Architecture,2,FALSE,Carl Legien housing estate,Bruno Taut’s last great success in Berlin,,,"Here, Bruno Taut proved just what town planning is capable of: high-density housing that still provides people with a sense of nature and an expanse of space.

The estate was Taut’s last major social housing project in Berlin. Exactly 1,149 apartments were built in a relatively small area around what is now Erich-Weinert-Straße. Most of them were small units with one-and-a-half to three rooms, not built for large families, but for single people or couples with one child at most.

Challenges for an architect
By the end of the 1920s, Bruno Taut was a well-known and respected figure in Berlin, and the leading creative architect of the GEHAG communal building society and housing association. Berlin was steadily growing and urgently needed new housing – a dream scenario for a forward-looking architect.

Of the six Berlin Modernism housing estates listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 2008, four were designed by Bruno Taut: an impressive ratio. Each of these projects posed different challenges for the architect to solve.

Gartenstadt Falkenberg (Falkenberg garden city), which he built before the First World War, still followed traditional housing estate plans, with many single-family homes. After this, Taut’s designs became increasingly modern. The Großsiedlung Britz (known as the Hufeisensiedlung, or horseshoe estate) and the Schillerpark estate were a contemporary response to the capital’s housing problem. From the mid-1920s onwards, Taut experimented with new living concepts outside of Berlin's densely built inner city.

A strict austerity policy necessitates a new approach
However, conditions changed at the end of the 1920s. There were fewer sites to build on and less money available. The real estate tax introduced by building commissioner Martin Wagner in 1924 could no longer be used for housing projects alone. Against the backdrop of the 1929 global economic crisis, the chancellor Heinrich Brüning ran a rigid austerity programme.
A change in thinking was required: housing projects had to be better adapted to the circumstances. The land for the new estate was located close to the edge of Berlin’s inner city. This made it expensive and the space was limited. Taut looked for a way to combine high-density housing with a feeling of generous space. His solution was to use space-saving perimeter blocks whose U-shape avoided closed courtyards. He arranged long housing blocks and side wings around wide courtyards.

Colour brings vitality
Bruno Taut placed great importance on the role of colour in architecture: this is especially evident at the “horseshoe” estate in Britz. Take some time to look at the details while walking past the five-storey buildings on Erich-Weinert-Straße.
The doors are painted in striking red-and-white or bright yellow, as are the window frames. Taut used these colours to break up the austere façades of his housing blocks – a simple, inexpensive design tool that became his trademark. He said himself:

“[…] colour brings vitality, and because it is easy to supply, we must insist upon it in these times of need […].”

The luxury of a balcony for everyone
The U-shaped arrangement of the buildings allowed Taut to make optimum use of the available area. He created large green spaces for a relaxing view between the buildings, which all residents of the Carl Legien estate could enjoy from their recessed balconies facing the courtyards. As previously with the Schillerpark estate, Taut drew inspiration from the buildings of the Dutch architect J.J. Pieter Oud. Up until then, the luxury of a balcony to relax on had been almost exclusively reserved for wealthy tenants in Berlin’s street-facing buildings.

The floor plans were just as thoughtfully designed. Functional rooms such as the kitchen and bathroom were located on the outside towards the street. The bedrooms and living room faced the courtyard with a view of the greenery.
The balconies of the corner buildings on Erich-Weinert-Straße wrapped around the corner. This had the advantage that they faced towards the sun, so that residents could enjoy direct sunlight almost the entire day long. And the corner balconies guide the visitor’s view directly into the housing estate’s inner courtyards.
As was typical for Taut’s creations, the courtyards followed a colour scheme, always with two colour-coordinated courtyards facing opposite one another: the walls of the recessed balconies were painted red, blue and green.

The old wash and boiler house still stands in the middle of one of the red courtyards. It fell into disuse in the 1980s and was left empty for many years before becoming a depot for the Bauhaus archive museum in 2008.

The politics of names
The inscription “Wohnstadt Carl Legien. Errichtet von der GEHAG 1929–1930” (Carl Legien housing estate. Constructed by GEHAG 1929–1930) was restored to the building on the corner of Erich-Weinert-Straße and Gubitzstraße in 2014. Legien was a German trade union leader and Social Democrat who died in 1920. The other streets in the housing estate were also named after Social Democrats.
The Nazis would not tolerate this choice of names. Shortly after they seized power, they renamed the streets after battlefields of the First World War’s Western Front and the district was known as the Flandernviertel (Flanders quarter).

A colour concept is lost – and restored
After the war, the streets were renamed in honour of murdered Communist resistance fighters. Bruno Taut’s original colour concept was lost in the meantime due to repair work. The uniform appearance of the housing estate was also lost, as some tenants converted their recessed balconies into conservatories. However, since the early 1990s a harmonised appearance in line with Bruno Taut’s design has been successfully restored to the site.

For its architecture alone, Cecilienhof is not a typical palace. Instead of white towers and flowery ornaments, it has bricks and half-timbered walls. From the outside, it looks rustic yet somehow mysterious.
The last palace built
The last palace of the Hohenzollern dynasty was begun in 1913 and scheduled for completion in 1915. Kaiser Wilhelm II had it built for his oldest son, Crown Prince Wilhelm. The prince and his wife Cecilie – after whom it was named – opted for the style of an English country house, having previously lived at the Marmorpalais, the Kaiser’s summer residence. The architect Paul Schultze-Naumburg, a conservative proponent of traditional architecture, was commissioned to build the palace. The eccentric combination of cottage style and 55 Tudor Gothic chimney stacks was intentional on the part of the architect and adds to the palace’s unique charm, along with the dark oak beams that decorate parts of the façade.
From the early Neoclassical palace to the modern country manor
Cecilienhof Country House was built in the north of Potsdam, in the 102.5 hectare park known as the Neuer Garten. When the palace was finally completed in 1917, the crown prince and his wife had no trouble adjusting to the surroundings, because their old residence, the Marmorpalais, was also in the Neuer Garten, just to the south, directly by the lake. The 176 rooms of Schloss Cecilienhof are spread around a number of courtyards. The crown prince’s apartment is on the first floor. There is a smoking lounge, a library, a music salon and a room designed like a cabin on an ocean liner. The interior design is characterised by its simplicity and elegance, with plenty of wood. A particular highlight is the carved wooden stairway leading to the first floor. This was a gift from the city of Danzig. Crown Prince Wilhelm and his wife Cecilie lived here until they fled in 1945.
The Potsdam Conference
At the end of the Second World War after Germany’s capitulation, the victorious allied powers met at Schloss Cecilienhof to decide on Germany’s future. The Potsdam Conference was attended by none less than Josef Stalin, Harry Truman and Winston Churchill (and later his successor Clement Attlee). Each of the “Big Three” was given their own room with its own furniture. Truman’s room, for example, had the Neoclassical furnishings from the Marmorpalais. The original furnishings that the Hohenzollerns had left behind when they fled were taken by the Soviets to another building where they were almost completely destroyed in a fire.
The negotiations at the conference lasted from 17 July to 2 August 1945, before ending in the Potsdam Agreement. Afterwards, the great hall of the palace was converted to a conference room with a round table.","Opening hours

Checkpoint Charlie was the setting for many thrillers and spy novels, from James Bond in Octopussy to The Spy Who Came In From The Cold.
Located on the corner of Friedrichstraße and Zimmerstraße, it is a reminder of the former border crossing, the Cold War and the partition of Berlin. The barrier and checkpoint booth, the flag and the sandbags are all based on the original site – and are a popular subject for photos. It’s no wonder that Checkpoint Charlie is one of the sights of Berlin that you really should see.
Where did Checkpoint Charlie get its name?
The name Checkpoint Charlie comes from the NATO phonetic alphabet (Alpha, Bravo, Charlie). After the border crossings at Helmstedt-Marienborn (Alpha) and Dreilinden-Drewitz (Bravo), Checkpoint Charlie was the third checkpoint opened by the Allies in and around Berlin.
What happened at Checkpoint Charlie in 1961?
It became the most famous crossing point between East and West Germany. On 22 September 1961, Allied guards began registering members of the American, British and French forces before trips to East Berlin and foreign tourists could find out about their stay there. Once the checkpoint was designated a crossing point for members of the Allied armed forces, a month later in October 1961 it became the scene of a tank confrontation. American and Soviet tanks took up position and faced each other with weapons primed.
Checkpoint Charlie as the scene of numerous escape attempts
Checkpoint Charlie was not only an important Cold War site, but also witnessed numerous attempts to escape from East Berlin. An open air exhibition on the corner of Schützenstraße and Zimmerstraße tells the story of those that failed and those that succeeded. An installation by the artist Frank Thiel and a commemorative plate also mark the memorial.

Its rooms are flooded with light, thanks to its large windows. Notice that the structure of the original building is only partially visible, a quirk that creates a fittingly rough charm. The 
exhibition rooms are mostly kept in the minimalist style of the 1950s. The focus is instead on the photographs themselves: artistic renderings of film stars, supermodels and politicians. Besides evocative portraits, you'll find snapshots of political events, some of social significance, some entertaining. Unique motifs and creative compositions grab your attention. But the exhibitions are not the whole picture. A thrilling array of lectures, panel discussions and artists' seminars let you delve deeper into the detail. You can also meet other photographers at the café in C/O Berlin, which is purposefully designed to promote collaboration.","Opening hours

Berlin",52.4122867,13.5666881,Architecture,2,FALSE,Falkenberg Garden City,In the south-east of Berlin you will find an early example of social housing: the Gartenstadt Falkenberg (Falkenberg garden city).,,,"Berlin, around 1910: The city was bursting at the seams, large parts of the population, especially the workers and lower classes, lived in tenements. Four- to five-storey buildings arranged in closed wings around an inner courtyard. This construction method led to unequal living conditions, with especially poor air and light conditions in the rear buildings. A contemporary piece of writing denounced this with the following words:
“[...] replacement of the musty, spoiled air [is] mostly impossible [...]. With every view out of the window you are compelled to come into contact with the neighbourhood, all feelings of cosiness and home are suspended here”
Rural advantages in the city
How were workers supposed to stay healthy in cramped, unhygienic housing conditions? Social reformers in England had already been trying to answer this question for several years. Around the turn of the century, the garden city movement was created in England. One of its pioneers was 
Ebenezer Howard with his work Garden Cities of Tomorrow. A central point of the movement was the “marriage of city and country”. This meant: neither as misanthropic as the big city, nor as pre-modern and underdeveloped as rural life. Life in these garden cities was meant to be economically self-sufficient and jointly organised.
In Germany, the idea fell on fertile ground. During the first decade of the 20th century, several estates of this kind were built. However, not as in England with the aim of economic self-sufficiency.
Founded in 1902, the Deutsche Gartenstadtgesellschaft (German Garden City Society) set up its own building cooperative for Greater Berlin. After tough negotiations, it succeeded in acquiring a plot of land around the Falkenberg in a hillside location near Altglienicke. In 1912, the then unknown architect Bruno Taut was commissioned to build a new estate based on the model of a garden city.
Taut’s original plan envisaged 1,500 apartments for up to 7,500 people. However, economic difficulties caused by the First World War put a spoke in the building cooperative’s wheel, and after 1918 the implementation of Taut’s concept came to a standstill.
An estate with a sense of community
Between 1913 and 1916, a total of 128 apartments were built in two construction phases. In 1913, Bruno Taut designed 23 residential units around the Akazienhof. He arranged 34 terraced houses in several groups for individual families as well as two semi-detached houses and one detached house around a central square.
The ensemble was intended to consciously serve as a reminder of a village idyll. Years before Bruno Taut’s design of the Hufeisensiedlung (horseshoe estate), the architect had already anticipated the concept of a closed residential courtyard. The view from the window was not intended to compel good neighbourliness, but to stimulate a sense of community. The first tenants moved in as early as 1913.
In 1914 and 1915, a further 94 apartments followed along the Gartenstadtweg, as well as a number of isolated residential buildings in 1916 despite the war. The site lay on a slope, so Taut adapted his clusters of houses to the terrain.
If you go for a walk in the estate today, you will notice that the houses are not arranged symmetrically. It was important to Bruno Taut to break with the symmetry of traditional architecture. His one- to two-storey houses are grouped together. Some are set back from the street to avoid straight axes. It almost seems as if the houses embody the individuals who are supposed to live in them. Each one separate, but united in the common space.
The individuality of the houses is particularly emphasised by a feature that Taut used here for the first time and which later became his trademark: the use of coloured wall surfaces as a design element.
Blue, red, black, yellow – limitless is the variety of colours in the estate. On Gartenstadtweg you will find a total of 14 different shades in different combinations. That’s why Gartenstadt Falkenberg is also referred to as “Tuschkastensiedlung” (box of watercolours estate). Thanks to a professional renovation in the 1990s, the colours shine as intensely today as they did shortly after construction of the estate.
However, it is not only different coloured façades that are used here. The architect also played with
 colour fields, geometric shapes and systematic contrasts between windows, doors and façades in his design. This was groundbreaking at the time. No bay windows, staircase towers or the like any more as decoration. But solely the clear form of the houses, shaped by the colouring.
Here, Bruno Taut took a significant step away from the flamboyant forms of the Gründerzeit, at the end of the 19th century, towards the later reduced style of classical modernism. However, he still used conventional elements. Saddle roofs with red plain tiles, white chimneys and wooden shutters emphasise the rural idyll.
Outside the music is playing
The main role of planting is already incorporated in the term “garden city”. The estate in Altglienicke also set standards here. It was the first residential development in Berlin with a sophisticated horticultural concept. The garden architect Ludwig Lesser, who was taken on specially for this purpose, systematically created allotment gardens. Each of the apartments had a garden, the size varied between 135 and 600 square metres, with fruit trees and trellises.
The green spaces still contained a remnant of the garden city’s idea of self-sufficiency. Each inhabitant was free to grow fruit and vegetables for their own needs. In addition, Ludwig Lesser’s garden architecture contributed to underlining Bruno Taut’s estate concept: avenues and hedges emphasised the spatial planning, while planting blended into the colour concept.
In this way, the living spaces and open spaces in the estate went hand in hand. Bruno Taut called this concept “outdoor living space”, forming a key characteristic of his architectural work.
Little guide to the architecture of Bruno Taut:

Our tips for the journey to the “Tuschkastensiedlung”
Those making their way from the city centre to Falkenberg and have time in hand can stop off at Adlershof. The ‘science city’ invites you to take a tour. You can visit exciting relics of aviation history such as the “Trudelturm” (large wind tunnel), as well as the electron storage ring BESSY II.
In the immediate vicinity of the estate, the Dahme river invites you to take a walk, cycle or swim. Directly in front of the Grünau S-Bahn station you can catch tram 68, which takes you to the Strandbad Grünau lido, among other places.
Writer Theodor Fontane previously described Grünau in his work “Wanderungen durch die Mark Brandenburg” (Wanderings through the March of Brandenburg). Grünau is also known for its 1936 regatta course and the GDR’s Olympic Games selection.",,,,https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/styles/visitberlin_bleed_header_visitberlin_mobile_1x/private/image/CRCNB1_sw_final_bearbeitet_CMYK_DL_PPT_0.jpg?h=7da83ebc&itok=CtW8Hf7G,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/falkenberg-garden-city,,,,

The DDR Museum brings the German Democratic Republic back to life. Visit a typical, 120 square metre Plattenbau flat and, at the same time, learn about Stasi surveillance techniques, the history of East Germany, and about the everyday life of people in the former Soviet occupied zone.
Origins and highlights of the DDR museum
During the time of the GDR, the eastern part of Berlin is the capital of the Socialist Unified State. The wave of nostalgia at the beginning of the 2000s raises questions about why, since reunification, there is no exhibition in Berlin depicting the East German experience. This is exactly what Freiburg ethnologist Peter Kenzelmann thinks when he arrives in Berlin in 2004. He takes charge of the project and opens the DDR Museum in the heart of the city. It is an instant success – in the first year, 180,000 people come to experience everyday life in former East Germany. In 2008, and again in 2012, the house is nominated for a European Museum of the Year Award by the European Museum Forum (EMF).
The theme of the museum is participation and immersion. The GDR exhibition shows many sides to everyday life, private as well as social. In 27 themed areas, you can see, for example, postcards sent home by children attending a Free German Youth holiday camp. In the media section, listen to East German music and stories about visits to the West. On the second floor is a five room flat furnished with astonishing attention to detail: look through the school jotters in the children's room, and see the GDR produced hats, skirts and shirts hanging in the wardrobe. Walk through into the kitchen, and you'll see the typical Resopal cabinets, spice racks and the ultra-modern pressure cooker – or revel in memories on the living room sofa. After leaving the house, you'll be in the Trabi area. Now a cult vehicle, you'll forget all about your own car. Turn the key in the ignition, hear the engine rattle and the pedals squeal as you press down on the accelerator. The 3D simulation in windscreen makes you feel like you're really driving past the shopping malls and prefabricated Plattenbau buildings of East Berlin. Finally, leave East Germany through a hole in the Wall.

Finding the right atmosphere for the museum is important, so to the left and right of the entrance are images of historical street views. In-between the many two-wheelers on display are life-sized mannequins outfitted in motorcycle gear from the time. The walls display historical photographs and posters of classic bikers riding their motocycles. The exhibition spreads out over almost 1,000 square metres and over two floors.

There, on the former site of the Old Synagogue destroyed in World War II, stands the ""Block of Women"" memorial to the women's uprising of 1943. Some 8,000 Jewish citizens of Berlin were detained at the end of February 1943 as part of a renewed wave of deportations by the SS and the Gestapo. This included some 2,000 Jews, mostly men, who were partners in mixed marriages which had until then been tolerated and spared from persecution. Separated from the rest of the prisoners, they were taken to the building which had formerly housed the Jewish Welfare Administration in Rosenstraße 2-4. Out of desperation and dismay about the uncertain fate of their husbands and fathers, the women gathered in front of the building with their children on the evening of 27 February 1943 and demanded to speak with their loved ones. There followed a later call for the release of their family members from the so-called ""Factory Action"", the euphemism used to denote the final round-up of Berlin's Jews in 1943. For a week, some 600 women engaged in daily protests.
On 6 March 1943, the first prisoners were released, with the remaining detainees released in the following days. The women's protest was peaceful and none of those involved were punished. Today, a sculpture created by Ingeborg Hunzinger serves as a monument to the courage of the women who put their lives at risk to secure the freedom of their husbands. Furthermore, the monument stands as a reminder of the day-to-day discrimination and ethnic persecution and its ultimate consequences for the Jewish culture. The monument consists of six elements: three reddish sandstone blocks with carved Jewish characters, texts and symbols form a semicircle around a couple lying in each other's arms. Two of these blocks have been staged as torn apart and yet assembled into a unit. From one part emerges a man turned towards a woman emerging from the other part. This scene is symbolic of the events surrounding the women's protests on Rosenstraße. Other characters portray desperation and fear, but also the cohesion and unity of the Jewish people against the totalitarian regime. A man standing to the side holding a broken violin depicts how the Nazi dictatorship destroyed the Jewish culture.

The memorial

In 1999, after lengthy debates, the German parliament decided to establish a central memorial site, the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. The competition to design it was won by the New York architect Peter Eisenman. The memorial was ceremonially opened in 2005.

On a site covering 19,000 square metres, Eisenman placed 2711 concrete slabs of different heights. The area is open day and night and from all four sides you can fully immerse yourself in the fully accessible spatial structure. The memorial is on a slight slope and its wave-like form is different wherever you stand. The uneven concrete floor gives many visitor a moment of giddiness or even uncertainty. Its openness and abstractness give you space to confront the topic in your own personal way. The sheer size of the installation and its lack of a central point of remembrance call into question the conventional concept of a memorial. This creates a place of remembrance, but not with the usual means.


A place of information

The memorial to the Shoah is supplemented by the underground information centre, also designed by Eisenman. In a space covering 800 square metres you can find information on the victims and the locations. Themed rooms such as the Room of Dimensions, the Room of Families, the Room of Names and the Room of Sites deal with the fates of individuals, with photographs, diaries and farewell letters. Short biographies take the victims out of their anonymity. Historical photographs and film footage show the sites of persecution and extermination.

Information for schools

As well a guided tours (from €40 per group), schools workshops are available for €85 per group. The tours and workshops are primarily designed for secondary schools.

From the discussion to the memorial
The opening of the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe (Holocaust Memorial) led to increased discussions about national memorials to all the other victims of the Nazis. In 2003, the German parliament decided to build a monument for the persecuted homosexuals. The initiators of the project chose a design by the Scandinavian artists Michael Elmgreen and Ingar Dragset. Their work picks up on the slabs of the Holocaust Memorial and uses the medium of film to create a link to the present and visualise the subject in a special way. The memorial was ceremonially opened on 27 May 2008.

What makes the 3.60 metre high and 1.90 metre wide concrete cube is a small, square window set in the exterior, though which visitors can watch a homosexual love scene on a video loop. The memorial is conceived so that the film is changed at regular intervals. A memorial plaque has information in German and in English.

Many minorities were persecuted under the Nazis. Their daily lives were made difficult, they were oppressed, persecuted and murdered in concentration camps. Homosexual men had to be very careful. In 1935, the criminal code was changed, with section 175 penalising kissing in public with a stay in prison or a house of correction. Their tormentors also imposed castration. In total, 50,000 sentences were passed. Lesbians were pursued by the Nazis as antisocial elements. In concentration camps, homosexual men were made to wear a pink triangle and lesbians a black triangle.

The monument to the homosexuals persecuted by the Nazi regime is a symbol against intolerance, discrimination and persecution of homosexuals all over the world.",,,"Third Reich Memorials

Here you can find unusual objects spread out before you. Among the more than 3,000 strange-looking industrial objects are dentist chairs, prosthesis, lamps and shop window mannequins. The arrangements of the artefacts provide for creative interpretations. This museum is intended to astonish visitors, making you constantly ask “What in the world is that?”

A surreal walk through 100 years of industrial design
For decades, Vlad Korneev of Moscow collects old medical devices, unusual industrial objects and everyday things. He finds most of these at local flea markets or in the city's cellars, and saves them for posterity. Today, they are exhibited in his DesignPantotikum. The museum is located in a DDR-Plattenbau building. Behind its grey façade, the strange objects make for a colourful and confusing collection. But the exhibition is not as arbitrary as it seems at first glance. The creative concept is well thought out. Having said this, there is no such thing as a description for these objects: Korneev wants visitors to go on a voyage of discovery, and the objects should speak for themselves. The exhibition looks like a huge installation of everyday objects and technical innovations of the past. For example, you'll find strange vehicles, protective suits and even a cat submarine. As you enter you ask: what is the function of these objects, and what era are they from? Both logic and imagination are required here. The best wrong answers are collected on a “best-of” list. Some answers are a little scary: for example, the iron lung – ""a ventilation machine that works more like a metal coffin."" The ingenious lighting with design lamps also creates an surreal atmosphere. The rooms themselves are also a curiosity: on the walls you can still see the characters of a former Chinese and GDR restaurant.

The museum explores the Second World War and its consequences from the perspective of both countries. It also looks at relations between Germany and Russia from 1917 through to the 1990s. See 1,000 square metres of exhibition space filled with a selection of militaria, propaganda and everyday objects which brings the lives of soldiers and civilians on each side vividly to life.

The end of World War II in Berlin's armed forces headquarters
In 1945, the officers' mess at the former spy training school of the German armed forces is the location of a historic event. On the evening of May 8th, representatives of the Third Reich and the Russian Red Army meet, and the Germans sign the unconditional surrender. Europe and the world breathes a sigh of relief. Between 1967 and 1994, the building hosts East Germany's ""Great Patriotic War"" museum. May 19th 1995, on the 50th anniversary of the end of war, the German-Russian Museum finally opens its doors.

The first thing you see when entering the museum's grounds is a Soviet T34 tank. Inside, the displays tell the story of the Nazi regime's attempts to exterminate the USSR, and you can learn about the occupation from both Soviet and German perspectives. The extensive photo archive and Soviet propaganda maps will transport you back to the 1940s, focusing on the everyday lives of Soviet prisoners of war. Items from the battlefront bring the experience to life: weapons, mines, uniforms and military medical objects. The museum is designed to shock, with details of the death and planned starvation of millions of Soviets. The tour highlight is the magnificent dining room in the officers' mess where the surrender was signed. Newsreel footage shows the events in the spot where it happened.

But you ought to visit the exhibition inside – it’s definitely worth it.,,,"Gendarmenmarkt in Mitte is an impressive square where two imposingly domed buildings called the Französischer Dom and the Deutscher Dom frame the rightly admired Konzerthaus.
Like its counterpart the Französischer Dom, the Deutscher Dom takes its name from the domed structure on top of it. Despite what many assume, it is not a church (“Dom” is the German word for a cathedral).

History of the Deutscher Dom
When it was first built at the beginning of the 18th century it actually was a church. Later, under Friedrich II, Carl von Gontard embellished the two churches with magnificent Baroque domes, purely for bombastic decoration.

After the March Revolution of 1848, the revolutionaries laid out their fallen comrades on the steps of the Deutscher Dom and many Berliners attended a church service to take their leave of them at Gendarmenmarkt. The scene was depicted by the Berlin artist Adolph Menzel in his painting The Laying-Out of the Fallen March Revolutionaries.

Destroyed in 1943 by a fire, the Deutscher Dom lay in ruins for a long time, and was only rebuilt in stages between 1982 and 1996

The exhibition Milestones – Sidetracks – Setbacks
Today the Deutscher Dom houses the Bundestag’s exhibition Milestones – Sidetracks – Setbacks. In an interactive and entertaining way, the exhibition on five floors presents the changing history of the parliamentary system from the March Revolution of 1848 to the present day. The exhibition used to be in the Reichstag and was part of the programme for every school trip from West Germany to Berlin.

The exhibition gives you an overview of the development and the work of the political parties in Germany. Photos, installations and films illustrate parliament’s turbulent history: the first National Assembly in 1848, development during the German Empire, the destruction of democratic systems by the Nazis, and the new beginning in the post-war years.","Opening hours (additional information)

It’s the oldest tree in Berlin and is even older than the city itself.,,,"Dicke Marie – fat Mary – was once the nickname of a cook, but today, it’s the name of Berlin’s oldest living resident. Nobody knows exactly how old Dicke Marie is – and no-one can ask her either. She is thought to be between 800 and 900 years old. If you still haven’t guessed: Dicke Marie is the oldest tree in the Berlin – older than the city itself.
A fabled past
In 1237 Dicke Marie was already watching as the mediaeval town grew up nearby. Later she saw robber barons and kings riding through the woods by Lake Tegel where she lived then and still does today. Many trees have grown up around her to keep her company. The famous poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe is said to have paid her a visit when passing through. It was only later that the pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) was given the name “Dicke Marie” by two young boys.
How Dicke Marie got her name
Those two boys were none other than Wilhelm and Alexander von Humboldt, who grew up in the palace known as Schloss Tegel, where their tutors taught them statistics, economics, natural law and philosophy. To amuse themselves, they would sometimes wander through the woods, always looking for new adventures. Once, they came across the huge oak tree. legend has it that the boys were amazed by the tree and it reminded them of their cook. From then on, they called it “Dicke Marie” after their sturdily built cook.
Tegel Forest: a popular day-trip destination
From the harbour bridge in Tegel it’s only a few minutes’ walk to Dicke Marie, who is waiting for you in Tegel Forest. When you visit the castle or take a steamer trip, it’s well worth taking time to see the famous oak. The 26-metre-tall tree has an aura of calm and wisdom.

Just 30 minutes from Berlin's main railway station, this moor offers plenty of fresh air, peace, and quiet. The genista is a bright yellow next to the ruins of the athletes' village built for the 1936 Olympics. German troops under both the Kaiser and Hitler once did their military exercises here, followed by the Soviet Army after the war. Then the Berlin Wall fell and the GDR and the Red Army became a thing of the past. But the unique landscape of Döberitzer Heide remained.


The 1936 Olympic Village
Prussian kings Frederick William I and Frederick the Great already used these fields for military exercises three centuries ago, although, at the time, the city limits of the Prussian capital were much further away. Kaiser Wilhelm II then established a military training grounds at Döberitz in 1892. Berlin's Heerstraße (""Army Street"") still bears witness to this fact, as it leads directly from the former military training grounds to the Kaiser's palace on Museum Island.
Then the Olympic Village was erected here for the 1936 Summer Olympics held in Berlin. Nearly 4,000 athletes called it home during the competition. In addition to a fancy reception building, more than 140 residential buildings, separate kitchens, a sports hall, a swimming pool, and a hospital were built here. Particularly striking is the semi-circular House of Nations which featured 38 dining halls.
Of course, the Nazi regime did not put in so much effort without an agenda. The peaceful use of the space for the Olympics was part of a deceptive manoeuvre, because  an infantry school and military hospital took over the grounds right after the Olympic Games, as part of Germany's secret preparations for war. The Olympic Village is now a listed site and can only be viewed during guided tours.


Döberitzer Heide
After the end of World War II, the Red Army used the site for extensive military exercises until 1992, which left its impact on the landscape. The site is now a valuable open landscape with moors, sandy areas, and dry meadows. It is a habitat for thousands of animal and plant species, some of them very rare or even endangered.
As early as 1987, before the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Soviets had declared a part of the military training ground a nature reserve and the work of conservationists was tolerated, as evidenced by a document written by then Soviet Commander Solnikov.


Naturschutz-Förderverein ""Döberitzer Heide"" e.V.
Since the withdrawal of the Soviet troops in 1992, this special landscape has been at risk of growing over with weeds.  The newly founded conservation association began to take care of it, first by grazing Galloway cattle on the landscape. This was later followed by the local species of moorland sheep (Heidschnucke), donkeys, horses, and goats. The association is rehabilitating a Russian tank training range for use as a nature conservation and landscape maintenance centre.
If you want to learn more about the Döberitzer Heide and its rare flora and fauna, you can take part in guided hikes. Groups, hiking clubs, and school classes can also arrange special hiking days, complete with snack or coffee on request. Have a relaxing day getting to know the wild side of Eastern Germany!


The Sielmann Döberitzer Heide Nature Landscape
The Heinz-Sielmann-Stiftung has attracted several nearly extinct species of wild animals on its 3,600 hectare site. Today, European bison, Przewalski's horses, and red deer now graze the moors at Döberitzer Heide, where they are gradually returning to the habits they once had in the open wilderness. Visitors can explore the landscape in this protected area on 55 km of hiking trails and 13 km of horse trails. There are picnic areas and a lookout tower that offers a unique panorama of the landscape even over to TV Tower in Berlin.


Karls Erlebnis-Dorf
Karls Erlebnis-Dorf in Elstal is like stepping into a whole other world. Together with the tasty strawberries on sale here from May to October, there is a lot more for young and old to experience. There are also plenty of treats from the wood-fired bakery as well as homemade jams and candy. The corn maze, the haunted house, and a world made of real ice figures all guarantee plenty of unforgettable experiences. The farm market also offers everything imaginable made of strawberries together with some lovely things from the region, handcrafted toys, and country-style decorations. The farm kitchen and the pancake forge also make sure no one leaves with an empty stomach.

With more than a million visitors each years, it is one of the most frequently visited museums and memorial centres in Berlin.
The exhibitions on the site
The permanent exhibition Topography of Terror. Gestapo, SS and Reich Security Main Office on Wilhelm- und Prinz-Albrecht-Straße tells you about these institutions and the crimes that were organised there. At five locations, photographs and documents illustrate the history from the time the Nazis took power until the end of the war.
You will find out even more in the special and temporary exhibitions which deal with various aspects of national socialism.
A second permanent exhibition in the trenches excavated along Niederkirchnerstraße looks at Berlin’s role as the capital of the ”Third Reich” and is open from spring to autumn. Exhibition panels tell the story of Berlin in the Weimar republic, Berlin under the Nazis and during the war, and the consequences of Nazi rule. The glass panels let you look into the excavations on the site.
Tour of the site
The tour takes in 15 information stations directly where the crimes were planned. Photographs, graphics and documents provide detailed information. The site also contains the longest surviving section of the Berlin Wall in the centre of Berlin.
Dokumentationszentrum NS-Zwangsarbeit
The museum’s foundation also runs the Nazi Forced Labour Documentation Centre in Schöneweide on the site of a former labour camp.
Historic Wilhelmstraße
Many ministries of the Nazi state were located on nearby Wilhelmstraße in the former government quarter. 30 panels tell the story of the buildings.
History of the site
In the summer of 1933, the Gestapo began to use the Secret State Police Office as a so-called ""house prison"" for political prisoners. In the offices they interrogated and tortured the prisoners. Most of them were then transferred to prisons and concentration camps. The Gestapo imprisoned a total of 15,000 opponents of the National Socialist regime in the ""house prison"". The prisoners also included Georg Elser, members of the resistance groups of the Red Chapel, the Kreisau Circle and the July 20 resistance.
After the end of the war, the site lay fallow for a long time. It was not until 1987, at the 750th anniversary celebration, that an initially temporary exhibition was created, which quickly developed into a permanent project due to the great interest shown.","Opening hours

Almost at the end of the peninsula you come to an old church. If it’s a Sunday in summer between midday and 4 p.m. you can take a look inside Stralau’s village church, and discover the only mediaeval stained glass in all of Berlin.
The history of the church
At the end of the headland between the river Spree and Lake Rummelsburg, in Stralau cemetery, is Friedrichshain’s oldest church, built in the 15th century. Although it has been modified and renovated many times over the years, the nave and pentagonal choir have survived from mediaeval times. The church originally had a half-timbered steeple, but today, after several modifications, it has a Neo-Gothic appearance. In the 19th century, a Brick Gothic vestibule was added. Today, the church, together with its cemetery and the chapel, form a group of listed buildings on the eastern edge of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg.
What makes it special are the glass windows with their Late Gothic stained-glass art. Works such as the Flagellation of Christ from 1460 and a portrait of St. George from 1510 decorate the interior. And that makes it unique in Berlin. The chalice-shaped font is believed to be older than the church itself.
The church did not get its Late Gothic winged altar until 1962 when it was rebuilt after the Second World War. Until then, it had not had an altar.

At the Dorotheenstädtischer Friedhof the gravestones and memorials read like a Who’s Who of Germany’s intellectual elite.

The history of the cemetery
The cemetery at the Dorotheenstädtische Kirche was opened in 1762. The name Dorotheenstadt comes from Dorothea, the second wife of the Great Elector, Friedrich Wilhelm. The area was outside the Berlin Customs Wall and from 1800 onward Berlin’s first heavy industry developed in the part of it known as Feuerland. The cemetery initially served as a burial place for ordinary citizens, but because institutions such as the Academy of Arts, the Choral Academy, the Academy of Science, the Academy of Architecture and the University Unter den Linden were all in the parish, the social standing of the people buried in the cemetery changed.
The graves in the cemetery became more and more expensive and ornate and it became the final resting place for notable figures. The City of Berlin maintains many graves of honour there.

Graves of important Berliners
The people buried in the Dorotheenstädtischer Friedhof include the philosophers Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel and Johann Gottlieb Fichte. The authors Heinrich Mann, Johannes R. Becher, Arnold Zweig and Anna Seghers also have their last resting place here. The grave of the theatre director Heiner Müller is decorated with a birdbath in the shape of an ashtray and his fans often leave cigars for the inveterate smoker. One of Berlin’s most notable sculptors was Johann Gottfried Schadow, who designed his own grave, and his contemporary Christian Daniel Rauch lies not far away. Berlin’s greatest architects, Karl Friedrich Schinkel and Friedrich August Stüler are also buried here, as are the artists John Heartfield, Wieland Herzfelde, Hanns Eisler, and the printer and publisher Ernst Theodor Litfaß. There is a large and ornate tomb to the industrialist August Borsig and his family, whose house was opposite the cemetery.
By contrast, two simple fieldstones mark the grave of Bertolt Brecht and Helene Weigel. At the entrance to the cemetery is the Bertolt-Brecht-Haus, where the pair lived their last years and which now houses the Brecht archive and the literary forum.

Notable Berlin figures who have been given a grave of honour in recent times include the actor Otto Sander, the theatre director Georg Tabori, the former president Johannes Rau, the philosopher Herbert Marcuse, the human rights activist Bärbel Bohley and the West Berlin commune founder Fritz Teufel.

A stone slab and a simple cross commemorate the members of the plot to kill Hitler on 20 July 1944, eight of whom were buried here after they were murdered shortly before the end of the war. Dietrich Bonhoeffer and Hans von Dohnanyi, whose burial places are not known, are also honoured on the stone.

The chapel and the light installation by James Turrell
Light in all its magic and light as a divine being are represented by the artist James Turrell’s installation in the chapel, which was restored in 2015. Just as in mediaeval Gothic churches, the blazing, coloured light is a sign of God. The fascinating light installation begins every evening after sunset. Guided tours and viewings are available without booking in advance.

Französischer Friedhof
The Französischer Friedhof is also on the site. From 1780 to 1835 it was used by the French Protestant community as a cemetery for the descendants of the Huguenots.
Many beautiful Neoclassical monuments mark the graves. Friedrich August Stüler created the opulent grave of the industrialist and collector Pierre Louis Ravené, and famous figures such as Jenny Gröllmann are buried here.

The northern part of this central station is still standing on its premises. Dating back to 1885, it is the oldest surviving architectural example of Germany's electricity industry. The surviving Buchhändlerhof substation was built between 1926 and 1928 on the basis of plans by architect Hans Heinrich Müller. Müller had to design the substation under very difficult conditions, whereby the existing development of housing blocks forced him to find a space-saving solution. The substations were thus stacked neatly on top of one another over nine storeys and grouped around three areaways.

The East Side Gallery: A whole 1.3 kilometres of history and art
At 1316 metres long, the open-air art gallery on the banks of the Spree in Friedrichshain is the longest continuous section of the Berlin Wall still in existence. Immediately after the wall came down, 118 artists from 21 countries began painting the East Side Gallery, and it officially opened as an open air gallery on 28 September 1990. Just over a year later, it was given protected memorial status.
In more than a hundred paintings on what was the east side of the wall, the artists commented on the political changes in 1989/90. Some of the works at the East Side Gallery are particularly popular, such as Dmitri Vrubel’s Fraternal Kiss and Birgit Kinders’s Trabant breaking through the wall. They are not just a popular subject for postcards – you’re sure to want to photograph them yourself.
Out in the open air, the East Side Gallery is completely exposed to the weather, which means that there are regular efforts to restore it. In 1996, Kani Alavi founded East Side Gallery e. V., an artists’ initiative to preserve and restore the works. By 2000, a 300-metre stretch of the wall had already been restored and 33 pictures repainted, and in 2009 the whole East Side Gallery was restored. 87 artists took part and 100 paintings were restored.In November 2018, the State of Berlin transferred the East Side Gallery to the property of the Stiftung Berliner Mauer (SBM), which is thus responsible for the preservation of the monument.
Attractions around the East Side Gallery
Warschauer Straße and Ostbahnhof railway stations are the perfect starting points for a walk along the East Side Gallery. And there’s also plenty to discover either side of it. Opposite the East Side Gallery, for instance, is the Mercedes Benz Arena, a venue for sporting and musical events. On the 
Oberbaumbrücke, two giant hands play scissors-paper-stone. They represent the two districts of Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg that the bridge connects. Or use the banks of the Spree as a starting point for a leisurely boat trip through Germany’s capital city.",,,"Memorials

Since it opened in 1844, the zoo has had many famous animals – from Bobby the gorilla to Knut the polar bear.

Bao Bao and Yan Yan were everybody’s favourites at the zoo, but since the pair died, the zoo hasn’t had any pandas. Now, talks are done with China, and a pair of pandas moved into the zoo in summer 2017. A new enclosure including a Chinese musical pavilion was built just vor them.

The history of the zoo

In the mid-19th century, the famous naturalist Alexander von Humboldt, the African explorer Martin Hinrich Lichtenstein and the landscape designer Peter Joseph Lenné proposed the opening of a zoological garden in Berlin. After three years under construction, the site designed by Lenné opened its gates in 1844. Its first inhabitants were the animals that King Friedrich Wilhelm IV donated from his menagerie and pheasantry in the Tiergarten. Over the years, the site of the zoo was redesigned and extended a number of times. Of the 4000 animals it housed before the Second World War, only 91 survived, and many of its buildings were destroyed which you will not see nowadays. Today, the Zoologischer Garten is one of Berlin's most visited attractions.

But what is the real power behind all this? What is necessary to get electricity from the power station to the end user without interference? How did things look 100 years ago, and to what extent is the Berlin ""electropolis"" pioneering the development of technology? The permanent exhibition of the Berlin Energy Museum is an exciting introduction into these questions. Located in a former battery storage facility in Steglitz, the museum has over 5,000 exhibits from all aspects of power generation. Interacting is allowed and actively encouraged.

A museum to touch
Founded in 2001 by previous employees of the former Bewag AG (Berliner Städtische Elektrizitätswerke), from 1911 to 1994 the site of the museum is a power station operated by Bewag. In the open air, you now meet the first exhibition about network technology: three man-sized transformers stand next to an advertising column. You can see the individual components of station technology and understand their functions. You then enter the halls of the former battery storage system. One topic is power plant engineering. The task of a power plant is to convert primary energy like coal into electrical energy. You can understand this process by means of turbines, pumps and valves. On the model of a combined cycle power plant, you can control the start-up process. In order to protect the power supply from faults such as short circuits, overloads and lightning strikes, additional protection is important. Try out a 10 kV model for the end user's power supply. You can also simulate an error and take necessary steps to protect the network. The exhibits include clocks, meter technology and devices for current and voltage measurement. In communication technology, experiment with a hand-held system, use a telecommuter and see how a Strowger switch works. Work safety is also a topic, including a large archive of former work regulations, fire extinguishers and medical service equipment. Especially interesting is the exhibition on public lighting, covering the period from the introduction of street lighting back in 1884 to the present day. At the other end of the power grid, 120 years of development history can be viewed, including common household appliances such as heaters, an old sewing machine and a collection of radio equipment.

Various audio and video installations, as well as interactive stalls give a concrete, immediate impression of the turbulent events around this border stronghold. The reasons for the rise and fall of the Wall are vividly brought to life in the exhibition making use of contemporary reports and historic source material.

Multimedia reconstruction of the fall of the Berlin Wall
Until 1989, this is still a restricted zone: watchtowers, automatic rifles, and the so-called ""anti-fascist protection wall"" sealed off the Friedrichshain section of the river Spree in the German Democratic Republic. After the turn of the century, international artists paint the Mühlenstraße section of the wall. It is the canvas for world famous works such as the Brother Kiss between Brezhnev and Honecker. Directly behind this is an old mill storage. Politicians and international experts such as Michail Gorbatschow and Guido Kane push to establish a private museum here on the 25th anniversary of reunification. In 2016, the East Side Gallery Museum opens its doors. The exhibition is a deliberate multimedia space. You can see video excerpts and interviews with involved entrants including, among others, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Helmut Kohl and Michail Gorbatschow. Through 13 different rooms, the museum focuses on what you should know about the Wall. This begins with the end of the Second World War and continues in 1961: In an original film, see how workers build the Wall. A concrete mixer, barbed wire and original elements of the Wall add to the atmosphere of these moving images. Witnesses and written information report on victims of border shootings, Willy Brandt's Neue Ostpolitik (new Eastern policy) and the situations caused by the division. The museum links reflections of the Cold War with art: works by Keith Haring, Pink Floyd's epic music drama ""The Wall"" and the song ""Wind of Change"" by the Scorpions are part of the multimedia concept.

The hexagonal fortification was sunk into the hill known as Hahneberg so that even from at close distance it is almost undetectable. However, Fort Hahneberg was never used for military manoeuvres: rapid progress in the development of artillery shells overtook the fort’s design and rendered it useless even before it was completed. And so the fort was used for other, very interesting purposes.

",,,"A hill for flying
Lilienthal experimented with his first flying machines on various hills around Berlin. Near his house in Lichterfelde, where his brother Gustav built ornate villas, he had an artificial hill built in 1894 from rubble. The hill was nearly 60 metres high and Lilienthal used it to test his gliders – performing over a thousand flights, managing distances of more than 80 metres.
The Fliegeberg today
When the park was redesigned between 1928 and 1933, the architects cut down the trees on the hill and created terraces leading up it. You can easily climb up the steps to the top of the hill and enjoy the sweeping view.
A round pillared hall on the top of the hill commemorates Otto Lilienthal’s dream of flying. The bronze globe inside is a replica, because the original one was melted down during the war.
Every year in the park, the Fliegefest is held in honour of Lilienthal and his pioneering deeds.
The grave at Lankwitz cemetery
Lilienthal crashed in 1896 during a test flight on the Gollenberg near Stölln and died from his serious injuries. His grave is at the cemetery in Lankwitz. The inscription “Sacrifices have to be made” was added to the grave in 1940. According to legend, these were Lilienthal’s last words, although eye-witnesses reported otherwise.  
Lilienthal’s house among the villas of Lichterfelde West
While Otto was taking to the skies, his brother Gustav was busy building magnificent pseudo-mediaeval houses in the new villa district of Lichterfelde West. Otto Lilienthal’s house at Boothstraße 17 no longer exists. Take a stroll through the area past Tuscan mansions, great houses with pointed arches and ornamental bridges, and villas with gables and turrets.

"Tempelhofer Damm 1-7
12101 
Berlin",52.4829799,13.386262,Architecture,2,FALSE,Flughafen Tempelhof (Tempelhof Airport),British architect Norman Foster called it the “mother of all airports”. Tempelhof has lost none of its attraction to this day.,,,"Tempelhofer Feld was an aviation location early on. This is where the American aviation pioneer Orville Wright demonstrated his skills in 1909, and spectators marvelled at the new Zeppelin airships.
Due to a substantial increase in motorised aircraft after the First World War, there was an increased need for a centrally located airport. The first buildings that were constructed quickly proved to be too small. Berlin was a thriving metropolis with a growing number of air passengers.
Modern and monumental
Between 1936 and 1939, architect Ernst Sagebiel designed what would be the biggest airport in Europe at that time on the Tempelhofer Feld: an elegantly curved new building of over 1.2 kilometres in length with 9,000 rooms. It was one of the few Nazi building projects that came to fruition, albeit not completely, and demonstrated the ambivalence between modern construction methods and monumental architecture during the Nazi era.
The exaggerated monumental architecture of the airport building aimed to impress with its natural stone façade. The reception building is characterised by an ornate façade with 21 entrance doors, reliefs, and sculptures such as the giant aluminium eagle, whose head still stands in front of the building to this day. The doors don’t take visitors straight to the entrance hall, but to a hall of honour, which was also to be given an elaborate design.
However, hidden behind the façade with shell limestone slabs and window surrounds made of Jura limestone is a modern construction. During the Weimar Republic, Ernst Sagebiel worked for the architect Erich Mendelsohn. When Mendelsohn had to flee Germany after the Nazis took power, Sagebiel made a career out of modern building techniques.
Sagebiel erected Tempelhof on a steel skeleton construction, which observers can clearly see from the airfield. Despite its monumentality, the airport has a functional design: the architect systematically divided the procedures according to air passengers, baggage, cargo, and mail. This enabled passengers to quickly get from the check-in area to the gate. And the 40-metre, 
unsupported steel canopy is a technical masterpiece.
However, Hitler's “World Airport” was never completed. Preparations for the war impeded its completion. The rooftop grandstands, where tens of thousands of people were supposed to watch air shows, were never erected. To this day, 13 stairwells remain in an unfinished state – and the air traffic was handled by the old airport from the 1920s. On the new premises, forced labourers were used to produce armaments for the war machine.
The allied aircraft repeatedly attacked Tempelhof and damaged the airport. The Red Army occupied the premises at the end of the war and shortly afterwards it was handed over to the Americans.
Airlift around the clock
With the end of the Second World War, the differences between the superpowers evolved into the cold war. The first high point was the Berlin Blockade.
When the USA also allowed the introduction of the D-Mark in West Berlin, the Soviet Union responded by blockading part of the city on 24 June 1948. Two million inhabitants and the allied occupying forces were suddenly cut off without adequate supplies.
But the USA didn’t give up on West Berlin. On 26 June 1948, the first aircraft already landed in Tempelhof with relief supplies. For eleven months the Allies sent supplies to West Berlin via an 
airlift. Planes carrying food, medicine, and heating material landed in Tempelhof almost every two minutes around the clock.
The pilots repeatedly brought sweets with them. The American pilot Gail Halvorsen is said to have started a special tradition: he made small parachutes, tied them to the sweets and threw them to the waiting children after landing. As a result, the American aircraft came to be known as Candy Bombers.
On 12 May 1949, the Soviet Union lifted the Berlin Blockade due to the lack of success and Tempelhof Airport became an international symbol of the free West.

West Berlin's gateway to the world
It was only in divided Berlin that Tempelhof Airport fulfilled its real task. When the USA opened it to civil air transport in 1951, it became Germany's biggest airport for several years. The war damage was repaired, extensions were added – and Tempelhof was completed in 1962.
The aeroplane provided the only secure connection between the Federal Republic of Germany and West Berlin, which gave Tempelhof a particular importance. But above all, the international airport of the island city brought glamour: in the 1960s, film stars, athletes, and celebrities presented themselves on the gangways and directors such as Billy Wilder used it as a film set (“One, Two, Three”).
In 1970, the airport was given a new terminal building and in the following year, six million passengers used it for the first time.
Minor role and new ways

However, political and technical developments brought this era to an end. Not only did the 1972 Basis of Relations Treaty between the GDR and the Federal Republic of Germany make it possible to travel across the GDR by car or train on a transit route, but jet planes became an accepted means of air transportation. However, the Tempelhof airfield was too small to accommodate them so West Berlin had to rely on the new airport in Tegel and the airlines relocated. By 1975, Tempelhof was only being used by the United States Air Force.
In 1982, the air force of the USA built the distinctive radar tower with its geodesic dome on four legs. Smaller civil aircraft gradually started flying to Tempelhof again, especially after the German reunification. In 2008, the airport closed its doors for the last time.
Today, the airport building serves as a venue for major events and trade fairs. In a referendum in 2014, Berliners rejected the plan to build on the airfield, preferring instead to use the Tempelhofer Feld as a huge inner-city park.",,,"Industrial Architecture

The building - a historic place of change
Nikolai Church has transformed repeatedly during its history. Today the distinctive double tower dominates the skyline. Constructed in red brick at the end of the 19th century, bombing raids in 1944 destroy the Nikolai Church and district almost completely. The spires, roof and parts of the vault are lost. In 1969, the building passes to the Berlin municipal authorities, and both church and municipal rooms are reconstructed in the 80s. The reconstruction of Berlin's 750-year old monument is completed in 1987. If you enter Nikolai Church today, you can once again marvel at the Gothic interior with its distinctive, colourful roof.
In the course of its history, the church has not only been a place of Christian worship but also serves the citizens of Berlin as a municipal centre. Throughout history, it has been the scene of important historical events. Paul Gerhardt, theologian and author of several famous hymns, is rectorate here in the 17th century. 1809 sees the first municipal decrees passed in the church. The first freely elected public representatives are sworn in here in 1991 to celebratory peals of the church bells. Speaking of music: Nikolai remains a place for music lovers, holding regular organ concerts.

From an entertainment district to a shopping area: the history of Friedrichstraße

Friedrichstraße is named after Elector Friedrich III, who ruled here from 1688 to 1713. In his day, the road was surrounded only by fields, pastures and farmland – until the royal estates were sold and work started on building Berlin’s suburbs with paved roads.
By the time of the Second World War, with music halls, theatres and the famous Wintergarten variety theatre, Friedrichstraße had become Berlin’s most famous – and notorious – amusement district.
The Friedrichstraße becomes the border 
When Berlin was partitioned, the wall cut through Friedrichstraße as well. Today at this exact spot – the Checkpoint Charlie border crossing – there is a replica of the guard house that you can visit. Another crossing point in GDR times was Friedrichstraße station. In the glass pavilion – known as the Tränenpalast, or palace of tears – there is an exhibition on the border crossing.
Strolling and shopping in the Friedrichstraße
Building projects after reunification turned the section of Friedrichstraße between the station and Checkpoint Charlie into a popular shopping district. Today, there are many new buildings such as the Friedrichstadtpassagen with designer boutiques, offices and restaurants.

Berlin",52.5152486,13.3980084,Architecture,2,FALSE,Friedrichswerdersche Kirche,Schinkel’s imposing church is always worth a look.,,,"When talking about the city’s most famous architect, Berliners used to say there was a Schinkel building on every corner. An in Mitte at least, it’s still true today, even if many of his religious buildings, like the Friedrichswerdersche Kirche, are no longer used as churches. The Friedrichswerdersche Kirche is an exhibition space for sculptures from the Schinkel period.

The history of the church
The Friedrichswerdersche Kirche is situated at Werderscher Markt – not far from the Humboldtforum, the Rotes Rathaus and the Foreign Ministry. Karl Friedrich Schinkel had left his romantic nationalist “Sturm und Drang” period with all its Gothic cathedral designs long behind him by 1821, when he planned the reconstruction of the dilapidated Franco-German church. Schinkel’s design was based on the Gothic style of English chapels and incorporated Classical elements. The interior of the church, with its groups of pillars rising to a very high ceiling with reticulated vaults, followed Gothic principles.

Architectural history
The church was built between 1824 and 1831 and was Berlin’s first Neo-Gothic church. As early as 1843, Schinkel’s successor Friedrich August Stüler was commissioned to make the church even more Gothic, and embellished the two towers with pinnacles and cast zinc crocketed spires.
For more than a hundred years, the church was used by the Lutheran community. It was badly damaged in the Second World War, and stood as a ruin for four decades, with its stained-glass windows put in storage and forgotten. The crates containing the long-lost windows were lost until 1982, when the water was pumped out of the cellar vaults of the Berliner Dom.

The sculpture exhibition
For Berlin’s 750th anniversary, the Friedrichswerdersche Kirche was turned into a museum, an affiliate department of the Alte Nationalgalerie. Its nave is an atmospheric backdrop to an exhibition of sculpture from Schinkel’s time.

Berlin",52.5012463,13.2741797,Architecture,2,FALSE,ICC - Internationales Congress Centrum Berlin,Temporarily closed. - Completely out of this world – the aluminium façade of the ICC Berlin is reminiscent of the starfighters from Star Wars films.,,,"Celebrated – and ridiculed – for its unusual appearance: the building, which opened in 1979, seems somewhat outdated. The ICC was built in the high-tech architectural style that became popular in the seventies. Its steel and glass buildings are characterised by an aesthetic style that reveals the function of the building parts.

International clout
West Berlin, 1970: the Congress Hall in Tiergarten, the so-called pregnant oyster, finally became too small. It could only accommodate a maximum of 1,200 people, which meant West Berlin was no longer able to keep up as an international congress location.

In 1966, AMK (Ausstellungs-, Messe-, Kongress-GmbH) held a competition to design a multi-purpose hall with a capacity for approx. 4,000 people. The winning design came from a young, still unknown husband-and-wife architect team: Ralf Schüler and Ursulina Schüler-Witte.

Prior to being carried out it became clear that a mere multi-purpose hall was not a solution for the future challenges. At the end of the 1960s, tourism experts predicted a steady increase in the number of congresses, which were a profitable source of income. West Berlin wanted to redefine itself as a congress city and needed an appropriate conference centre.

In the end it turned into a mammoth project. The construction costs amounted to almost one billion marks. In 1979, the ICC thus replaced the State Library, which had just opened a year earlier, as the most expensive new building in West Berlin.

Parallel to the ICC, the Palace of the Republic was being built in East Berlin, a prestigious GDR building that needed to be countered. The ICC was intended to symbolise the superiority of the social market economy and contribute to boosting the economy of West Berlin, which was still isolated at the time.

Spaceship launch
Ralf Schüler and Ursulina Schüler-Witte were commissioned to build the conference centre. They designed an enormous building: 313 metres long, 89 metres wide, 40 metres high.

Slightly more than 20,000 participants can be accommodated at major events here. It has a total of 80 conference rooms, ranging from seven to 6,000 square metres each. The auditorium can hold up to 5,000 people, and Hall 2 around 4,000 visitors.

The ICC stands out due to its sheer dimensions alone and belongs to the few large buildings built in the high-tech architectural style.

The building also impresses with its machine-like appearance: futuristic, in keeping with the growing enthusiasm for technology in the 1970s. This can be clearly seen in the framework-like construction that runs along the façade. It supports the statics of the conference centre and evokes associations with construction site scaffolding.

The construction work started in 1975, six years after the first moon landing. It was therefore no wonder that the voluminous building with its shape and aluminium façade was called a spaceship. It became a popular postcard motif and landmark of future-oriented West Berlin.

Endowed with retro charm
The ICC had state-of-the-art technology at its opening: 8,000 chairs in the conference rooms were equipped with interpretation equipment for up to eight languages. Participants could talk into a microphone from any seat.

Staircases and foyers impressed with their futuristic elements: geometric Op-Art carpets and an innovative guidance system consisting of red and blue fluorescent tubes. Most of the original interior elements are still preserved today and possess a certain retro charm.

A three-storey bridge leads across the Messedamm to the exhibition grounds. This enables conference and trade fair participants to walk back and forth between the building complexes in comfort.

The design was a complete success. For over 30 years, ICC Berlin was the most important conference centre in Germany. It received many awards in the 1980s and 2000s, such as the World Travel Award.

The end or a new beginning?
Despite its popularity, the technology in the ICC Berlin was getting a bit long in the tooth. Another problem was the asbestos pollution.

The last event took place in 2014. But the ICC was still not completely redundant: the State of Berlin used it as an emergency shelter for refugees from 2015 to 2017, and was commissioned to develop a concept for its continued use.

Our tips for nearby the ICC

The Futurium motivates its guests to explore different future perspectives and possibilities in a playful way: various scenarios, an exhibition, a future laboratory and a forum for dialogue and discussion invite them to develop their own attitude.",,,"The Futurium in the heart of the capital hosts an exhibition with vivid scenarios, an interactive hands-on laboratory, and an event forum as a place of dialogue all under one roof. It offers space for exciting discussions, debate, exploration, creative workshops and visionary ideas. Discover, discuss, try it out – the Futurium gives its visitors a glance into the world of tomorrow. It presents the challenges of the future and the various building blocks with which the future can be shaped.  The Futurium is also a place for encounters: politics, science, business and society come together here to exchange ideas about the future. All of this is available on 3,200 square metres spanning three floors.

How do we want to live?
This is the name of the extraordinary exhibition on the upper floor. Various thinking spaces on the topics of mankind, nature and technology present models and possibilities to the visitors* and invite them to reflect on controversial ideas about the future. How will someone live and work in ten or twenty years? How will people in the future be able to feed themselves and what forms of energy will they use? Visitors are invited to discover different options for the future and decide for themselves which one they prefer – and how they can shape it.

Futurium Lab
Touch, participate, test it out. In the basement, visitors of all ages can take possession of objects that will shape our future. Here, one is allowed to touch everything that will shape our future. New technologies like 3D printers and laser cutters are available for anyone to discover – any participant can even turn their own ideas into products right away. For example, visitors can check out the test kitchen to see if insects will be their diet of tomorrow, program some software together with a hackathon team, or test surprising prototypes. Everyone is invited to participate, with or without previous knowledge and can present his ideas in the showcase.

Workshops and Events
Meet experts, listen to visionaries, discuss paths to a liveable future, and develop creative ideas with others – the Futurium offers space for all of this on the ground floor. The event forum will dive deep into the topics explored in the Future exhibition, and will provide stimulus for shaping the future. Everything is possible, and diversity is expressly encouraged. In addition, there will be workshops that focus on virtual reality and 3D printing.
Guided tours for families and children are offered to give a broad overview.

See the gardens of the world with your own eyes.",,,"A Korean tea ceremony, a Japanese cherry blossom festival, and everything else you've ever wanted to know about gardening and horticulture around the world. Welcome to the Gardens of the World! Stroll through the Chinese Garden of the Recovered Moon as you make your way to the tropical paradise of Bali, move from Italy to England in a short walk, all in a massive green oasis in the heart of Berlin's Marzahn district.

Discovering the world's cultures through their gardens

The extensive Marzahn Recreational Park, today better known as the ""Gardens of the World"", was opened by the East Berlin city government in 1987 to commemorate the city's 750th anniversary. Over the years, Japanese, Balinese, Middle Eastern, Korean and Christian-themed gardens have been added, as well as the Italian Renaissance Garden and the Chinese Garden of the Recovered Moon. The last is Germany's largest Chinese garden and marks the reunification of the city of Berlin, with the moon considered symbolic of the perfect harmony and unity of the world according to Chinese teaching. The plants bloom year-round in the Karl-Foerster Perennial Garden.

The Gardens of the World in East Berlin is one of the most beautiful idylls of the city and an oasis for the soul. If you're still craving more after all those fascinating plants, streams, and temples, check out the maze garden and the hedge labyrinth.

Events at Gardens of the World

The Gardens of the World offer not only the complete world of gardening on an area of ​​about 40 hectares. In addition to walks, you can also enjoy gastronomic delights, such as tea ceremonies in authentic Chinese, Japanese, and Korean tea houses. For weddings and events, you can book the reception hall in the Oriental Garden and the Stone Boat in the Chinese Garden.

The Gardens of the World are the stage for many other events each year: the Cherry Blossom Festival each spring, the Chinese Moon Festival with sparkling lanterns in late summer, and Viva la Musica with concerts and fireworks. As part of the International Garden Exhibition (IGA) held here in 2017, a modern open-air stage with up to 5,000 seats was also built here. The scenery could hardly be more beautiful. The employees of the park also offer guided tours through the gardens for plant enthusiasts and those interested in culture.

International Garden Exhibition Berlin 2017 (IGA Berlin 2017)

The IGA was held in the Gardens of the World, neighbouring Kienberg Park, and the nearby Wuhle Valley from April to October 2017. The exhibition was devoted to the future of urban greenscapes. The IGA cableway also allows you to take a look at the Gardens of the World from a bird's-eye view.

The Balinese Garden of the Three Harmonies was expended to include an energy-efficient tropics house for the IGA. It offers visitors and Berliners an interesting destination year-round, but especially in the winter months. The construction of the large tropics house is also a technical achievement because it requires no heating. Water at 45°C flows throughout the structure and keeps the structure a summery 24°C year-round.

Accessibility at Gardens of the World

For people with visual impairments and mobility constraints, the Gardens of the World offer a free escort service. The staff also lend free wheelchairs and toilets are also accessible.

The Gardens of the World were the first permanent park in the country to receive the Signet Accessibility Award for the marketing of its accessible offerings.

Information for school groups

For school classes, the Gardens of the World offer guided tours targeted to different age groups. In 90 minutes, pupils can explore the gardens on different topics with or without questionnaires.

Wuhletal Neighbourhood Tip

The Wuhletal with the Gardens of the World has long been the longest green area in all of ​​Berlin. The river valley runs for almost 20 kilometres! Enjoy the comfortable hiking trails as you stroll past orchards and lakes up to the Kienberg, Biesdorfer Höhe, or the Ahrensfelder Hills.

Please note that the tropical hall and the maze are temporarily closed.

In the heart of Potsdam, not far from the Barberini Museum, a new tower is being built.
In 2018, visitors marvel at the spectacular foundation work: 38 bored piles are turned at a depth of 38 metres to lay the foundations for the new 90-metre-high building with four full storeys and a tower hood.
The tower base with the two side wings and the mezzanine floor will be completed in spring 2021. The height of the tower construction site is currently just under 30 meters.
The decision to rebuild the tower is based on the turbulent history of the Garrison Church, in which both the Prussian Monarchy and the Nazi dictatorship left their mark. First built by Friedrich Wilhelm I for the members of the court and the garrison, the first freely elected town councillors met in the Garrison Church from 1809. Calvinists and Lutherans formed the first union here in 1817. The tomb of the Garrison Church served the Prussian rulers Frederick William I and Frederick II as a burial ground. In 1933, the Garrison Church became sadly famous when Adolf Hitler was confirmed by Reich President Paul von Hindenburg as Reich Chancellor by handshake on the ""Day of Potsdam"".  
As a place of remembrance of German history and as a forum for peace and reconciliation, a 
space of encounter is created here, where the debate about arrogance and fall, about resistance and adaptation, and about freedom and oppression is to be brought to life.
The idea of reconciliation accompanies the reconstruction project from the very beginning: The temporary Nail Cross Chapel on the edge of the construction site unites historical traces with the church and socio-political discourses.
Baroque style meets modern functionality
The new tower design of the architects Hilmer, Sattler & Albrecht shows an exciting symbiosis of reconstruction and modern functionality. Exhibition and seminar areas as well as the central chapel as the heart of the tower will be built on an area of about 1200 sqm. A highlight will be the 57-metre-high viewing platform with a wide view over Potsdam. The historic carillon under the almost 90-metre-high tower dome will also sound again.
The nearly 90 meter high building will have four full storeys, 365 steps and an elevator. Accessible construction is the order of the day.

The Nail Cross Chapel
At the edge of the construction site, the temporarily erected Nail Cross Chapel invites you to church services, exhibitions and lots of historical information. As a member of the Coventry Nail Cross Community, three steps form the basis of church life: remembering history, learning responsibility and living reconciliation.

Responses to these exciting questions are found at Berlin's museum for communication, the oldest Postal Museum in the world, with a focus on the complex changes of the information society. From Morse code to interactive robots, its exhibits tell the story of communication in vivid and tangible terms.

Experimenting with communication at the 'Postkolosseum'
The Museum für Kommunikation forms part of the Museum Foundation for post and telecommunications. Its predecessor is the Postal Museum. Emperor Wilhelm I opens the 1874 building which houses a collection charting the history of the postal system. In 1895, Ernst Wenck completes a sculpture of giants spanning the globe, symbolising the importance of the postal service for mankind, it is seen on the roof. The imposing appearance of the giants lead Berliners to jokingly refer to the building as the 'Post Colosseum'. Bombing raids destroy large parts of the premises during the Second World War. During the 1950s, the GDR government begins to rebuild the museum, attaching particular importance to faithful reconstruction. The modern extension and redevelopment begin in the 1990s with architectural preservation works. In March 2000, the space is finally reopened under the name Museum für Kommunikation. The sculpture of the giants now perched on the roof is a true replica of the original.

The new exhibition aims to chart the development of communication from various angles through interactive experiences. This concern is evident even from the building's exterior: a historical façade is joined by neon lettering and a sound collage of everyday noises, music and voices. Enter the building, and the vast atrium throws you back into Imperial Berlin. You are then immediately thrust forward in time as a speaking robot welcomes you inside. On entering the exhibition, you see the Gallery of Communications where you can experiment with smoke signals and message transmission routes via cable and tin can telephones. In the green-screen studio, you play director and edit digital video clips. From here you can upload your films to YouTube. On the first floor, there are special themed rooms on the postal serive and writing culture, as well as television and radio. The stamp collection is one of the most unique collections on the world. The Treasure Chamber in the cellar keeps its promise: mystical futuristic designs adorn the most extraordinary objects in the collection. Travel with astronauts into space and back in the Dark Rooms exhibition which features the 'Cosmos stamp', the world's first telephone and the famous Blue Mauritius.

The Synagoge Rykestraße survived the Nazis and the war almost unscathed.,,,"The second-biggest Jewish place of worship in Europe not only survived survived the Nazis and the Second World War largely undamaged, but also the general neglect of the area in the GDR. Berlin’s largest synagogue, near Kollwitzplatz, has a history to be proud of.

The history of the Synagoge Rykestraße: another synagogue for Berlin
The expansion of the Jewish community in Berlin at the beginning of the 20th century made it necessary to build another large synagogue in the city. The architect Johann Hoeniger designed the building in the Neo-Romanesque style. After 10 months of construction it was ceremonially inaugurated in 1904. The synagogue in Prenzlauer Berg still has room for 2000 worshippers today.

The front building of the Rykestraße synagogue is also a place of learning. In the beginning, it was purely a religious school, then a primary school opened in 1922, followed a few years later by a private school for the Jewish community. One of the teachers there was Lilli Henoch, holder of several athletics world records.

When the Nazis took power in 1933 the teaching and activities at the Jewish school association changed focus. From this time on there was increased interest in preparing the pupils for Aliyah, emigration to Palestine to escape from the fascist regime.

After the November Pogrom
Of course, the synagogue in Rykestraße was in the sights of the Nazis on 9 November 1938. Its location in a densely populated urban residential area meant that the Nazis were unable to burn it down. They destroyed the interior of the building instead. In April 1940 the building was confiscated and used by the Wehrmacht as stables and a storehouse. The synagogue survived the Second World War bombing raids without any lasting damage.

Reopening
After extensive renovation, the building was dedicated again by Rabbi Martin Riesenburger in 1953. When Germany and Berlin were divided, the synagogue became the centre of Jewish life in East Berlin. A three-year renovation project from 2004 to 2007 was headed by Ruth Golan and Kay Zareh, with the aim of making the original condition of the synagogue in 1904 visible again. The project – financed by many sponsors – was completed in 2007 and the synagogue was reopened with a ceremony to bring in the Torah rolls.

The Gedenkstätte Deutscher Widerstand commemorates them.,,,"On the morning of 20 July 1944, Claus von Stauffenberg flew to a meeting at the Wolf’s Lair, Hitler’s military headquarters in East Prussia. In his briefcase, he had a bomb to kill Hitler and bring down the Nazi regime. The attempt failed. The very same night, shortly after midnight, Stauffenberg and his co-conspirators were executed in the courtyard of the Bendlerblock in Berlin.
At this place today, the Gedenkstätte Deutscher Widerstand commemorates not only Stauffenberg, but also all the other courageous people and groups who resisted the Nazis. Since 1953, the courtyard has been a place of remembrance. The exhibition and educational centre were opened in 1968.
A place that shaped history: the Bendlerblock
The Bendlerblock is a building complex that was constructed from 1911 to 1914 for the imperial German navy. After the First World War, the newly established ministry of defence also moved into the buildings. Under the Nazis, several departments of the naval high command and the foreign and defence office were housed in the Bendlerblock. Also based here was the supreme high command of the German army, where General Friedrich Olbricht plotted a coup against Hitler.
Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg had been a staff officer at Olbricht’s office since 1943 and attended military briefings at the Wolf’s Lair, Hitler’s military headquarters in East Prussia. On 20 July 1944 he carried out an assassination attempt there, but Hitler survived the explosion and the coup failed. That very same night, Stauffenberg, along with Olbricht and fellow resistance members Albrecht Mertz von Quirnheim and Werner von Haeften were executed in the courtyard of the Bendlerblock, which is now a memorial to them.
Commemorations of the resistance
On 20 July 1952 the foundation stone was laid for a memorial in the courtyard. A year later, the mayor of Berlin, Ernst Reuter, unveiled the memorial. On 20 July 1968, an educational and memorial centre opened, with a permanent exhibition on the military resistance to the Nazis. In the late 1980s, at the initiative of the then mayor, Richard von Weizsäcker, the memorial centre was extended to commemorate not only Stauffenberg’s plot, but all those in Germany who resisted national socialism.
The exhibition was updated in 2014, and now includes 1000 photographs and documents showing the resistance among the labour movement, the church, artists and intellectuals, Jews, Sinti and Roma, as well as the ‘silent helpers’ who came to the aid of Jews and refugees in hiding. The exhibition shows how these peoples’ resistance developed, what motivated them and how they formed networks. Other episodes include Georg Elser’s assassination attempt in November 1939, the Kreisau Circle, the White Rose and the Red Orchestra. You can not only find out about the resistance of these people and groups, but also the Nazi dictatorship’s ruthless response to the actions of the resistance.

People jumping out of windows into sheets held out by West Berlin firemen – images of Bernauer Straße in August 1961 were seen all over the world. Today this historic location is the site of the Berlin Wall Memorial where the partition of Berlin is remembered.

Memorial and documentation centre

The large open air exhibition on the former border strip covers four areas with historical audio materials and pictures, a visitors’ centre and an observation tower. There is a 70-metre stretch on the Berlin Wall with border strip and watchtower directly on Bernauer Straße. The installation shows how the border was set up at the end of the 80s and gives visitors the lasting impression of the construction that once divided a country.

The exhibition in the documentation centre is on the other side of Bernauer Straße and shows the history of the construction of the wall in 1961. You can take a look at the remaining parts of the border crossing from a five-storey observation tower.

There is also a Chapel of Reconciliation on the site. The former Church of Reconciliation was demolished in 1985 as it was directly on the border strip. Visitors to services in the new chapel regularly remember the victims of the Wall. The Window of Memorial on the site portrays the 130 people who were shot or died on the Berlin Wall.


A look back: Bernauer Straße as the scene where history was made

Bernauer Straße, on the boundary between the districts of Wedding and Mitte, became a historical site with the erection of the Wall. The Berlin Wall was erected here in August 1961 directly in front of the East Berlin houses. Some residents decided to take flight at the last minute and used ropes to climb out their windows. Others were forced to move out and the windows of their flats were bricked over. The picture of the GDR soldier Conrad Schumann, who jumped over the barbed wire two days after the division of Berlin, is still famous today. Over the years the East Berliners constructed numerous escape tunnels around Bernauer Straße. When the partition of the city was finally over the first segments were broken off the Berlin Wall in the night from the 10th to the 11th of November 1989 in Bernauer Straße.

Information for schools

The Berlin Wall memorial offers tours and seminars for schools as well as three- to four-hour bicycle tours along the former border strip from April to September. Pupils over the age of 16 can take part in moderated discussions with witnesses.","(additional information)

This gallery within the Kulturforum (Culture Forum) displays priceless paintings from the Middle Ages and the early modernist period: works by Rubens, Biblical motifs by Botticelli or astonishingly vibrant portraits by Albrecht Dürer.

Art in the best light
The Gemäldegalerie opens in 1830. From the outset, visitors can see masterpieces here, including works by great artists such as Rembrandt and Botticelli. The collection loses many of its pieces to fire and misplacement during World War II, and with the division of Berlin, the Gemäldegalerie collection is also separated. Today, it's been reunited in the new museum building at the Kulturforum. The Museum showcases a permanent collection of 1,400 artworks. A tour takes you across more than two kilometres, featuring 18 rooms and 41 cabinets. The gallery has a simple and modern design, and every room has a different coloured wall, providing the perfect background for the paintings. All rooms lead to the central foyer, which features a water installation by Walter De Maria. This central space is perfect for a short meditative rest.

Take a look at the ceilings in each room: you will notice that all the paintings are lit only by daylight, so the artworks almost appear to radiate their own light. One of these works is 'Amor Vincit Omnia' by Caravaggio; the winged boy is typical of the style of this master. Or 'Madonna in the Church' by Jan van Eyck: the Madonna, clothed in a crown and fine dress, bears the baby Jesus in a Gothic church. The painting with two monkeys is also famous. They sit chained, looking down upon a 16th-century port. The painting's creator was Pieter Bruegel the Elder, and it is entitled 'Two Chained Monkeys'. Even today, art critics are undecided over its meaning. Take time to see the famous paintings by Sandro Botticelli. Many of the women in his paintings are reminiscent of one of his most famous works, the 'Birth of Venus'. The same applies to the image 'Madonna with Child', and 'The Virgin and Child Enthroned'. Thomas Gainsborough captures the vitality of children in his portrait of the four Marsham siblings in 'The Marsham Children'. Try to decipher Bruegel's 'The Netherlandish Proverbs' - around 100 sayings are depicted in the painting. In the Gemäldegalerie, you also have the unique opportunity to see a work by Georges de La Tour. 'Peasant Couple Eating' is the only one of his works to hang in a German museum. One of the most famous paintings in the collection is 'The Man with the Golden Helmet'. Long considered one of Rembrandt's masterpieces, scholars now believe that it is in fact the work of another painter from his circle.

Together with the Deutscher Dom it graces Berlin’s most beautiful public square, Gendarmenmarkt.

Together with its twin building the Konzerthaus it graces Gendarmenmarkt. The Französischer Dom and the Deutscher Dom with their striking domed towers are the reason why Gendarmenmarkt is considered Berlin’s most beautiful square – and it’s something you mustn’t miss. At the same time, the buildings are evidence in stone of successful integration and religious tolerance.

Although the word “Dom” means cathedral in German, the Französischer Dom is not a church. Because actually it is two buildings. The Französischer Dom is only the splendid domed tower of the building, housing the Huguenot Museum and the viewing platform. The lower part of the building is the actual church, the Französische Friedrichstadtkirche.  

History of the Französischer Dom
The Französischer Dom gets its name from the French word for “dome” and the history of its construction. In 1701 work began on building a church for the French Protestant community, which was completed in 1705. Many French Protestants, known as Huguenots, had fled to Prussia after Elector Friedrich Wilhelm offered them safe refuge with the Edict of Potsdam.  

In 1785, Friedrich II commissioned Karl von Gontard and then later Christian Ungers to add magnificent towers to the two churches. They were simply embellishment without any particular function. During the Second World War, bombing raids destroyed the buildings at Gendarmenmarkt. They remained ruins for a long time, until reconstruction finally began in 1981. The first service was held in the restored church at Easter 1983. The tower with its viewing balustrade and carillon opened in 1987 for Berlin’s 750th anniversary celebrations.

Französische Friedrichstadtkirche
In keeping with the traditions of the reformed church, the interior is kept plain and simple. There are no pictures and no altar. Even so, its curved ceiling arches lend it a simple elegance. The only opulent decoration is the sumptuous organ with its golden spiked corona.  

Concerts
The Französische Friedrichstadtkirche is one of Berlin’s most important venues for church music. Concerts of the highest quality are regularly held here. As well as the weekly organ concerts, the church is also an atmospheric backdrop to concerts put on by other organisers.

Carillon
The carillon consists of 60 brass bells, and is the second largest carillon in the city after the one in the Tiergarten.

Church services
Services are held every Sunday at 9.30 and 11 o’clock. At 11 o’clock there is also a service in French in the Georges Casalis Room.

The Huguenot Museum
The Huguenot museum opened in 1935, and provides a fascinating insight into the story of the Huguenots in France and Berlin. The highlight of the exhibition is the Edict of Potsdam, which guaranteed them freedom to practise their reformed faith.

Berlin",52.5137224,13.3926698,Architecture,2,FALSE,Gendarmenmarkt,The most beautiful square in Berlin? The most beautiful north of the Alps? Take a look for yourself at Gendarmenmarkt.,,,"Once, soldiers matched here, but today Berliners and tourists stroll across the square. It’s said to be the most beautiful public square in Berlin, and perhaps the most beautiful north of the Alps. The ensemble of the concert house and two church buildings embellished with towers is in perfect harmony. In summer, orchestras play the most beautiful classical melodies at the Classic Open Air, and in winter the square transforms into a winter wonderland with a Christmas market.

The history of Gendarmenmarkt
The Friedrichstadt quarter was built by Friedrich I at the end of the 17th century according to plans by Johann Arnold Nering. Its main residents were Huguenot refugees from France, which is why the French Protestant community was given one church on the square, and the Lutheran congregation the other. The square got its name from the “Gens d’armes” cuirassier regiment, whose stables there were demolished by Friedrich II. Between the two churches, a new theatre, now known as the Konzerthaus Berlin, was built.

Right in the middle of the square, in front of the Konzerthaus, is a statue of the poet Friedrich Schiller. It was not until twelve years after the foundation stone was laid that the monument was unveiled. After the Second World War, the square lay in ruins. In the 1970s, the East Berlin government had it rebuilt in its current form. Having been renamed Platz der Akademie in 1950, Gendarmenmarkt got its old name back in 1991 after reunification.

A dome, not a church
Gendarmenmarkt took on its current form under Friedrich II – with a harmonious architectural ensemble planned by Georg Christian Unger. Carl von Gontard embellished both the Französische Friedrichstadtkirche and the Lutheran church with almost over-dimensioned domed towers. Although the towers are called the Deutscher Dom and the Französischer Dom (“Dom” means “cathedral” in German), they are not churches. They are simply called that after the French word for a dome.  

The Deutscher Dom now houses the Bundestag’s exhibition on German parliamentary history Milestones – Setbacks – Sidetracks. The Path to Parliamentary Democracy in Germany. The Französischer Dom contains the Huguenot Museum. The lower part of the building is still the Französische Friedrichstadtkirche.

A famous resident – E.T.A. Hoffmann
The poet E.T.A. Hoffmann once lived here, and he recorded city life in his story My Cousin’s Corner Window. He liked to spend his time in the Lutter & Wegner wine tavern, where his actor friend Ludwig Devrient is said to have unintentionally invented the German word for sparkling wine, “Sekt”. Today, the wine tavern is only two street corners away from the original building.

Classic Open Air
Every summer, Gendarmenmarkt is the romantic setting for the Classic Open Air series of concerts. On the steps of the Konzerthaus, the orchestras play lively classics while the sun slowly sets on a balmy summer’s evening.  (No concerts in 2020)

It tells of the history of Protestant religious refugees from France and the economical and cultural enrichment they brought to Berlin, Brandenburg and Prussia. The starting point for this development is the Reformation, when a Protestant minority emerges in France. Pursued by the King and Catholic clergy, many Huguenots flee during the 16th century to Prussia, where the local nobility promised them protection. Elector Friedrich Wilhelm of Brandenburg welcomes around 20,000 refugees with his edict of 1685. Französischer Dom, built at the beginning of the 18th century, is an important meeting place for displaced persons. From 1780 to 1785, King Frederick II of Prussia uses it to flaunt his regal splendour. 150 years later, the Cathedral is dedicated to the Huguenot Museum. You'll find many historic exhibits revelatory of Huguenot life.

French-German friendship at the Gendarmenmarkt
In the heart of historic Friedrichstadt, the French Cathedral is located on the north side of the Gendarmenmarkt square. Formally a school and residence, the Huguenot Museum in the Französischer Dom is established in 1935. An antique-style gable forms a large columned portal. Inside, you discover the vivid history of the Huguenots. In five rooms and six tower niches, you find precious exhibits like the original edict of Potsdam. The honorary bust of its author, Prince-elector Friedrich Wilhelm of Brandenburg, immediately catches the eye as you enter the museum. Many of the other exhibits in the museum date from his time: old paintings and documents, medals and manuscripts. Even historic stained glass windows from a French Calvinist Church. There is also information about famous Huguenots in Germany, like the painter Nikolaus Daniel Chodowiecki and poet Theodor Fontane. The exhibition also charts the construction of the Französischer Dom and the adjacent Friedrichstadtkirche. A historical library with valuable books compliments the collection.

Deutscher Dom and Mendelssohn Remise: things to do at Gendarmenmarkt
The Deutscher Dom is located on the Gendarmenmarkt's southern side. This almost identical cathedral has been a venue for exhibitions of German history since 1996. In 2002, the Bundestag opens the permanent exhibition ""Wege, Irrwege, Umwege"". Five floors show the history of liberal, parliamentary democracy in Germany. The Mendelssohn Remise is located on Jägerstraße, only 150 metres from the museum. The former headquarters of the Mendelssohn Bank is dedicated to the cultural heritage of this bourgeois family. Philosopher Moses Mendelssohn is regarded as the founder of this dynasty. One of his grandsons is the famous composer Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy. In the Remise, you will gain insight into Prussian-Jewish life and the impressive cultural legacy of this family.

Our tips for your visit

As the only artist's studio in Berlin from the 1920s to be open to the public, the listed ensemble is a living testimony to this era.",,,"Each year, the museum uses its 400 m² of exhibition space to host three to four special shows a year related to current contemporary art or to classical modernism, mostly with a focus on sculpture (including the likes of Auguste Rodin, Hans Arp, and Renée Sintenis).
New Objectivity
The museum in Berlin's Westend district is located in two adjacent buildings that were the home and studio of artist Georg Kolbe (1877-1947). Built between 1928 and 1929 in the style of New Objectivity, it is no coincidence that they are reminiscent of works by such major architects as Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius. Georg Kolbe had these two cubic brick buildings connected by a park-like garden with an old stand of pine as a home for him and his family. The museum presents its exhibitions in Kolbe's former sculptor's studio, which not only features a large skylight, but also the rails that the artist could use to move heavy pieces he was working on. Kolbe's living room is now home to the museum's front desk and the museum shop is housed in the former dining room, where the original furniture is also still preserved.
Berlin Secession
Georg Kolbe was the most successful German sculptor in the first half of the 20th century. His expressive sculptures, some of which can be seen in the museum gardens and in nearby Georg-Kolbe-Hain park, reflect the zeitgeist of Berlin as a centre of art at the turn of the last century. Particularly revealing for an understanding of their context is their close connection to the now iconic architecture of modernity. Kolbe worked with Walter Gropius, Bruno Taut, Henry van de Velde, Hans Poelzig, and many other modern architects. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, for example, placed ""Morgen"" (""Morning""), Kolbe's sculpture of a female figure with her arms raised to the sun, in the water feature at his legendary Barcelona Pavilion.
As one of the leading members of the Berlin Secession and later the Free Secession, Georg Kolbe had been considered one of the most renowned artists in Germany since the early 20th century. He was friends with Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Ernst Barlach, Renée Sintenis, and many other artists of the period. His sculptures and drawings can now be found in many major museums and public places all over Germany.
The museum's collection, only a part of which is on display at a time, includes works by the artist that were left in his estate as well as his personal art collection (with works by Karl Schmidt-Rottluff, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Auguste Rodin, Aristide Maillol), as well as the partial estates of Renée Sintenis and Richard Scheibe.
An all-round experience
The enchanting museum campus with its numerous sculptures by Kolbe is also a short walk from the Georg-Kolbe-Hain, a park featuring some of teh artist's larger pieces. Also nearby is the scenic Heerstraße Cemetery, where not only Kolbe, but also German comedian Loriot, Horst Buchholz, and Paul Cassirer are buried. In addition, there are a number of famous listed buildings near the museum: other famous villas in the New Objectivity style of the 1920s, the Corbusier House, the Olympic Stadium, and Hans Poelzig's Haus der Rundfunk (Radio House) on Masurenalle with the sculpture ""Nacht"" (""Night"") by Georg Kolbe.

Berlin",52.548187,13.4166344,Architecture,2,FALSE,Gethsemanekirche,The church that changed everything,,,"“The wall must go!” could be heard from the Gethsemanekirche on 5 November 1989. Just one moment in its turbulent history.

On 5 November 1989, the state orchestra was playing Beethoven’s 3rd symphony (Eroica) when the senior musical director of the Komische Oper, Rolf Reuter, demanded “The wall must go!” to rousing applause. This led to a spontaneous demonstration march along Schönhauser Allee. It wasn’t the first time that year that opponents of the East German regime had met and demonstrated in the Gethsemanekirche.

History of the Gethsemanekirche: Berlin 1989
The Protestant Gethsemanekirche is most famous for its role in the peaceful revolution of 1989. On 2 October 1989, members of peace, environmental and church groups called for a vigil in the church in East Berlin. Their reason for this was the arrest of demonstrators in Leipzig in September. More and more people joined the protest and attended the church services every evening. Thousands of candles were lit outside the church and became a symbol of peaceful protest.

When the East German leadership stood down in March 1990, the first and only free elections in the GDR were held, and the newly elected parliament met at the Gethsemanekirche for a commemorative service. The church is still a meeting point for civil movements.

Events: services, concerts and Christmas at the Gethsemanekirche
After the peaceful revolution, the church community in Prenzlauer Berg remained politically active. During the second Gulf war in 1991, for example, prayers for peace were held in the Gethsemanekirche. The congregation still puts on a service every Sunday. Particularly at Christmas, the concerts and the nativity scene attract lots of visitors to the church. The Gethsemanekirche is also a very popular place for christenings and marriages, not only because of its history, but also its architecture.

Architecture and art at the Gethsemanekirche
The church was build from 1891 to 1893 in the area of Prenzlauer Berg now known as the Helmholtz-Kiez, and was designed by August Orth. It is a hall church with a Neo-Gothic brickwork exterior, a spacious interior and a wide, rib-vaulted ceiling. In keeping with 19th century industrial architecture, steel reinforcements support the building. The centre of the building is a large octagon with a stellar vault. The walls are plain white, in attractive contrast to the terracotta pillars.

Important works of art at the Gethsemanekirche include the wooden sculpture Praying Christ, the Benedictive Christ rescued from the Versöhnungskirche on the non-man’s land by the Berlin wall before it was exploded in 1985, and the bronze statue The Spiritual Fighter.

You can also re-explore the axes in the basement of the Libeskind Building with the Garden of Exile and the installation ""Fallen Leaves"" by Menashe Kadishmann in the empty space of memory.

The new ANOHA children's museum is finished, but will open at a later date. The Children's World encourages children to explore and touch everything up close. With the distance and hygiene regulations currently required, this principle cannot be implemented.
Learn, understand and reflect - the Jewish Museum Berlin tells the history of Jews in Germany. When you visit, you find yourself inside an artwork. The whole edifice (inside and out) reflects the museum's subject matter. Architect Daniel Libeskind's building unfurls in zigzagging corridors like a lightening flash, or for some, a broken Star of David. Empty spaces, known as 'voids', appear throughout the building. These voids are not accessible until you reach the Memory Void. They remind visitors of the voids that the Holocaust has left behind.
The Museum, an artwork in itself
The museum's exceptional character strikes you before you even enter. The building's zigzag shapes and sharp angles are disguised in titanium and zinc. Enter via Kollegienhaus, which dates back to the 18th century. This entrance takes you to the ground floor of the Libeskind Building. Here you choose between three divergent axes, corridors symbolic of Jewish life in Germany: exile, Holocaust and continuity. Take the axis of exile to the Garden of Exile. Concrete towers and uneven ground establish a feeling of uncertainty. Olive bushes are present, signifying reassurance in times of need. The Holocaust axis leads to a dark tower. A bare concrete shaft with a narrow slit of light serving as a symbol for hopelessness and abandonment.

More memorials for National Socialism in Berlin
Berlin is home to several sites commemorating the Holocaust and the history of National Socialism. These include the documentation centre, Topography of Terror, lying on land that once housed the headquarters of the SS. It deals with their reign of terror between 1933 and 1945. About a kilometre north is the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. Here, a labyrinth of variously sized concrete squares rise from an undulating concrete sea. The House of the Wannsee Conference is another important memorial site, being the planning location for the genocide of European Jews by the Nazis. Among other things, it holds a media library of documents recording Jewish deportation to Eastern Europe. The T4 Information Centre commemorates the murders of 70,000 disabled people as part of the Nazi's 'euthanasia' programme. The office of the perpetrators, at Tiergartenstraße 4, is marked with a memorial and information on the victims. Only a few metres away on Stauffenbergstraße, you find the Bendlerblock, now the second seat of the Ministry of Defence. Here, a memorial dedicated to the German Resistance is located within a commemorative courtyard for the Stauffenberg resistance.","Opening hours

History of the watchtower at Potsdamer Platz
The so-called “panoramic observation tower” was part of the border troops’ base and of the Ministry for State Security. It was used for monitoring the border strip as well as the ministries close by. The solid, type “BT 6” watchtower with rifle loopholes was built from 1966. At the end of the GDR era, there were more than 200 of these watchtowers on the Berlin border.

A meeting place for the international art scene
In 1877, the construction of a Museum of Applied Arts begins in the German Imperial capital. Architect Martin Gropius and his colleague Heino Schmieden design a building in the Italian Neo-Renaissance style. Four years later, the building is finished, and the collection presented to Berliners. The building sustains major damage during World War II, but in the 1960s its fortunes take a turn for the better. The grandnephew of the founding director of the Bauhaus, Walter Gropius, is vehemently committed to restoring it from a near ruinous state. Gradually refurbished throughout the 1970s, it again serves as an exhibition space. Berliner Festspiele organises exhibitions and concerts on its three levels. Your visit begins where the Berlin Wall once stood. From here, you enter directly into this exceptionally grand historic building. The mosaics and terracotta figurines on the facade are immediately noticeable. The entrance is elegant and stylishly decorated in white, reflecting the contemporary cultural zeitgeist. Immediately afterwards, you come to the heart of the building, a glass-enclosed atrium where the current exhibition is on display. Check out the elaborate mosaics on the floor; they reflect several epochs and branches of the arts and crafts movement. This is the backdrop for objects and installations by contemporary artists such as Ai Weiwei. Other famous names include Frida Kahlo, Olafur Eliasson and David Bowie.

Temporary events sometimes take place in the Gropius Bau, for example JazzFest Berlin or the national competitions of the Berliner Festspiele.

Berlin",52.4297476,13.4715545,Architecture,2,FALSE,Gropiusstadt – Britz-Buckow-Rudow,The satellite city in the south-east of Berlin,,,"In the 1950s, the destruction of the war meant there was a shortage of housing in West Berlin. Outside the city centre, a new, modern housing project was to be built. The choice fell on vacant farmland south of Neukölln, in the districts of Britz, Buckow and Rudow.

On green fields
Britz-Buckow-Rudow, or BBR for short, was to be a satellite city with schools, shops and leisure facilities.

In 1959/60, the West Berlin Senate recruited Walter Gropius, the renowned architect and founder of the Bauhaus in Weimar, to execute the project. Together with The Architects Collaborative (TAC), the architectural firm that he founded, Gropius set about designing a large-scale housing complex.

Open but structured
The draft urban planning for BBR described a “structured and spacious city”. The buildings were to be arranged in neighbourhoods and crossed by green spaces. Residents would be able to use central infrastructure such as the Walter Gropius School.

An extension of the U7 underground line with the new stations Johannisthaler Chaussee, Lipschitzallee, Wutzkyallee and Zwickauer Damm was also part of the concept.

Walter Gropius’s design was inspired by the proximity to the Britz district and Bruno Taut’s famous Hufeisensiedlung. He wanted to create a circle reminiscent of the horseshoe, consisting of twelve high-rise buildings, directly surrounded by rows of terraces and detached houses. None of the buildings were to be higher than five storeys.

Going too high
When the estate was built between 1962 and 1975, it was very different to the way the architect had planned it.

In 1961, not long after the contract was awarded, the Berlin Wall cut the city in two. Building land on the outskirts of West Berlin was suddenly in short supply. The solution was to build upwards. At BBR, many tower blocks were packed into a small space. With 31 storeys, the Ideal Tower is still the tallest residential building in Berlin.

Walter Gropius didn’t live to see the project completed, having died in 1969. The Britz-Buckow-Rudow estate was officially named Gropiusstadt in 1972.

Problems in social housing
Over the decades Gropiusstadt, which was conceived on paper as the ideal satellite city, developed into a much maligned problem neighbourhood.

This was caused by various factors, such as the high density of housing and the tenant structure, and not least the poor quality of the outdoor spaces. In her book “Wir Kinder vom Bahnhof Zoo” Christiane Felscherinow described the dreariness of the place where she grew up. Gropiusstadt gained a bleak reputation in the 1980s.

A lot has changed since then. Major investment in infrastructure since the turn of the millennium has made the area more attractive to new tenants. Since 2014, new houses have been built on the green spaces, and projects to improve accessibility and develop recreational areas will be completed by 2021.

Our tips for Gropiusstadt
Every first Sunday after New Year, the Ideal high-rise block hosts the Tower Run, where competitors run up the 465 steps to the 29th floor. One of the buildings worth seeing in Gropiusstadt is the Walter Gropius School, which opened in 1968. On Baumläuferweg you’ll come across architecture from another century entirely: the Jungfernmühle, built in 1757, is the oldest preserved windmill in Berlin. It was originally situated in Potsdam but arrived via various detours at its present location in Buckow in 1892. Inside it, the Jungfernmühle restaurant welcomes guests – we recommend making a reservation! There are two interesting religious buildings on Lipschitzallee: the protestant Trinity Church built between 1969 and 1971 with its three towering pointed roofs, and the catholic St. Dominicus Church, built from 1975 to 1977 with a unique conical roof.

Berlin",52.5386093,13.2750418,Architecture,2,FALSE,The large Siemensstadt housing estate,"If you take a walk through the large Siemensstadt housing estate, you can directly compare the buildings of the classic modern era.",,,"At the end of the 1920s, Berlin’s city planning officer Martin Wagner commissioned six architects to plan a new residential estate in Charlottenburg-North and Spandau. They were tasked with creating affordable living space for employees of the nearby Siemens plant. Between 1929 and 1934, a total of 1,379 apartments with two or two-and-a-half rooms each were built on the estate.
Of the six architects, four belonged to the progressive group called Der Ring: Walter Gropius, Hans Scharoun, Otto Bartning and Hugo Häring. That’s why the Siemensstadt housing estate is often also referred to today as Ringsiedlung (Ring estate). In addition to the four Ring members, the two architects Fred Forbát and Paul Rudolf Henning also designed buildings for the estate.
A break with conventional construction methods
The most important maxim of this group was to find other architectural and urban development solutions than those of the Gründerzeit. No more block-edge development with gloomy backyards, as otherwise predominated in Berlin. The buildings were intended to provide all tenants with the same conditions: being equal in size, having the same incidence of light and the possibility to soak up the sun and allow in fresh air.
Early on, the six architects agreed to design the estate exclusively in the ribbon development 
construction method, whose basic principle was narrow houses built in a north-south direction and positioned at right angles to roads. The aim was to optimise the incidence of light into the homes while at the same time minimising noise pollution for the residents.
To good neighbourliness
Hans Scharoun was responsible for the overall planning of the Ringsiedlung as regards urban development. He envisaged a completely new type of estate for Berlin in which he could realise his idea of “neighbourliness”. Referring to his design of the large Siemensstadt housing estate, Scharoun himself said in 1927:
“Neighbourliness is a spiritual energy – a quality, not just a quantity. A neighbourhood is a space through which a pedestrian can pass in around a quarter of an hour, a space that corresponds to a child’s joyfulness of experience, large enough to accommodate adventures, yet small enough to create a sense of home.”
In concrete terms: Scharoun pursued the idea of a more relaxed city, with many open spaces. There, residents would find a place of recreation, a place to let their children play, experience a sense of community and feel at home between the buildings which framed their world.
Today you can trace his guiding principle, in particular in the green areas of the estate designed by landscape architect Leberecht Migge. The centrally located park creates a link between the houses and at the same time invites you to linger.
Six individual signatures
During a walk through the large Siemensstadt housing estate, it is worth paying attention to the details. If you look closely, you will see that each of the six architects have added their own 
distinctive touches to their ribbon development.
Each visit to the estate begins with Hans Scharoun’s design. His buildings on Jungfernheideweg form the entrance to the large Siemensstadt housing estate like a funnel. Looking at the buildings, you will notice that Scharoun has borrowed a number of elements from maritime architecture: circular windows reminiscent of portholes, differences in height such as in the decks on board. The building was soon popularly known as the “Panzerkreuzer” (armoured cruiser). In the Siemensstadt housing estate, Scharoun demonstrated his special talent for harmoniously combining unusual shapes. He himself lived in one of the apartments until 1960.
On the western edge of the large Siemensstadt housing estate stands a building that follows completely different aesthetic principles to the “Panzerkreuzer”: Walter Gropius’ functionalist design, which in comparison to Scharoun has an austere and almost cool effect. The only breaking up of the white façades comes from the dark grey colouring of the windows. New Objectivity in pure form.
Otto Bartning’s 338-metre-long building block on the southern edge of the large Siemensstadt housing estate is not built in a north-south direction, but in an east-west direction. The plot of land he was assigned did not allow it any other way. He had to find 
alternative ways to optimise the incidence of light. Bartning solved the problem through spatial arrangement: the bedroom and living room faced the sunny south side, while the kitchen and bathroom were located on the north side. The building’s plain, homogeneous façade was not well received by everyone: Berliners call it the “langer Jammer” (long lamentation).
The importance of colouring is expressed particularly beautifully in Hugo Häring’s buildings. He used building materials in warm brown and ochre tones, which harmonise with the park’s green plants. The most striking feature of his design are the kidney-shaped balconies. They are an expression of Häring’s understanding of organic functionalism. In his architecture, the shapes of the building parts arise from the function they are supposed to fulfil. Due to the unusual floor plan of the balconies, Häring could expand the area to the maximum. At the same time, the shadow cast on the floor below could be minimised.
Fred Forbát’s and Paul Rudolf Henning’s buildings also bear their own distinctive touches. With terraces for his ground floor apartments, Henning put the focus on relaxation in the fresh air. Forbát designed his façades in a clear and geometric manner, but broke them up with brick walls on the stairwells.
 
During the Second World War, some of the buildings in the Siemensstadt housing estate suffered 
severe damage. However, this did not change the overall aesthetic impression of the estate. In the 1950s, several new buildings were added: Hans Scharoun complemented his Jungfernheideweg buildings with a third structure. From 1955 to 1956, Otto Bartning extended his “langer Jammer” with the present house numbers Goebelstraße 11-19. The Goebelstraße 1-9 building, designed by Hans Scharoun at the same time, forms an interesting contrast to the style of the rest of the estate. With pink arcades and brightly painted yellow, red and blue doors, it stands out prominently from the functional buildings of the 1920s.
World heritage site and contemporary living environment
Since 2008, the large Siemensstadt housing estate and five other estates have been UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Other estates include the Hufeisensiedlung and the Weiße Stadt.
The designs of the large Siemensstadt housing estate, which differ considerably on the outside, have one thing in common: they are the result of an intensive thought process. The six architects of the Siemensstadt housing estate were concerned with nothing less than the optimal, contemporary living environment for modern humans. In some respects, they were already anticipating post-war urban planning designs.",,,,https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/styles/visitberlin_bleed_header_visitberlin_mobile_1x/private/image/Grosssiedlung_Siemensstadt_23_BIT_3276Scharun_c_LDA_Foto_Wolfgang_Bittner_DL_PPT_0.jpg?h=ddbc6d2c&itok=VEf00yzX,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/large-siemensstadt-housing-estate,,,,

Berlin",52.4474816,13.6442364,Museum,2,TRUE,Museum im Alten Wasserwerk (Waterworks Museum),A testimonial to Berlins industrial history,,,"The Museum im Wasserwerk on Berlin's Müggelsee celebrates the two most important technical achievements of the metropolis: clean water and clean streets.

Berlin's industrial history of water supply and sewerage is a theme from the underground, and yet critical to life on the surface. Friedrichshagen on Müggelsee is Berlin's third waterwork from 1893. The museum tells the story of Berlin's water supply and urban drainage across a 19th century space stretching for approximately 7,000 square metres. Discover approximately 5,000 items including photos, drawings, plans, maps and documents. Large exhibits of pumps, tubes and cleaning equipment sprawl in the open space. Allow enough time for a guided tour that delves beneath the ground.

Fresh water for Berlin
Architect Richard Schultze and the English engineer Henry Gill build the Friedrichshagener waterworks in 1893. It is one of the largest of its kind in Europe and is an exciting testimony to Berlin's industrial culture. Visitors to the museum will be amazed by its unusual buildings. Six engine houses of red brick and their turrets are more reminiscent of a monastery than urban facilities. The museum itself is located in a disused part of the system, a former powerhouse amongst several sand filters, outbuildings and tenements. Its centrepiece is the original machine shop with an accumulation of huge wheels, tubes, boilers and pressure gauges. Look out for the steam piston engine that starts loudly. Through a tunnel-like underground passageway (only accessed on the guided tour), come into the top room with electric driven pumps. Note the control panels which are made of marble. The museum documents the history of sanitation. For centuries, waste water from the Berlin tip flows onto the road, the fetid puddles a source of disease. From 1873, this is ameliorated by the construction of a sewer system along the lines of cities such as London or Paris. By 1909 all Berlin households are connected to the network. In the wide open space of the museum, pumps, pipes and old channel cleaners recall these early feats of engineering.

Berlin",52.5286601,13.2991962,Architecture,2,FALSE,Gustav Adolf Church,"Anyone who steps inside will feel its incredible spatial effect: Otto Bartning's Gustav
Adolf Church in Charlottenburg-Nord.",,,"The Gustav Adolf Church was Otto Bartning’s masterpiece – an icon of New Objectivity that never lost its appeal. The architect combined functionalism with warmth by using light and space in an ingenious way.

New church buildings are somewhat rare today, unlike a hundred years ago. At that time, new parishes were emerging everywhere: many people moved to the still - independent city of Charlottenburg in search of work. The Gustav Adolf parish was formed in 1915 – a new evangelical community in the north of the city.

There was a long way to go until their own church could be built. Although the new parish quickly gained 21,000 members, there was hardly any money, so they had to hold their church services in a school, private apartments, and restaurants.

It was only with the support of the Berlin Synod Association that they were able to construct their own building. The parish held an architecture competition but weren’t convinced by the quality of the submissions. In 1929, they transferred their building contract to the distinguished master church builder Otto Bartning, whose Steel Church made of steel and glass had caused a furore at an exhibition in Cologne the year before.

Strong impression
The building site in Charlottenburg was located on a corner plot at the intersection of Brahe - and Herschelstrasse. Although the conditions were actually unfavourable, Bartning turned them to his advantage: the street corner became the starting point for the entire building, which was further accentuated by a slender, high bell tower. From here, the church fanned outwards into a total of five naves. He positioned the church hall and the convent at the sides.

Girders made of reinforced concrete formed the basis of the building, which was able to accommodate a total of 1,150 visitors. The architect chose yellow - brown clinker brick for the facing. But above all, the steel construction allowed for the incorporation of large window areas. The side windows were decorated in different hues and filled the church with warm light, irrespective of the weather or time of day. The grey - blue windows behind the altar took on a different role: they didn’t let any light into the room, but opened up the spacious room without dazzling visitors.

Purposeful spatial effect
Bartning created a sloping floor between the entrance and the chancel. When people approached the chancel, they appeared to get smaller as the elevated altar and a huge cross loomed before them. This was intended to give believers a sense of humility.

There was no choir, as the sermon was to take centre stage. This not only applied to the visual impact of the sermon but also the acoustics: Bartning’s construction ontrolled the sound wave dispersion, so there was no reverberation. An expressionist detail could be found in the church organ, with its striking serrated silhouette.

Rescuing the masterpiece

The Gustav Adolf Church was one of the last building projects during the Weimar Republic period. The Nazis used it for their own purposes: in 1934, the pro - Nazi German Christians organised its inauguration in the presence of Ludwig Müller, the Nazi Reich Bishop of the Evangelical Church. The church was severely damaged by several bombs in the Second World War and the parish was unable to find any money for repairs during the post - war period. They even contemplated pulling the church down. But the architect saved his work.

The Nazis had denounced Otto Bartning’s work as “cultural Bolshevism” but he gained recognition again after the war. He became president of the Association of German
Architects in 1950. Prior to this he had already succeeded in setting up an emergency church programme and, with the help of American sponsors, was able to repair churches.

And this included the Gustav Adolf Church. The Neues Bauen (New Building) techniques proved to be useful. The reinforced concrete foundation was preserved in spite of the
bombing and the emergency church programme from 1949 to 1951 ensured a simplified reconstruction. At the end of the decade, the historical monument was restored to its previous condition. The bright windows with their warm colours have since regained their original glory. Only the expressionist church organ was irrevocably destroyed by the war.

Our tips for the Gustav Adolf Church
You can visit Schloss Charlottenburg, which lies in the immediate vicinity. You also have the opportunity to discover other Berlin Modernism attractions by public transport. Take the bus M27 from Jungfernheide S+U-Bahn station towards Pankow S+U-Bahn station. Get off at the Turmstrasse/Beuss elstrasse stop and walk to Huttenstrasse: there you will find the AEG turbine factory, the first building of modern industrial architecture. Not to be missed is another sacred Modernist building: the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. To get there, take the Ringbahn (circular line) to Westhafen and then take the U-Bahn line 9 towards Rathaus Steglitz.

Ever since reunification they have been one of the main meeting points for scenesters and tourists alike. The complex is in the historical Scheunenviertel area of Spandauer Vorstadt in Mitte. They are the largest single courtyard complex in Germany and have been listed buildings since 1972. 
In the 17th century, the area where the Hackesche Höfe are now located wasn’t even part of Berlin. There were lots of barns there for storing hay and straw, which couldn’t be kept in the city because of the fire risk. Although the area around Hackescher Markt has long since been part of the city centre, it’s still called the Scheunenviertel (Barn Quarter) today.  

By 1700, many people had settled outside the city walls in the area that became known as the Spandauer Vorstadt. It even had its own church. In 1731 it became part of Berlin when the Prussian king Friedrich Wilhelm I had the city walls extended. Shortly afterwards, Hackescher Markt was build according to the plans of the city commandant Hans Christoph Graf von Hacke. 

Jewish residents in particular settled in the area around Hackescher Markt in the following years, and a vibrant Jewish community developed. The Jewish cemetery was opened on Große Hamburger Straße, and in 1866 the synagogue was built on Oranienburger Straße, where it still stands today. 

The history of the Hackesche Höfe
The courtyard complex opposite Hackescher Markt was opened on 23 September 1906 after several years of construction. It was designed and built by the architect Kurt Berndt, and the Art Nouveau façade was the work of August Endell. As with many Berlin courtyard buildings, the complex is used for a mixture of offices, shops, workshops (particularly in the front courtyards) and flats. 

The buildings were only partially damaged during the Second World War, but became increasingly dilapidated while Germany was partitioned. They were state property in the GDR and neglected at the time. 

Only after reunification, starting in 1993, was the complex extensively restored at a cost of 80 million deutschmarks, and it soon became a magnet for tourists.

The Hackesche Höfe today: restaurants, bars and shops
The original use of the buildings was included in the restoration concept and successfully implemented. Today, the eight courtyards of the Hackesche Höfe between Rosenthaler Straße and Sophienstraße have 27,000 square metres of space for 40 businesses, including cultural institutions, a cinema, cafés, shops and apartments. 

All around the Hackesche Höfe, bars, restaurants and clubs have opened, and the area is now one of Berlin’s most popular places for nightlife.

The courtyards with apartments are closed at night, but the front courtyards with bars, the cinema and theatres are always open. 

Travel and parking

It’s always busy around the Hackesche Höfe and Hackescher Markt, and there is hardly anywhere to park. We therefore recommend getting there by public transport. The S-Bahn, U-Bahn, trams and buses all stop at Hackescher Markt.

Complementing the programme of events are regular film screenings, performances and talks from international personalities from the worlds of culture, business, art and science. Yet the House on Lützowplatz is not only for established figures from the art scene. On the contrary, it gives a platform to emerging artistic and curatorial talent. Attracting a diverse audience, the centre hosts up to eight different exhibitions annually.
An eventful past: contemporary art and culture in one historic house
In 1873, architect Wilhelm Neumann starts work on his house with its striking neo-baroque façade on Lützowplatz, one of Berlin's most attractive squares. After Jewish families are evicted from their properties in 1938, the building is taken over by an association of Berlin artists. In 1943, it is damaged heavily in bombing raids. During the post-war era, it is rebuilt and in 1950, Lützowplatz cultural centre opens. This new Berlin art institution focuses on classic modernist paintings by the likes of Chagall or Kokoschka. Leading social democrats and trade unionists from West Berlin found an arts promotion association in 1961, with the aim of breathing life into the cultural world of Berlin. This new association buys the building known as House on Lützowplatz and begins to develop it from a cultural club to a wider centre for contemporary art and social discussions. In the House on Lützowplatz you will find modern artworks within 19th-century interiors. The entrance to the building gives a good flavour of what the house is about. Leading into the house via what used to be a window is a metal staircase sculpture by Volkmar Haase. Inside, there are two main exhibition rooms, featuring their original baroque interiors. In total, there is 240 square metres of exhibition space available in the front building. The bright rooms of this former mansion allow visitors to experience works in a relaxed and private atmosphere. The smaller rooms in the side wings usually host smaller exhibitions. Another outstanding feature of the house is its courtyard garden which strikes the perfect balance between tranquil back garden and modern art space.

The art of crossing boundaries
The art collections of Marx, Marzona and Flick now all belong to the Hamburger Bahnhof museum. The Nationalgalerie also shows its collection here. This modern art museum's history starts in the mid 1980s. The Nationalgalerie takes over the private art collection of building contractor Erich Marx, including world famous works by Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Anselm Kiefer. The local Berlin government decides on the old station building near the Berlin Wall as a home for this collection, but it remains heavily damaged after the Second World War and requires extensive renovation. Architect Joseph Paul Kleihues is contracted to carry out the reconstruction, and the museum opens its doors in 1996. The Nationalgalerie is home to works by Gerhard Richter, John Cage and Imi Knoebel. The aim of the museum is to encompass all artistic disciplines and to blur boundaries. Visitors will notice, for example, installation art by Michel Majerus, who uses imagery from computer games in his artwork.
The photography section is also outstanding, with works by influential photographers such as Bernd and Hilla Becher, Thomas Ruff and Andreas Gursky. In 2002, Egidio Marzona's collection is also acquired by the museum, featuring conceptual art and Italian Arte Povera. Finally, collector Christian Flick makes a permanent loan of his collection to the museum, consisting of more than 1,500 works of art. Between and 2012, several pieces of this collection are donated to the museum. Exhibits can be found in Rieckhallen, a neighbouring building and the former warehouse of a freight company. The building alone is impressive: around 6,000 square metres in size, it has a simple black facade made of trapezoidal sheet metal. Flick's collection consists of conceptual art by artists such as Marcel Duchamp and Bruce Nauman, and media art by Nam June Paik.

The idyllic surroundings were the inspiration for the artist’s paintings and drawings and also served a very practical purpose: she sold flowers from the garden at the cemetery and fruit at the market.

Berlin, Mitte",52.5179673,13.3421577,Nieghborhood,1,FALSE,Hansaviertel,"In the 1950s, the divided city battled out the Cold War in the field of housing construction too.",,,"After the Second World War, Berlin was largely destroyed. The western part formed a tiny island in the communist Eastern bloc and there was a lack of living space throughout. It was precisely at this time that the SED regime in the Soviet-occupied eastern part of the city pulled off a PR coup: it promised the city of the future – with modern and affordable housing for all.
Along Stalinallee in Friedrichshain residential blocks for workers were springing up in no time at all. And these were not just any blocks: these buildings looked exactly how many people imagined princely palaces to be. The exteriors boasted classicist façades, while inside the furnishings were of high quality at a reasonable rental price. It was quite clear: these luxurious residential buildings were also intended to convince West Berliners of the victory of socialism.
West Berlin had to find an answer to this, but one that expressed democracy.

In 1953, the city organised a design competition. The concept presented by architects Willy Kreuer and Gerhard Jobst prevailed: buildings in line with the ideas of New Objectivity, widely-spaced in the urban environment and with lots of green in between. A place was quickly found: the old Hansaviertel (Hanseatic Quarter) had been completely destroyed and provided a space for the architects to implement their ideas.
An exhibition of superlatives
Otto Bartning was a renowned master builder and president of the Association of German Architects. He invited 53 colleagues from 13 countries to construct modern buildings in the Hansaviertel. The response was tremendous – architects from all over the world came to build in West Berlin, including such greats as Walter Gropius, Oscar Niemeyer and Alvar Aalto. When Interbau 57 opened in 1957, the public didn’t see an ordinary exhibition: visitors didn’t marvel at models or drawings, but finished residential buildings, even real high-rise buildings for social housing.
Unlike in East Berlin, the architects didn’t build with bricks, but with reinforced concrete. For the façades, they were guided by the function of the buildings, doing without historicist cladding. And the possibility of fitting more apartments into high-rise buildings than in traditional buildings meant that there was plenty of space for green areas.
The interiors were also carefully thought out. Alvar Aalto developed the concept of “Allraum” for his building (Klopstockstraße 30–32): the apartments did not have a hallway, but rather a large living room branching off directly to the bedrooms and children’s rooms. Aalto, like Oscar Niemeyer, wanted to promote mingling between residents by planning common rooms. In practice, however, the tenants hardly used them at all.
The most famous high-rise building in the Hansaviertel is the 17-storey “Giraffe” (Klopstockstraße 2). Like the large cloven hoofed animals in the nearby zoo, it towered above everything else. The design showed that modern building was not immune to a reactionary understanding of roles. The Giraffe consisted of one-bedroom apartments. The architects Klaus Müller-Rehm and Gerhard Siegmann designed separate wings for women and men. While the women’s units were fitted with a fully-equipped kitchen, the men’s apartments only had kitchen cupboards. These traditional allocations were already outdated in 1957, and women and men moved into the apartments regardless of the separation.
In the Hansaviertel, however, not only high-rise but also detached houses and atrium bungalows were being built for private building owners. The building at Händelallee 59 is particularly unique: a special 
wake-up window was inserted so that residents would be gently awakened by the light of the morning sun.
However, there were not enough private building owners. Ultimately, only 36 of the planned 45 properties were built in the Hansaviertel. One of the free spaces at Hanseatenweg 10 was given to the 
Akademie der Künste (Academy of Arts). The Kongresshalle and Le Corbusier’s Unité d’habitation were realised by the architects outside the Hansaviertel.
Small town versus grand boulevard
The Hansaviertel was not only an alternative concept to the Stalinallee in terms of the construction method: it functioned like a small town. Above and beyond the apartments there were also small shops, a cinema, a shopping centre and its own underground station. The Hansabücherei in the open glass building was one of the first German libraries with an open access area.
Two new churches were also built, both of which did without historicist stylistic elements: the Protestant Kaiser-Friedrich Memorial Church and the Catholic parish church of St. Ansgar.
No victor in the exhibition fight
When Interbau 57 opened, it became a magnet for visitors. Everyone wanted to see the show apartments with Scandinavian furniture, Italian fabrics and Bauhaus tubular steel armchairs. More than anything, no-one wanted to miss out on the cable car ride over the Hansaviertel.
In the end, neither the monumental workers’ palaces on Stalinallee nor the modern designs of the Hansaviertel would prevail. Both were simply too expensive for price-oriented mass housing construction. Money ended up bringing about an unintended rapprochement during the Cold War: new housing estates in West and East Germany would soon look very similar.
Grand Tour of Modernism
To mark the 100th anniversary of the Bauhaus in 2019, the Bauhaus Association developed a Grand Tour of Modernism that takes architecture fans all over Germany. The Hansaviertel is part of this theme route.
Our tips for the Hansaviertel
If you wander through the Hansaviertel you should visit the Akademie der Künste (Academy of Arts) – and not only for the opening festival of Bauhaus100. The Grips-Theater, which celebrates its 50th anniversary in 2019, is located directly at Hansaplatz underground station. Since 1986, it has put on many successful plays, including the musical “Linie 1”. The Teehaus im Englischen Garten (teahouse) is located within walking distance of the Victory Column in the Tiergarten. The Konditorei Buchwald 
(confectionery), where delicious Baumkuchen has been baked for 160 years, can be found at Bellevue underground station. From nearby Moabiter Bridge, you have a good view of the listed industrial buildings of the former Meierei C. Bolle (dairy), and of the St. Johanniskirche, designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel.",,,Grand Tour of Berlin Modernism,https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/styles/visitberlin_bleed_header_visitberlin_mobile_1x/private/image/Hansaviertel_Interbau_05_BIT_1376_c_LDA_Foto_Wolfgang_Bittner_DL_PPT_1.jpg?h=ac7c4040&itok=V0Y18XQn,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/hansaviertel,,,,
"Am Rupenhorn 25
14055 
Berlin",52.50831,13.2175033,Architecture,2,FALSE,Haus am Rupenhorn,"Outside the city centre on the border with Spandau, two villas can be found that embody the ideals of Neues Bauen (New Building).",,,"Built between 1929 and 1930, the white, geometrically austere forms of the country houses at Am Rupenhorn 24 and 25 symbolise the emergence of a new era of architecture.
They still stand out in clear contrast to the green surroundings today and appear timelessly modern thanks to their clear edges and large windows.
The houses stand on a double plot. There were originally meant to be three buildings but only two were constructed. The architects Hans Luckhardt, Wassili Luckhardt and Alfons Anker were commissioned by the merchant Richard Kluge to build them in 1929.
Reduced to form and function
At this point, Hans and Wassili Luckhardt had already made a name for themselves on the Berlin architecture scene. In 1919, Bruno Taut, one of the influential master builders of Berlin Modernism, invited the two to take part in the Gläserne Kette (Glass Chain) artists' group he had initiated. The pioneering architects exchanged information about their work in a circular.
During the 1920s, the Luckhardt brothers moved away from their expressionist origins and began to take an interest in the design language of New Objectivity.
The architect Alfons Anker joined them in 1923 and together with Hans and Wassili Luckhardt, tried out unusual forms of building at the experimental Schorlemerallee estate in Zehlendorf between 1925 and 1927. The white cubes correspond to the New Objectivity style: clear lines, reduced to basic forms and function.
The Luckhardt and Anker architect’s office was given even greater freedom in designing the villas at Am Rupenhorn.
Modernism as an experimental laboratory
It was easier for the classical modernist architects to put their innovative ideas into practice when building private houses. Their clients were often more open to their revolutionary designs than the public financiers.
The Luckhardt brothers and Alfons Anker based their work on the 1927 publication Fünf Punkte zu einer neuen Architektur (Five Points for a New Architecture) by Le Corbusier in which the French architect called for a free internal layout, rooftop gardens, and the use of wide windows.
The houses on Am Rupenhorn were built using a skeleton construction. This meant the exterior walls bore the main weight of the building, allowing for a varied internal layout. On the ground floor of the house at Am Rupenhorn 25, the living area consisted of a single large room which conveyed a feeling of generous space. Raising the ground floor provided better ventilation.
The large ribbon windows in both houses created a connection between indoors and outdoors and ensured uniform light in the living areas. The curved terrace extended the living space outdoors. The Luckhardts and Alfons Anker took full account of the wonderful landscape surrounding Am Rupenhorn.
Rooftop gardens on the flat roofs improved the quality and living space of the house. From up there, there is a magnificent view across the nearby Stößensee lake and on towards Spandau.
Between past and present
Their client, Richard Kluge, only lived in the country house on Am Rupenhorn for half a year before he went bankrupt. The houses were returned to the bank, which arranged for them to be converted into apartments.
After 1933, Hans and Wassili Luckhardt attempted to come to terms with the new powers that be and joined the NSDAP (Nazi Party) in May. Alfons Anker was banned from his profession and fled to Sweden.
The state acquired the properties in 1939 with the aim of demolishing them to create space for a planned National Socialist university town. The outbreak of the Second World War prevented these plans from being carried out.
Further decades of structural changes followed. We can only hazard a guess at the original condition of the villas. This particularly applies to the house at Am Rupenhorn 24, of which only the external form corresponds to the designs of the Luckhardt and Anker office.
The house at Am Rupenhorn 25 has been a listed building since 1975. The husband-and-wife architect team Christa Kliemke and Robert Wischer bought the country house in 1997. With the support of the Deutsche Stiftung Denkmalschutz (German Foundation for Monument Conservation), they restored the original condition of the house in several stages by 2011. Details inside the house, such as the red linoleum floors and nickel-plated banisters, were carefully reconstructed by the new owners. Furniture from the time at which the house was built completed the picture.
Our tips for the Haus am Rupenhorn 25
You can visit the country house at Am Rupenhorn on Fridays from 2 pm. You can make a booking by calling 030/3059100 (answering machine) and admission costs 10 euros. At the Rupenhorn estate it is worth looking over the garden fence at other attractions such as Touro College Berlin, which was designed by the Bauhaus architect Bruno Paul.

Berlin",52.43233,13.16635,Museum,2,TRUE,House of the Wannsee Conference,How the Holocaust was planned,,,"The mansion at Großen Wannsee 56-58 was the location for a conference with earth-shattering consequences. In 1942, leading figures in the Nazi government and SS meet here to discuss their so-called Final Solution to the Jewish Question. The exhibition in the House of the Wannsee Conference gives an insight into this criminal meeting, and how the plan was put into practice. It details the genocide perpetrated on the European Jews through the use of original documents and audiovisual presentations.

Revisit Germany's darkest times in glamorous rooms
In 1914, pharmaceutical manufacturer Ernst Marlier builds his new luxury villa, and a few years later anti-Republican and right wing industrialist Friedrich Minoux takes ownership of it. He sells the villa to an SS foundation in 1941 for use as a guest house. The following year, National Socialists are already planning the Wannsee Conference. After the Second World War, the villa is handed over to the political party SPD who establish an educational centre called the August-Bebel-Institute. It serves as a school between 1952 and 1982. In 1982, Richard von Weizsäcker, Berlin's mayor, designates the house a memorial, and since 1992, on the 50th anniversary of the Wannsee Conference, it becomes an official museum and educational centre.
The first impression of the mansion is deceptive; the House of the Wannsee Conference is like any other provincial country estate – a magnificent mansion built in the Italian country house style. Inside, the rooms are well-lit and elegant, giving no hint of the events which happened here. The first exhibition room gives information about the people who attended the conference, along with documents about anti-semitism and racism in the 1920s. Go through the hall to see items of Third Reich propaganda such as posters and leaflets. Further three rooms are devoted to the collaboration with the Nazi leaders, along with archive material from Eastern Europe which has only been on public display since the 1990s.

Important things to see in the exhibition
Original documents from the Wannsee Conference and information about the participants.
Audiovisual presentations about the history of Jewish persecution.
Photos and books about Jewish ghettos, their function and everyday life there.
Detailed information about deportation and extermination of Jews.
Multimedia centre for the study of National Socialism.
Sights at Wannsee
Just 400m from the mansion is the Liebermann Villa where artist Max Liebermann started painting at the beginning of the 20th century. See many of his 200 paintings in his original studio upstairs in the villa. The exhibition also focuses on the fate of Liebermann and his family, including his wife Martha who committed suicide in 1943 to escape Nazi persecution.
A walk through the Düppel Forest brings you to a jetty on Lake Wannsee from where you can catch a ferry to Pfaueninsel (Peacock Island) on the river Havel. In the 1820s, landscape architect Peter Joseph Lenné creates an English-style country park for the Prussian royal family. Named after the peacocks which roam free on the island, the park is a fine example of this style of German architecture. Friedrich Wilhelm II's castle, built in the late 18th century, is also on the site – open for visits from April to October.

And its architecture is still modern.",,,"A concert in the Haus des Rundfunks is always a trip back in the history of Berlin radio. And, as you look around, you'll find that it's also one of the finest examples of modern architecture in Berlin.
Modern architecture for a broadcasting house
The Haus des Rundfunks was one of the first purpose-built broadcasting buildings in Europe. Designed by architect Hans Poelzig, it was inaugurated in 1931 after two years of construction. It is one of the best examples of modern architecture in Berlin. The closed-off structure of the building complex is ideal for isolating the sound in the broadcasting studios, all of which face the inner courtyard to protect them against street noise. The imposing façade is covered with black clinker bricks and reddish-brown ceramic tiles.
Concerts in the broadcasting studios
The studios are also used for concerts and radio recordings. The Deutsche Symphonie-Orchester regularly performs in the large broadcasting stuio, which can accommodate audiences of up to 900. The Rundfunk-Sinfonie-Orchester also performs there, including its wildly popular series classical music series for children and teenagers. The studios retain their post-war look from the 1950s, while its sophisticated technology and particularly good acoustics have also survived the tests of time. It has its own foundation to prevent any vibrations from the rest of the building from being transferred. Concerts are also held in the small broadcast studio with seats for 150.
""Achtung, Achtung, hier ist Berlin!""
The Haus des Rundfunks is also a place with a rich history. It was from here that the first regular television broadcasts began in the 1930s. After the war, it was the seat of the SFB, the West Berlin radio station. The ringing of the Freedom Bell in the Schöneberg Town Hall was used to identify the station acoustically. Today, the Haus des Rundfunks houses the Berlin studios of Radio Berlin-Brandenburg (RBB), the result of the 2003 merger of SFB and Ostdeutsche Rundfunk Brandenburg (ORB).",,,"Industrial Architecture

With the House of the German Steelworkers Union, architect Erich Mendelsohn designed an outstanding example of Neues Bauen from 1929 to 1930. It not only served as the trade union’s headquarters, but was also intended to symbolise their socio-political commitment. It has a curved façade at the front of the elongated building complex and the flag pole with the trade union flag above the main façade is in the form of a demonstrator at the head of a protest march.
Mendelsohn was a successful architect in the 1920s. He had 40 employees working for him and clients such as trade unions and companies lining up. You can see just how modern the House of the German Steelworkers Union is if you walk a few steps further to the corner of Gitschiner Strasse/Lindenstrasse. There you will find the former Kaiserliche Patentamt (Imperial Patent Office), a building in the style of the German Empire decorated with an historicist façade.
Carefully emphasizing the horizontal
The House of the German Steelworkers Union is a work of New Objectivity. It didn’t have any ornamentation or historical allusions, but was made using a new building technique. A steel skeleton supported the building complex but it was not just functional. Thanks to the steel girders, Mendelsohn was able to freely design the façades and indulge his preference for expressive buildings: with the concave, inward-curving main façade, for example.
Mendelsohn filled it with huge strips of windows, some of which wrapped around the corners. The windows drew horizontal lines across the building, which was by no means a coincidence. Mendelsohn used the horizontal as a remedy against the stress of modern living:
“The man of our times can only find respite from the excitement of his brisk life in the relaxed horizontal.”
To underscore the impact of the trade union headquarters, Mendelsohn used high-quality materials:
 the exterior cladding was made of travertine limestone, just like the Shell-Haus (Shell House) on Reichpietschufer, which was built at the same time. The architect used bronze for the door and window surrounds. At the front end of the building he installed an elegantly curved spiral staircase. Its importance was underlined by the above-average height of the first floor, which also housed the conference hall and could be seen from outside through a large glass front.

Sudden demise and a new beginning
The Steelworkers Union inaugurated its new headquarters in 1930. It was delayed because the construction workers went on strike against the union for weeks. During the Weimar Republic, the communist-minded workers and pro-SPD trade unions were adversaries.
The real danger, however, came from the right: after the Nazis came into power in 1933, they banned the trade unions. Three years after its opening, the House of the German Steelworkers Union became the headquarters of the Nazi German Labour Front.
And the architect? Mendelsohn had to go into exile in 1933. He worked in England, then travelled to Palestine in 1934. In 1941, he emigrated to the United States. Ernst Sagebiel, Mendelsohn’s construction manager at the House of the German Steelworkers Union, headed in the opposite direction: he joined the NSDAP (National Socialist German Workers Party) and built barracks and 
Tempelhof Airport for the new regime.
The House of the German Steelworkers Union was bombed during the Second World War and almost completely burnt down in 1945. IG Metall restored the building from 1948 to 1952. Extensive historically-accurate restoration work was performed in 1989.
Today, the building almost looks like it did in 1930. It is still a trade union building and the headquarters of the IG Metall District Management for Berlin, Brandenburg and Saxony.

An English-style country house is not where you would expect to find one of Berlin's leading contemporary art galleries. The Haus am Waldsee in Zehlendorf is where Berlin's young, contemporary artists exhibit their work. Discover arts such as sculpture and painting, alongside design, architecture and even performance art - all forms are represented here. Experience the quiet and tranquil atmosphere in the house, which hosts up to five exhibitions annually. This also includes themed exhibitions, featuring the work of multiple artists.

Tranquil and inspiring: encounters with international art

The museum opens in 1946, immediately after the war. Located in the countryside, away from the busy city centre, it develops as an exciting centre for international contemporary arts. Today, the house welcomes creative talent which has pushed Berlin up the ranks of international art. Supported by the district council, the art centre is run by a sponsor association. One of the unusual aspects of the centre's approach is putting reflection, sensuality and inspiration at the heart of everything. This includes personal contact between artists and visitors. Start your visit by taking the direct path to the entrance of the Haus am Waldsee. The house, built in 1923 for textile manufacturer Hermann Knobloch, still has a cosy, rural feel. Tony Cragg's bright yellow sculpture entitled ""Outspan"" sits outside and gives an indication of what you can expect to find within. Pass through the attractive doorway, flanked by columns, and enter a house full of surprises. Inside, the intimate atmosphere aids your enjoyment of the art. The rooms are flooded with light, and are similar to living rooms. Maybe this helps the contemporary art come into its own. Take a walk through the villa's garden, where you'll find more sculptures and contemporary works of art. Or take a rest at the in-house café and let the impressions of what you have seen sink in.

It’s the place for discovering new and unfamiliar forms of expression, and for discussions and experimentation.",,,"The ‘pregnant oyster’ is what Berliners supposedly call the Haus der Kulturen der Welt, because of its round, gently curving roof. And there are also hidden pearls to discover inside it. But as appropriate as the nickname might be, no-one actually uses it, because its real name so accurately describes what goes on there.
A house for the arts
An open and cosmopolitan forum for contemporary arts and dialogue, the Haus der Kulturen is home to every form of art from all over the world. It might be theatre or dance, film or literature, readings or exhibitions – or performances mixing different art forms and blurring the boundaries between them. Social and artistic topics are questioned and discussed, and the house is a place for dialogue and for lively, and occasionally heated, discussion. Every February, the Haus der Kulturen der Welt is overrun by a much younger audience, when the Berlinale screens its children’s films in the great auditorium.
The popular summertime open-air spectacle Wassermusik is a musical journey of discovery, each time to a different part of the world. On the terrace looking out to the Spree there are concerts with music that you won’t have heard before, along with films and documentaries.
The Kongresshalle
As a contribution to the IBA international architecture exhibition in 1957, the American architect Hugh Stubbins built the Kongresshalle directly beside the Spree as a symbol of the friendship between the United States and Germany and a forum for free expression of opinions. Its most striking feature was its roof, which seemed to float in thin air and led to the nickname of ‘pregnant oyster’. However, due to structural damage, part of the roof collapsed in 1980, and the building was not restored until 1987, in time for Berlin’s 750 year anniversary. Two years later the Kongresshalle was renamed the Haus der Kulturen der Welt and began its new existence.
The Carillon
For Berlin’s 750 year anniversary, not only was the Kongresshalle restored, but a bell tower was constructed beside it. It is the largest carillon in the world, with 68 bells. Every Sunday at 3 p.m., and on many public holidays there is a concert – played live in the bell tower.

The Neukladow manor house, situated on the banks of the Havel, was used by a workers’ charity after the Second World War, and then stood empty for many years.

A bit further east, the setting becomes somewhat romantic: surrounded by an avenue of white blossom chestnut trees, a pergola covered in vine leaves frames the panorama terrace of Zeltinger Platz.
In the northern part of Frohnau, a courtyard for artists was set up in 1998 at a picturesque location in the woods. If you continue on from here towards the former border, to where the Wall once stood, you will be surprised to discover paved roads, kerbs and pavements.

Berlin doesn't just have two-legged residents, but also a lot of animals. They have two homes in the urban jungle: one is the Berlin Zoo in the former western part of the city, the other is the Tierpark Berlin in former East Berlin.
Important note: at the moment you can only buy your ticket online via the zoo website.
The Tierpark in the Berlin district Lichtenberg is the largest zoo in Europe. It is best to plan a whole day for your visit. Over 8,000 animals live on an area of 160 hectares and there are about 650 different animal species in total - from the Malaysian bear to polar bears
United Buddy Bears im Tierpark Berlin
With the bear parade along the Alle to Schloss Friedrichsfelde, the exhibition ""The Art of Tolerance"" is back in its home town. Since the first colourful bears went on a world tour, over 2.4 million euros have been collected for UNICEF and local children's aid organisations through various fundraising campaigns. Now, the 146 Buddy Bears at Tierpark Berlin are showing how wonderful it can be when different countries and cultures work hand in hand to set an example for a better future.
You mustn't miss these animals of Berlin:

By the way: You can also visit your favourite animal and look a giraffe right in the eyes or touch an elephant. The Tierpark offers individual guided tours for groups in the enclosures of selected species. You can find all the necessary information on the Tierpark's website.
History of the Tierpark
The Tierpark was built when Berlin became a divided city after the Second World War because East Berlin also wanted to have a zoo. It was opened in 1955 in Schlosspark Friedrichsfelde. The park area, originally designed by garden artist Peter Joseph Lenné, also houses the Friedrichsfelde palace, built in 1695. The Community of Supporters of the Tierpark and Zoo Berlin e. V. took over organising the events that are held here - especially the concerts.","Opening hours

This unusually high number shows that Berlin and its surroundings were once dominated by mills. In the mid-18th century for example, Potsdam is home to 21. One of them is the Historical Mill in Park Sanssouci. Already out of operation in 1858, it burns down in 1945 during the last days of the war. Following its reconstruction, it reopens in 1993 in the same location. Since then, visitors have been able to learn interesting facts about the history and technology of grain processing in this traditional building. Experience the process of grinding and sifting and filling before your eyes.

A visit to a production museum
From a distance you see the wings of the Historical Mill in Park Sanssouci turning slowly in the wind. As you approach, you will hear the rattling of the grinder. Before the entrance, you see the wild vines that climb the walls and frame the windows. The first thematic area is situated on the ground floor. The permanent exhibition deals with mills in Potsdam's cultural landscape. Take the spiral staircase to the first level where exhibits reveal the techniques employed by the traditional windmill. On the next floor, you learn about the history. A mill site since 1738, the original is replaced in 1791 by a Dutch mill. From 1861, it serves only as a museum until its destruction in 1945. The historical mill seen today is rebuilt between 1983 and 1993 after the old model. Enriched with knowledge, you enter the gallery where the wings of the mill turn slowly. Inside once again, proceed to the sifter, or meal floor. Then climb a wooden staircase to the grinding or stone floor and, at the top, the attic. Once a normal place of work, the mill at all levels has a pleasant, nostalgic flair: the creaking of the floorboards and the smell of wood conjure an authentic atmosphere. The gears and grinders have a home-made touch. Flour dust litters this ancient technology, as it does in the gallery. You can also enjoy the panoramic views of Sanssouci Park from high above.

Special features of the historic mill
Permanent exhibition about mill craft (on the 1st floor)

Heavenly castles of Sanssouci
Once in the area, a trip to Sanssouci Palace is worthwhile. Just a short walk through the park, you can't miss it. The Rococo-style castle is built by King Frederick between 1745 and 1747 on the vineyard terraces. The motto of the pleasure palace ""Sans Souci"" means ""without worry"". A walk of approximately 36 minutes brings you to the Lustschloss Belvedere. The magnificent double tower system in the style of an Italian Renaissance Villa has crowned the Pfingstberg Hill since 1863. From here, you're afforded a breathtaking view over Potsdam.

Berlin",52.515098,13.443815,Architecture,2,FALSE,apartment tower at the 'Weberwiese',Prototype of the new construction method,,,"The apartment tower at Weberwiese is more than just a residential building: it is the dream of triumphant GDR socialism made manifest.
When the construction workers and tradesmen took up their tools at Marchlewskistraße 25 on the 1st of September 1951, the majority of Berlin still lay in ruins. The city and all of Germany were partitioned and the Cold War between East and West had begun.
Marchlewskistraße 25 at Weberwiese was a prominent construction site. In the East Berlin district of Friedrichshain, the newly-founded GDR was beginning its “national rebuilding programme”. It didn’t just want to build apartments: it wanted to prove that it had more to offer its population than the capitalist West.
Spacious three-room apartments were being built, complete with built-in kitchen, electric oven and central heating. Telephones and intercom systems were also provided, and even a communal antenna for television reception was supplied. The equipment was ahead of its time, as there were not yet any TV programmes, not to mention any affordable TV sets. Every tenant had access to a rooftop terrace with a glassed-in area.
The tower block was designed to make an impression from the outside as well. Tiles made from Meissen porcelain – although not from the MEISSENER porcelain factory, as was claimed for many years – cover the building, which the workers constructed in the traditional way from bricks. The corners of the building project upwards like towers. Friezes, cornices and pillars decorate the structure.
A turning point in architecture
The lead architect actually had something else in mind. Hermann Henselmann, director of the Weimar University of Architecture and Fine Arts since 1946, had designed Modernist apartment buildings before the Nazis came to power. His first sketches for the Hochhaus an der Weberwiese in 1951 were still clean-cut and functional, but the style was no longer in fashion.
Soviet functionaries criticised the work of East German architects: the new buildings appeared decadent and upper class to them. Instead, they ought to orientate themselves toward national traditions. Modern developments in architecture had already been suppressed in the Soviet Union before the Second World War. Buildings became pompous and prestigious, and Socialist Classicism prevailed.
Criticism and self-criticism
The GDR looked towards its role model, the Soviet Union. Head of state Walter Ulbricht declared that he didn’t want to see “any more American boxes or Hitleresque barracks” in Berlin. In an article, Rudolf Herrnstadt, chief editor of Neues Deutschland, denounced Henselmann’s designs for the Hochhaus an der Weberwiese as flawed.
The architect quickly found a solution: he engaged in public self-criticism after his associates and the playwright Bertolt Brecht advised him to do so. Brecht, Henselmann later explains, told him that “building for millions of people must start from the aesthetic [...] ideas of those millions of common people, and not from me trying to teach them culture”.
Henselmann took governmental guidelines and the architectural style of Karl Friedrich Schinkel as his inspiration. His new plans met with approval. And it also paid off for him personally: as the chief architect of East Berlin’s municipal administration, Henselmann designed Stalinallee, the name given to today’s Karl-Marx-Allee from 1949 until 1961. His Hochhaus an der Weberwiese became the benchmark for the new grand boulevard.
No prototype for mass housing estates
The tower block was to be finished as quickly as possible. Construction work continued through the winter, with builders working around the clock every day, under floodlights at night. The first tenants moved in on the first of May – Labour Day – 1952.
The flagship project was complete – and the SED left nothing to chance. In addition to radio reports on the new building, the GDR celebrated the Hochhaus an der Weberwiese with a commemorative stamp and its very own song.
“In Berlin, in Berlin on the Spree
a stone giant grows on Stalinallee, a stone giant grows on Stalinallee
It is no castle in the air, it can’t be
And yet it grows high into the sky.”
At the topping out ceremony, the media-savvy later head of state Erich Honecker laid the last stone. The Hochhaus an der Weberwiese made it clear: everyone was to enjoy their share of prosperity. Of the 33 new apartments, 30 were allocated to workers’ families; the family of a police officer, a teacher and an architect moved into the remaining ones. From now on they all lived in comparative luxury, paying the very low rent of 90 pfennig per square meter.
On closer inspection, the project exhibited a decisive flaw: the construction of each apartment in the tower block cost nine times more than an average apartment. Much too expensive to serve as a model for the construction of housing estates. Later, a few years after Stalin’s death, GDR architecture also looked towards international Modernism and industrial production.
Ventilation for the right indoor temperature
Many residents ended up spending their whole lives living in the Hochhaus an der Weberwiese. But not everything worked perfectly. In the early years, the lift was often stuck and the central heating could only be regulated by opening the windows. “We also heated the Weberwiese park”, one tenant recalls.
After reunification, the building was restored in the 1990s, except for the rooftop terrace. Its historic preservation order does not permit a conversion in accordance with the new safety regulations. To this day, residents are no longer allowed to use it.",,,Grand Tour of Berlin Modernism,https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/styles/visitberlin_bleed_header_visitberlin_mobile_1x/private/image/Hochhaus_an_der_Weberwiese_19_BIT_6646_c_LDA_Foto_Wolfgang_Bittner_DL_PPT_0.jpg?h=3fd48da7&itok=26oMe7yH,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/apartment-tower-at-weberwiese,,,,

Berlin",52.4487942,13.449618,Architecture,2,FALSE,Large Britz housing estate,Berlin was a cosmopolitan city in the 1920s. But also a place where hundreds of thousands of people lived in catastrophic conditions.,,,"Berlin was a cosmopolitan city in the 1920s. But also a place where hundreds of thousands of people lived in catastrophic conditions.
Dirty, dark, overcrowded – in Berlin's tenements around the 1920s, five or more people frequently shared a room. When some went to work, the others would use their sleeping space. Almost none of the apartments had a bathroom, instead there was a communal toilet in the yard or stairwell.
Exponents of Neues Bauen (New Building) had long been calling for improvements to the living conditions of poor people. But it was not until during the Weimar Republic that urban planners and architects were given the opportunity to do something: Berlin became a field of experimentation for innovative urban planning ideas. The housing estates that are today UNESCO World Heritage Sites were erected on the outskirts of the metropolis within a few years: the Hufeisensiedlung housing estate, the Schillerpark housing estate, the Wohnstadt Carl Legien, 
the Weiße Stadt and the Siemensstadt housing estate. The Hufeisensiedlung is the largest of these housing estates and was the reform movement’s reference project.
The two sides of an avenue
In the early 1920s, the south of Neukölln still consisted of undeveloped open spaces. The city of Berlin bought these in 1924 and commissioned two housing cooperatives to build the Britz large housing estate: the municipal housing company DeGeWo (Deutsche Gesellschaft zur Förderung des Wohnungsbaus) and the trade union-linked GEHAG (Gemeinnützige Heimstätten-, Spar- und Bau-Aktiengesellschaft).
On the face of it, both companies proceeded in a similar way. They built residential multi-storey buildings and terraced houses, which were designed around a central pond area, on the left and the right of Fritz Reuter Allee. However, the avenue actually ended up separating the different lifestyles and contrasting models of society from each other.
To the east of Fritz Reuter Allee in the Krugpfuhlsiedlung (Krugpfuhl housing estate), DeGeWo built traditional residential buildings with historicising façades as in the German Empire: saddle roofs, bay windows, and pointed dormers. To the west, GEHAG delivered a radical alternative with the Hufeisensiedlung: when you walk along the avenue, you will notice the contrast. Opposite the Krugpfuhlsiedlung is the so-called Red Front with 32 almost identical housing units in a deep red colour interrupted by stairwells protruding out of the front of the buildings like fortified towers. At the time, the term “Red Front” did not just refer to the colour, it was also a byword for the political stance of its planners and residents.
Light, air and sun
The housing estate owes its name to the central horseshoe-shaped residential ensemble. Martin Wagner, who was head of GEHAG at the time and an authoritative planner and later Berlin’s city building councillor, engaged the Neues Bauen exponent Bruno Taut as an architect. Taut had already made a name for himself before the First World War with the Gartenstadt Falkenberg (Falkenberg garden city).
With the Hufeisensiedlung, he set standards in modern house building. The almost 2,000 dwellings in the multi-storey buildings and terraced houses had standardised floor plans, living rooms, bedrooms, a bathroom, and a kitchen. What we take for granted today was at that time a luxury for many.
Instead of gables, Taut used flat roofs to enlarge the living space on the upper floors. Modern windows improved the incidence of light and ensured better ventilation. Each apartment had a private garden or at least a view of the green and open spaces that landscape architect Leberecht Migge designed for the Hufeisensiedlung.
The Hüsung courtyard was a striking place: here Taut created a rural idyll with village square and lime tree. The architect also integrated a community area with café and central laundry facilities in the end buildings on Fritz Reuter Allee.
Taut used contrasting colours for the façades and interior design, which became his trademark. He found them to be a cheap and effective design element. However, most of the residents didn’t like the colourful walls and covered them with wallpaper. You can get an idea of what the interior design was like at TAUTES HEIM (TAUT’S HOME) [internal link] or at the Hufeisensiedlung information station.
Between ambition and reality
GEHAG built the Hufeisensiedlung in six construction phases between 1925 and 1930. A final, seventh phase was undertaken in 1932/33 without Taut's participation and under great cost pressure. This was not listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
The construction of the Hufeisensiedlung followed traditional production methods. Although standardised components and modern machines were used, the houses did not have steel structures but were based on masonry.
The Hufeisensiedlung was not able to fulfil its social function as planned. The building ended up costing as much as comparable private projects. As a result, the rent remained high and unaffordable for workers and craftsmen, self-employed people, civil servants, and politically engaged artists and intellectuals moved in instead.
After they seized power, the Nazis pursued many of the Hufeisensiedlung inhabitants. One of them was the anarchist and writer Erich Mühsam, who was murdered in the Oranienburg concentration camp in 1934. Bruno Taut and Martin Wagner also left Germany and went into exile.
After extensive renovation work, Taut's famous colours shine once again today in all their old glory.

The new Humboldt Forum in Berlin Mitte extends over an area of around 30,000 square metres and is visible from afar. The reconstructed baroque palace façades on the northern, southern and western sides of the Forum shine in bright quince yellow. The eastern side of the Forum on the banks of the Spree is surprising: a modern, smooth exterior façade, with the “Spree balcony” viewing platform in front and a large terrace just above the surface of the water on the riverbank.

The architecture of the Humboldt Forum clearly thrives on a contrasting combination of ultra-modern building elements and the reconstructed sculptural façades of Berlin’s former Baroque palace.

First of all, two large new city squares, which will be open to urban life around the clock: the large 
Schlüterhof and the Passage, a wide colonnaded path that runs right through the building. An impressive foyer on the ground floor connects high-rise modern gallery walls with the reconstructed palace portal. This is where the “cosmographer”, a 17-metre-high media tower and quick-change artist, stands: it will not only radiate information, but can transform at any time into a gigantic art and light installation. Visitors will pass through the foyer to reach two special exhibition areas, which will present an interactive children’s exhibition as part of the opening.
Immerse yourself in the history of the site
In the sculpture hall on the ground floor, the original sandstone figures of the castle façades can be viewed close up. And on the southern side of the Humboldt Forum, a 28-metre-long video panorama
 will be on display, vividly illustrating the historical development of the site – since the earliest dated evidence from the 12th century. Visitors can really immerse themselves in the history of the location in the palace cellar, where the remains of the medieval Dominican monastery and the foundations of the palace have been uncovered.
The Berlin exhibition: Berlin from new perspectives
On the first floor of the completely wheelchair-accessible building, the Berlin exhibition offers a surprising special view of Berlin: And it’s not only global developments that have influenced and shaped Berlin that come into focus here. It also asks what impact Berlin has had on the world and what inspirations emanated from this city – and it does this interactively with the help of its visitors. Imaginative media and the World Studio, where personal experiences are shared, present the city as part of a diverse and globally-networked community.
The Humboldt Laboratory: a living workshop of ideas
Science and cutting-edge research on global challenges – not from a distance, but up close and tangible: the new Humboldt Laboratory, a project of Berlin’s Humboldt University, is a workshop for all those who want to take part in the process of scientific research and discuss global problems and challenges: Climate change, environmental destruction, species extinction and major societal issues. Right at the entrance to the Humboldt Laboratory, visitors are immersed in the world of research via the large model of a school of fish, symbolic of collective intelligence.
From autumn 2021: around 20,000 art objects from Africa, America, Asia and Oceania
Chinese court art, richly decorated houses from Palau, bronze and ivory reliefs from Benin and stelae from Guatemala: from autumn 2021, aesthetically outstanding exhibits from the 5th millennium B.C. to the present day will be presented on the second and third floors of the Humboldt Forum. They come from the world-renowned collections of the Ethological Museum and the Museum of Asian Art in Berlin.
But the unique artefacts will not only present the fascinating traditions of other cultures. A new curation method will also address the circumstances under which they were taken from indigenous communities and the dilemma of the actors on the ground, in short: the difficult history of colonialism and the role of Europe with its after effects felt up to the present day.
History of the site
The two large buildings which previously stood here, one after the other in the 20th century, are a testament to it:
The history of the Humboldt Forum site is symbolic of significant disruptions and upheavals - and Berlin’s eventful history. For many centuries, the magnificent baroque city palace of the Hohenzollern dynasty stood precisely on this site, continually expanded and modified. After it lost its importance when the monarchy came to an end in 1918, it suffered major damage during the Second World War and was demolished in 1950 by order of the GDR leadership. In the 1970s, the GDR government then built its Socialist Palace of the Republic here, which suffered a similar fate after reunification: deprived of its political significance, it fell into disrepair and vanished from the centre of Berlin when it was dismantled in 2008 to make way for the construction of the Humboldt Forum.

But the history of the Humboldt Forum is much, much older than that.
Over 800 years ago...
In the 13th century, the first houses of the medieval twin city of Berlin-Cölln were built on the grounds of the Humboldt Forum. From 1300 onwards, numerous houses were demolished to make room for the construction of a large Dominican monastery. Its archaeological remains are exhibited in the palace cellar of the Humboldt Forum next to the foundations of the baroque palace.  
In 1415, the first members of the Hohenzollern dynasty came to the city. In the following decades, they made their claim to power unmistakably clear to the citizens of Berlin: Elector Friedrich II began building the first palace in the heart of Berlin – against the resistance of the population, who did not want to swap their town for a royal residence. In 1448, they vented all their resentment on the palace’s construction site in a protest:
The Berlin Unwill 1448
A day in medieval Berlin that has gone down in history as the Berlin Unwill: an angry crowd of people gathered at the palace’s construction site and loud shouts resounded. Then, wielding axes and picks, they energetically took to the dam that protected the construction site from being flooded by the Spree. The angry citizens destroyed the dam and masses of water from the Spree flooded the palace square. A success – but only in the short term: penalties were imposed and the palace continued to be built.
Around 500 years of Hohenzollern rule
For half a millennium, Berlin was firmly bound to the Hohenzollern dynasty. And just as the rule of the Hohenzollern dynasty continued to expand – they were kings in Prussia from 1701 and German emperors from 1871 – the city palace was also continually expanded and modernised.
The setting of the Humboldt Forum: historical upheavals after 1918
In 1918, after many centuries of monarchy, the empire came to an end. And the site of today’s Humboldt Forum is once again the focal point of events. The consequences reached far beyond national borders: On 9 November, Karl Liebknecht, accompanied by a large number of demonstrators, proclaimed the Socialist Republic in front of the Hohenzollern Palace. By this time the imperial family had long since fled Berlin and retreated to Potsdam for the time being.
Over the next few years, the palace became home to a wide variety of political, social and cultural institutions – even a student dormitory and a soup kitchen were housed here.
After the Second World War, the palace, destroyed by bombs, was then located in the Soviet Occupation Zone and later on the soil of the newly founded GDR. The new GDR leadership identified the vast site in the heart of Berlin as an ideal location for a symbolic act: the demolition of the palace ruins was intended to erase the memory of the site’s history. The Palace of the Republic was constructed in its place: a multifunctional building which housed the seat of the GDR government for several decades.
This also faced its own downfall after reunification.
The new Humboldt Forum is a cosmopolitan place of discussion and exchange at a location where the history of Berlin and Germany is reflected and consolidated and which has had a highly symbolic character throughout the centuries.",,,"Viewpoints

Berlin",52.5164081,13.393313,History,1,FALSE,Bebelplatz,From the bright dawn of the Enlightenment to the dark days of dictatorship,,,"With its magnificent buildings, Bebelplatz is one of Berlin’s most attractive public squares – and it has also been the scene of some of the city’s chequered history.
Please note: Due to the current situation you are currently obliged to wear a mask with mouth and nose cover on Bebelplatz.
Bebelplatz in the centre of Berlin has seen everything – from the bright dawn of the Enlightenment to the dark days of Nazism. Even today, there are reminders of its turbulent history.
Situated directly by the magnificent boulevard Unter den Linden, it’s quick to get to Bebelplatz. It is one of the most striking and historic squares in Berlin. At Bebelplatz there are notable buildings such as the Staatsoper Unter den Linden, St. Hedwig’s Cathedral, the Hotel de Rome, the Alte Bibliothek, the Altes Palais and the Prinzessinnenpalais. The site was originally called Platz am Opernhaus, and later Kaiser-Franz-Joseph-Platz. Berliners still call it Opernplatz, even though in 1947 the authorities renamed it after the SPD politician August Bebel.
The Forum Fridericianum
The rectangular, completely paved square was built in 1740 after Berlin’s old city fortifications were removed. At the wishes of Friedrich II, the architect von Knobelsdorff planned a new site in the centre of Berlin, the Forum Fridericianum. The new square was to be the centre of the Forum Fridericianum, with the opera house, academy building and royal palace. However, von Knobelsdorff was unable to complete the original plans. At first, only the opera was built, and the site thus became known as Opernplatz. Behind the state opera, the Catholic St. Hedwig’s Cathedral was built in the late 18th century, and on the west side, the Königliche Bibliothek and the Altes Palais were built.
Buildings at Bebelplatz
Staatsoper Unter den Linden
The Staatsoper (State Opera House) was the first dedicated opera house in Germany. Many important artists have taken part in productions there. The building is currently undergoing extensive renovation, which is scheduled to be completed in 2017.
Prinzessinnenpalais
At one time, members of the Hohenzollern family used to live in the palace, but it now belongs to a media group. The palace originally consisted of two buildings, which were joined together and later impressively extended. Karl Friedrich Schinkel built the floor construction which connects the building to the neighbouring Kronprinzenpalais.
St. Hedwig’s Cathedral
Friedrich II built St. Hedwig’s Cathedral for the Catholic community as a sign of religious tolerance. Today, the church with its striking dome is the seat of the archbishopric of Berlin and thus the city’s most important Catholic religious building.  
Altes Palais
The Altes Palais was once the city residence of the Kings of Prussia and the German Emperors. Wilhelm I used to appear at the window for the changing of the guard, which attracted onlookers and was even mentioned in travel guides of the time. The building now belongs to Berlin’s Humboldt University as part of its Faculty of Law.
Hotel de RomeThe former headquarters of Dresdner Bank was built in the late 19th century in the Italian Renaissance style, and now contains offices and the luxury Hotel de Rome.
Alte Bibliothek
Built in the late 18th century, the curved baroque forms of the library earned it the nickname of the “Commode”. Friedrich II built the library to make scientific knowledge accessible to citizens. Its shelves contained works of the enlightenment such as books by Diderot, Rousseau, Voltaire, Kant and Leibniz, and it was the largest library in the German-speaking world. Once the building could no longer accommodate its collection, the Staatsbibliothek Unter den Linden was built.   
The book burning
On 10 May 1933, Opernplatz became infamous in the annals of history. Members of the Nazi German Student Union organised a book burning, throwing important works of world literature onto the fire. Works by authors such as Heinrich and Thomas Mann, Erich Kästner, Stefan Zweig, Heinrich Heine, Karl Marx and Kurt Tucholsky were all burnt. Many of the authors denounced as decadent and un-German had already left Germany and gone into exile. Unnoticed, Erich Kästner watched his book Fabian go up in flames.
The memorial to the book burning
Since 1995, a underground memorial by Micha Ullmann has reminded visitors of the book burnings. Behind a glass plate in the middle of Bebelplatz, a library with empty shelves is set into the ground.
The inscription quotes Heinrich Heine: “That was but a prelude; where they burn books, they will ultimately burn people as well.”",,,,https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/styles/visitberlin_bleed_header_visitberlin_mobile_1x/private/image/Humboldt-Uni_Bebelplatz_iStock_c_Mag_Mac_DL_PPT_0.jpg?h=d1f6bb1a&itok=D6mVOd7P,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/bebelplatz,,,,

The scent of the rose garden is magical. In the middle of Berlin’s Gesundbrunnen district, Volkspark Humboldthain is a green oasis. But looks deceive – this park is an adventure playground!
Parks, gardens and bunker hills
Volkspark Humboldthain is a memorial garden, originally conceived by the landscape architect Gustav Meyer. The park was named after the great natural historian Alexander von Humboldt. Work began on 14 September 1869, the 100th anniversary of Humboldt’s birth. Seven years later the park was completed.
In the Second World War, Humboldthain was a major target for air raids because of the bunkers and anti-aircraft guns set up there. After the war, razed areas and bomb craters left very little sign of the original layout, so Berliners turned the situation to the park’s advantage. The bunkers were filled in, and gradually vegetation grew over them. Rubble was piled up to form a toboggan run and the hill now known as the Humboldthöhe, which is now an excellent viewing platform. A society called Berliner Unterwelten e.V. has reopened some of the underground parts of the demolished flak tower and offers guided tours in summer. In winter, the rooms are inhabited by around 250 bats of six different species, which makes the bunker the third-largest winter shelter for bats in Berlin.
Climbing, jogging, swimming: leisure activities in Humboldthain
The north wall of the big bunker and the south wall of the smaller one are used by the Berlin section of the German Alpine Association (DAV) for competitive climbing to the highest degree of difficulty. But don’t worry, there are also paths for walkers and joggers to get up the hill. On the edge of the park, on Wiesenstraße, are the Humboldthain open air swimming baths. With diving boards, a slide and a paddling pool, there’s fun for swimmers of all ages.
If you like it a bit more relaxed, at Humboldthain, just like in Kreuzberg, there is a vineyard whose harvest is getting more successful each year due to climate change. Every year, around 200 bottles of wine are produced. Its grapes are also used to make Humboldthainer Hauptstadtsekt, but the capital city’s sparking wine is not for sale: it’s only served on special municipal occasions.",,,"Parks & gardens

Berlin",52.5899255,13.2784972,Architecture,2,FALSE,IBA buildings in Alt-Tegel,Standing at Tegel harbour are residential and cultural buildings in postmodern design which have a close connection to the water.,,,"The 1987 International Building Exhibition (IBA) was a large-scale project to upgrade West Berlin's housing stock. In contrast to the urban development concepts of the 1950s to 1970s, the construction of new residential areas was no longer the issue at that time. Instead, the focus was on the renovation of old buildings and the integration of new houses into the existing inner city.
 One of the IBA projects that attracted a lot of international attention was located at the old Tegel harbour.
New residential quarter in Alt-Tegel
At the IBA, a particular focus lay on the planning of neighbourhoods that offered both living space as well as cultural and leisure opportunities. The open spaces at the former Tegel harbour, which had been derelict for years, were perfectly suited for the realisation of such a project.
The design by the American team of architects Charles Moore, John Rube and Buzz Yudell won the competition. They defined water as the central element of the neighbourhood. Instead of a plain development on the shore, they planned to enlarge the harbour basin and build up an artificial island. Cultural and leisure facilities were intended to be created there, but these did not go beyond the draft phase. Newly built residential buildings have been standing on Tegeler Insel since 2013.
A promenade on the shore of the harbour basin invites visitors to go for a walk. Behind it begins the residential area with different building forms – from wave-like, meandering row buildings in social housing construction, to elegant residential courtyards and detached urban villas. Only the residential courtyards, which invoke historical models in the sense of postmodern architecture,
 stem from Moore, Rube and Yudell: examples include gate systems as in the Middle Ages and semicircular façades as in the Renaissance.
Postmodern Humboldt Library
Picking up on historical elements and combining them anew is an important creative means of postmodern architecture. It thus sets itself in direct contrast to the guiding principle of Classical Modernism, ""Form follows function"". In postmodern times, on the other hand, the principle goes ""Form follows fiction"" – everything is allowed.
This is also reflected in the Humboldt Library planned by Charles Moore, which forms part of the cultural institutions at Tegel harbour. Its façade alludes to classicist architecture with glass surfaces and stone pillars. Inside, the library offers an impressive wooden ceiling spanning three vaults that evokes associations with sacred architecture. The visitor is reminded of monasteries with their extensive libraries – an effect that is further enhanced by Baroque-style decorative elements on the bookshelves.
In addition to its core function, the Humboldt Library also serves as a cultural centre where exhibitions, readings and concerts take place.
Even though there were numerous deviations from the original winning design of the competition, the IBA neighbourhood has proved very popular with its residents. Its location by the waterfront, the promenade and the cultural offerings of the Humboldt Library have all contributed to a high quality of life at Tegel harbour.
Our tips for nearby the IBA buildings in Alt-Tegel
After strolling along the promenade of Tegel harbour and taking a closer look at the Humboldt Library, why not walk to the Greenwich Promenade and sit on a restaurant terrace when the weather is fine.

The + represents other contemporary artists such as the painter and wood sculptor Lutz Friedel and multimedia artist Constantino Ciervo.

Tour through the collection
Collector Henry Liman has a fondness for Fluxus and has put together a fantastic collection. In 2008, he opens the first museum of modern art in Potsdam. Liman personally selects artists for the exhibitions. Spread across two floors over 1000 square metres, the rooms are designed in stark white. The tour begins on the ground floor where the Fluxus movement is presented through the works of exponents such as Ben Patterson, Emmett Williams and Nam June Paik. You'll find broken music instruments, abstract paintings and even hearing installations. Artist Wolf Vostell is the big hit on the first floor. Born in Rhineland-Palatinate in 1932, he is regarded as a pioneer of installations and happenings. His works and career are documented under the motto Life is art. Art is life. In his work Transmigration, the viewer can watch flickering TV through a crack in the canvas. There's more art in store - watch out for Costantino Ciervo's typewriter installation, the contrasting paintings by Hella de Santarossa or Lutz Friedel's composition Das nächtliche Atelier (Nightly Studio). Once back in the foyer, have a tea at the Museum Cafe or visit the shop.

The cult of the Trabant has been going strong for more than 25 years. In 2013, a museum dedicated to this iconic car opens at Checkpoint Charlie on the ground floor of a huge 19th century building, with the aim of preserving the history of East German car making. In 1958 the first model rolls off the production line, somewhat reminiscent of the VW Beetle. Trabants are displayed in chronological order, including the rare P50 and P60 models. The classic Trabant is the 601, which survives all the way up to the reunification of Germany. All variations and colours of the 601 are on display, including the campervan model. Look out for rare Trabi rally cars, military vehicles, jeeps and police cars. For a while, you'll be transported back to the GDR. The museum's oldest vehicle is the DKW, dating from the 1930s.

In the following years, fairs and exhibitions became more important. Even today, the Funkturm is surrounded by Berlin’s biggest exhibition grounds. In 1935, a fire in the exhibition halls destroyed parts of the tower. But not even wartime bombs could bring down the tower – even though it only stood on three legs for a while.
The 600-tonne giant was repaired and restored after the war. Every twelve years it gets a new coat of metal paint, making it another 9 kilograms heavier. In strong winds, the tip of the tower can move up to 40 centimetres. But don’t worry: it’s never broken off. 
The view from the Funkturm
These days the Langer Lulatsch is used as a transmitter for the local police and mobile phone network. But it’s also a place where tourists come for a bird’s-eye view of the city. The Funkturm is 150 metres high, and you can go all the way up to the viewing platform at 126 metres, where you are rewarded by a fantastic view of the western city centre. Only 287 steps up from the ground is the restaurant platform, where you can take a break and build up strength for the remaining 360 steps to the viewing platform. If you’re already worn out from all your sightseeing in Berlin, you can always take the glass lift. 
Dining with a difference
Fancy an oxtail soup or a fillet of plaice 55 metres above the ground? Just take a look at the lunch menu at the Funkturm restaurant. With a different themed gourmet buffet every month, there’s something for connoisseurs in the evening too. The Art Nouveau décor will make you feel like you’re dining in the Roaring Twenties.","Opening hours

Work began on the Olympiastadion in 1934 in preparation for the 1936 Summer Olympics. It had a capacity of 100,000 and was designed by the architect Werner March. Its clear geometric lines were inspired by the sporting arenas of ancient times. Because everything but the upper tier is set below ground level, the stadium does not look as imposing from the outside as some of the other buildings constructed during the Nazi era.
Another part of what used to be the Reichssportfeld became the Maifeld, created as a site for propaganda rallies. There is also the Waldbühne, reminiscent of an ancient amphitheatre and built for the 1936 Olympic gymnastic events. Today, it is a venue for open-air concerts in its woodland surroundings.

The bell tower in the Olympiapark
Another building on the complex is the bell tower in the Olympiapark, where you can enjoy a beautiful view of the city, the impressive Olympiastadion and the Grunewald forest. On a clear day you can even see as far as Potsdam. And you don’t even have to climb steps because a lift takes you up to the viewing platform in comfort.

A history trail on the Olympic site with 45 panels in German and English tells you about the beginnings and history of the former Reichssportfeld, and of the historical buildings and artworks from the early Nazi period.

Due to the size of the new residential complex, the “olympischer Hügel” (Olympic Hill) next to the Olympic Stadium on the edge of Grunewald Forest was selected as the site.

One of the largest industrial sites in Berlin is located in Wedding, between Brunnenstraße, Gustav-Meyer-Allee, Voltastraße and Hussitenstraße: the former site of electrical company AEG am Humboldthain. Even if only parts of the former industrial complex have been preserved, there is still a sense of how important it once was. The listed site with the impressive assembly hall on Hussitenstraße demonstrates the importance of the electrical industry for the development of Berlin.
Berlin as Electropolis
It addition to mechanical engineering, it was the electrical industry that had a key influence on the industrial development of Berlin. The Berlin-based companies in the electrical industry gave rise to Berlin as an industrial metropolis after 1890. Indeed, Berlin became the electropolis! The rapid rise of the electrical industry was driven primarily by the electrical company AEG. In just a few years after starting in 1895, the company built a complex on Brunnenstraße that was enormous by the standards of the time: the factories of AEG am Humboldthain. These plants manufactured electrically-powered motors and machinery, railway equipment, electrical equipment and installation materials, as well as electronic household items of all kinds.
AEG am Humboldthain
The first buildings on the AEG site at Humboldthain were erected in the late nineteenth century, but the only surviving structure is what is named Beamtentor (""clerks' gate) designed by architect Franz Schwechten in 1896. The other buildings that remain standing were largely built to designs by architect Peter Behrens starting in 1910. They reflect fundamental changes in industrial architecture and paved the way for the history of twentieth-century architecture. Behrens developed a monumental style with strict, clearly ordered lines without any ornament. In addition to dark red brick, he also used bluish brick containing iron oxide on the façade which helped make the buildings stand out clearly from the surrounding residential area. One of the most impressive buildings on the former AEG site is the large machine assembly hall. Built in 1911/12 to plans by Peter Behrens, it is one of the largest factories of Berlin.
From AEG Site to Technology and Innovation Park
Electric devices continued to be produced in the factories on Brunnenstraße until 1983. After the site was abandoned, the buildings on the eastern half were demolished. The remaining factories are now used as the Technologie- und Innovationspark Berlin (TIP) by departments of the Technical University of Berlin, commercial enterprises and media companies.

Its lavishly decorated banqueting halls are as fascinating now as they were when it was built.",,,"Friedrich II built the imposing Neues Palais as a symbol of prestige at the opposite end of the palace gardens. After the Seven Years’ War from 1756 to 1763 it was designed to show his neighbours and enemies that they had better take Prussia’s new power seriously.

Unlike the small and intimate Sanssouci, the new palace was therefore a bombastic edifice with long suites of rooms, and lavishly decorated banqueting halls and galleries. The builders worked in record time, unconcerned about cutting corners here and there. In cash-struck Prussia, they also had to imitate expensive brickwork. Even so, or perhaps precisely because of this, the Neues Palais as something you simply must see.

The history of the Neues Palais

Friedrich II himself called the Neues Palais a vainglorious boast. He preferred the intimacy of Sanssouci, and used the impressive new palace to house his guests and hold lavish banquets. He had apartments furnished for members of his family – but not for his wife. Queen Elisabeth Christine was not welcome at court and lived separately from the king – although officially performing her role as queen – at Schloss Schönhausen. After the death of Friedrich II, his successors gradually installed more modern conveniences such as electric lighting, bathrooms with toilets and in 1903, a lift. Kaiser Wilhelm II, well-known as a lover of bombast, liked to use the Neues Palais as a summer residence. In winter, the huge building was cold and draughty, so his wife Auguste Viktoria had to bathe in the cupboard to avoid the chill.

After the fall of the monarchy in 1918 and the abdication of the Kaiser, the Neues Palais became a museum. The interior furnishings were looted in 1945 by Soviet troops.

The architecture of the Neues Palais

The large, three-winged palace looks impressive from the outside, but the red-brick façade was a painted imitation to save money. It was built in the Late Baroque fashion, even though that style was already outdated. The roof is decorated with a dome and many sculptures – 292 all told.

The dome is also pure decoration, with no dome-roofed hall under it.

The Communs

Behind the palace building are the Communs, utility buildings connected to the palace by an underground passage.

The Schlosstheater

The Schlosstheater is a particularly fine example of Rococo theatre architecture. The building is red and white, decorated with gilded ornaments. Plays are still performed on the small stage today. After years of renovation work, the Schlosstheater in the Neues Palais is scheduled to reopen in June 2020 with a performance of the Potsdam Sanssouci Music Festival.

Banqueting halls and galleries

Inside the huge palace, its two hundred rooms, royal apartments and four galleries are decorated in the exuberant Rococo style. The most eccentric of the halls that Friedrich II used to impress his guests is probably the Grottensaal (Grotto Hall), where, following extensive restoration, more than 24,000 seashells, minerals, fossils and gemstones glitter and sparkle in all their original glory.

The Marmorgalerie (Marble Gallery), with its marble cladding and gold-framed ceiling paintings is a particularly fine example of Prussian Rococo, that you shouldn’t miss. The opulent marble hall is open to visitors again after extensive renovation.

UNESCO world heritage site

The Neues Palais belongs to the UNESCO world heritage site known as the Parks and Palaces of Potsdam and Berlin. The cultural landscape in Potsdam and the south of Berlin is an assembly of incomparable beauty and harmony – no wonder that they call it Prussia’s Arcadia.

At the Neues Palais you can also find the Café & Restaurant Fredersdorf, where you can enjoy fresh, contemporary cuisine in majestic surroundings.

The Cathedral Church is dominated by a monumental dome crowned by a lantern with a golden cross and flanked by four towers. Raschdorff drew his inspiration from the Italian High Renaissance and the more florid baroque style. With its lavish mix of ornamental mosaics, gold features and impressive statues, the interior is clearly informed by the late nineteenth century’s love of grand gestures and display. The most notable works of art are the marble and onyx altar, designed by 
Friedrich August Stüler, and the white marble baptismal font by Christian Daniel Rauch. In the Baptismal and Matrimonial Chapel, the monumental painting of the Descent of the Holy Spirit by Carl Begas in the style of Raphael is also well worth seeing.
Visiting the Cathedral Church
Every 20 minutes there are guided tours of the Berlin Cathedral, which are included in the entrance fee. Here you sit in the bank rows and receive exciting information from the cathedral guides.
The main nave with the massive dome soaring above it is certainly one of the church’s signature sights, and not to be missed. In contrast, the simpler Baptismal and Matrimonial Chapel is far more meditative, inviting visitors to stop, rest and reflect. In the Hohenzollern crypt, which has been closed for three years since 1 March 2020 for reconstruction and renovation work, is the most important dynastic sepulchre in Germany. It contains nearly 100 sarcophagi and burial monuments from five centuries. Some are plain and simple, while others are extremely ornate as, for example, the sarcophagi under the galleries in the upper church room carved by Andreas Schlüter for Friedrich I and Queen Sophie Charlotte, which are ranked as masterpieces of baroque sculpture.
Emperor Frederick William II, however, did not find his last rest in his church, but in Dutch exile.
The museum showcases drawings, designs and models illustrating the history of the Cathedral Church. In particular, the walk-in models give an impressive sense of the church interior. And to get a marvellous impression of the exterior, you can climb 270 steps to the dome’s outer walkway – and be rewarded by some stunning panoramic views! The richly decorated Imperial Staircase was intended for the use of the German Emperor. The stairwell comes with an American-made elevator 
included at the wish of Kaiser Wilhelm II, an enthusiastic follower of new technologies. The staircase and elevator are only accessible to visitors on special occasions.
There is no viewing of the Cathedral Church during religious services and events.

Concerts in the Cathedral Church
It is quite an experience to visit a concert in this magnificent setting. The rich tones of the historic organ, one of the most famous by the renowned Sauer organ builders, can be heard during services and special concerts. Visitors can view this impressive musical instrument in detail on the dedicated organ tours. The Cathedral Church is also home to two outstanding choirs, the Domkantorei and the Staats- und Domchor Berlin, which provide choral accompaniment for the services and perform individual concerts. With its strong and vibrant musical tradition, the Cathedral Church offers a regular programme of concerts, including the highlight of the International Organ Summer an concerts in the Advent and christmas season.
The magnificent dome of the Cathedral Church (Berliner Dom) is one of the main landmarks in Berlin’s cityscape – and marks the spot of the impressive basilica housing the city’s most important Protestant church. With its elaborate decorative and ornamental designs, the church interior is especially worth seeing.
Yet although the church is known as a cathedral, it actually has the status of a parish church – though not just any parish. This was a representative stage for the Hohenzollern dynasty, the rulers of Prussia and later the German Emperors. Today, as the High Parish and Cathedral Church, the church serves the Protestant community in Berlin and the surrounding areas. The congregation is not based on place of residence, but open through admission to all baptised Protestants in the region.
History
The history of the Berlin Cathedral goes back to the 15th century. The predecessor buildings were originally part of the Berlin City Palace.
In the early nineteenth century, Prussia’s leading architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel transformed the court church into a neo-classical building. But fifty years on, tastes had changed. By the time Wilhelm II came to throne as Emperor of Germany in 1888, several designs had been proposed for a new church, though none had been accepted. The Emperor also found the Schinkel church far too modest, and insisted on a new monumental church in keeping with the imperial monarchy’s power and prestige. Architect Julius Carl Raschdorff was commissioned for the new church, but had to present three designs before Wilhelm II was satisfied. Raschdorff’s opulent, grandiose structure was for him Berlin’s answer to Saint Peter’s in Rome and Saint Paul’s Cathedral in London.
The old building was demolished in 1893, and the foundation stone for the new church laid in 1894. Eleven years later in 1905, the new church was consecrated. The church was severely damaged during the Second World War. After the division of Germany, the Cathedral Church was in East Berlin. The work on restoring the church began there in 1975, although in a simplified form.
The full restoration was only completed in 1993, four years after the Berlin Wall fell. Finally, in 2008, a new golden cross replaced the dome cross in need of renovation. Today, the old cross is located on one of the cathedral cemeteries in Liesenstraße 6.","September - February: Monday - Saturday 9 am - 7 pm, Sunday 12 am - 7 pm

Without a show of pomp and circumstance, but with considerable personal discipline, he guided the fate of Prussia in the eighteenth century. His beloved summer palace was his ideal of everyone’s wish of living without a care – Sans souci.

On a small rise covered with vineyard terraces near Potsdam, Friedrich had his Sanssouci summer palace constructed in 1745 –1747. This was not merely a summer residence and his favourite place to stay. It also became a personal sanctuary, a place where he retreated in times of difficulties to relax in the company of his dogs. Friedrich was reluctant to have even minor repairs on the palace. Sanssouci was his private refuge and, as he said, “should only last my lifetime”.

Fortunately, though, his wish did not come true. Today, Sanssouci has lost none of its special magic and charm. The intimate suites of rooms still have their original elegant designs and furnishings. And the spreading park and grounds, with the stately Neues Palais (New Palace), the Neue Kammern (New Chambers), the Chinese House, Orangery, and the Charlottenhof Palace, are more impressive and beautiful than ever.

When he died, Friedrich wanted to be interred at Sanssouci Palace in a crypt on the uppermost terrace of the vineyard, close to where his much-loved greyhounds were buried. But it was many years before this wish was granted – not until his reburial there in 1991. Now, the “Philosopher of Sanssouci”, as he was popularly known, is at peace on the highest terrace of the hill.

Sanssouci Palace – History

In 1745, Friedrich II commissioned his architect Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff to build him a small summer palace. Finished just two years later, it was set above a terraced vineyard with trellises and glazed niches, all laid out at the same time. There are also two other buildings to the right and left of the palace: the Neue Kammern (New Chambers), which Friedrich had constructed as a guest house, and the Picture Gallery with works by Rubens, Caravaggio and Tintoretto.

Later, Friedrich Wilhelm IV had the two wings enlarged. In 1873, Wilhelm I opened the palace as a museum – as one of the very first palace museums in Germany. Sanssouci survived the Second World War unscathed, though some of the art works and furniture removed for safe keeping went missing.

The palace is elegant rather than opulent – after all, it was intended as a summer residence, a retreat to enjoy the country air. In contrast to the baroque splendour of the stately Neues Palais (New Palace) at the other end of the park, Sanssouci is informed by the lighter spirit of the rococo. And with this little palace only comprising twelve rooms, it was clearly designed for intimacy rather than show.

The entire complex with its palaces and park is inscribed as UNESCO World Heritage, recognised as “an outstanding example of architectural creations and landscaping” and “a cultural property of exceptional quality”.

A question of perspective

As you approach Sanssouci Palace from the park, you will notice that no matter where you stand, you cannot see all of Sanssouci at once. Knobelsdorff, Friedrich’s architect, would have liked the palace to stand out from below – as a classic sovereign display of power. But Friedrich was more interested in direct access to the terrace, and a feeling of living close to nature.

Sanssouci Park

The garden at the base of the terraces is baroque in style, with a large, central fountain. In the nineteenth century, Peter Joseph Lenné, Prussia’s leading landscape gardener, was commissioned to lay out the spreading park grounds. The park has many delightful decorative features, including the Neptune Grotto by Knobelsdorff, the small round neo-classical Temple of Friendship, which Friedrich built in memory of his favourite sister, and the Great Fountain. The Chinese House is a wonderful mix of rococo and chinoiserie, complete with three gilded figures. The interesting features nearby include the Historic Mill, set close to the Sanssouci Palace and grounds. For a stunning view of the area, it is well worth visiting the Norman Tower on the Ruinenberg hill and the two Belvederes – the Belvedere on Klausberg hill and the Belvedere on Pfingstberg hill.

The Orangery Palace, built in an Italianate style by Wilhelm IV, renowned as the “Romantic on the throne”, was the last building constructed in the park. Here, the sensitive plants in tubs spend winter in the plant halls. The main palace hall is naturally more ornate, and decorated by copies of Raphael’s works. The taste for an Italianate architectural style is also evident in the Roman Baths and the Friedenskirche (Church of Peace). The former royal Charlottenhof Palace, designed jointly by architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel and landscape designer Peter Joseph Lenné, offers a fascinating mix of architecture and landscaping.

Potsdam – Night of the Palaces

Once a year in summer, the park is transformed into a vast stage for events. The sounds of classical music and jazz melodies echo through the nightime park, and the event closes with a spectacular firework display, lighting up the night.

Tickets for Sanssouci Palace

With the sanssouci+ tickets, available in all Berlin Tourist Infos, you can visit a wide selection of Prussian palaces and parks, including Sanssouci in Potsdam (except Sacrow Palace and Jagdschloss Stern in Potsdam; except the special exhibitions; reduced admission to the Belvedere on Pfingstberg).

Berlin",52.5264862,13.3944418,Gallery,2,FALSE,Former Jewish Girls’ School,“House of Art and Dining Culture”,,,"The Jewish community once stretched from Auguststraße to the synagogue in Oranienburger Straße, and one of its final building projects before the Nazis took power in 1933, was the Jewish Girls’ School in Berlin-Mitte undertaken between 1927 and 1928. The school building, located at Auguststraße 11-13, consists of a five-storey front building with a long side wing along the courtyard and a tower-shaped body along the street façade faced with red iron clinker. The historical monument is characterised by late expressionist elements which merge with the New Objectivity style. The horizontal window casements aligned rigorously along the brick guides give the impression of a horizontally layered arrangement of the building’s structure. The architect of the Girls’ School, Alexander Beer, also designed other buildings for the Jewish community, including the Orphans’ House in Pankow and the synagogue on Fraenkelufer. He was murdered in the Theresienstadt concentration camp a year before the Second World War ended. The history of the Jewish Girls’ School was dominated by the Nazi regime from the very early days following its initial occupation in 1930. Deportations were even carried out in the courtyard in 1941. The next year the school was closed and taken over by the Catholic St. Hedwig’s Hospital until the end of the war. It was only in the middle of the 1950s that the building was again used by a secondary school for its original purpose. In 1966, when its function as a school yet again ended due to a lack of pupils, the building was handed over to the Jewish community. From that time the 3,300 square metre (35,500 ft²) building stood empty for many decades. Not until 2006 was a use found for it when the 4th Berlin Biennale was held there to great acclaim. And then finally, five years later, it came to life again when the gallery owner Michael Fuchs rented the former school from the Jewish community on a 30-year lease. A complete year of desperately needed renovation on account of the decades of standing empty, carried out by the architects Armand Grüntuch and Almut Ernsnum, helped the building to rediscover its original charm, and in February 2012 the former Jewish Girls’ School reopened as “Haus der Kunst und Esskultur” (House of Art and Dining Culture). Besides the Michael Fuchs Gallery, which is moving into the former Aula on the third floor, the historical monument will also become home to the Eigen+Art Lab to be another of gallery owner Harry Lybke’s locations. In addition, the Camera Work Photo-Gallery based in Charlottenburg is opening a Camera Work Contemporary Gallery in the former classrooms on the first floor as a second mainstay. The icing on the cake to compliment this location for contemporary art and gastronomy is being provided by an exclusive culinary project, as the “Royal Grill” team, inspired by the Golden Twenties, is opening the “Pauly Saal” Restaurant as well as the “Pauly Bar”. Next door, “The Kosher Classroom” includes in its menu traditional Sabbath dinners, while a piece of New York dining culture has also moved in – in the form of “Mogg”.
Cultural Setting
The immediate neighbourhood of the former Jewish Girls’ School is also rich in highlights. Diagonally opposite on the other side of the street is the Kunst-Werke (Art Works) Berlin, Institute for Contemporary Art, which presents national and international contemporary culture in the form of exhibitions, artists’ studios and events. The Café Bravo, situated in the inner courtyard of this listed building built in the 18th century, is at the same time the first accessible sculpture by the American artist Dan Graham. And connected to the building complex of the KW – Institute for Contemporary Art Berlin you will find the Me Collectors Room Berlin. Following various renovations in this residential and exhibition house, the “Gerhard Richter – Editions 1954-2011” exhibition is being held here from 12th February to 13th May. You can also visit the Wunderkammer Olbricht (Olbricht’s Chamber of Curiosities) here, which with some 150 Renaissance and Baroque exhibits is one of the most important private collections of its kind. The C/O Berlin – International Forum For Visual Dialogues has also established itself in the immediate vicinity, and is dedicated to contemporary photography with changing exhibitions of international artists. You can visit the photography exhibitions in the former Imperial Postfuhramt (Post Office) up to the autumn of 2012, after which C/O Berlin is relocating to the studio houses in Monbijoupark. Just a few houses further on, you can visit dance events or attend dance courses every evening (according to its motto) in Clärchens Ballhaus – one of the last preserved ballrooms of the 1920s, or stop off at the adjoining restaurant to enjoy Italian and German cuisine. And last but by no means least; let’s not forget a visit to the Jewish community itself. The history of the Jews in Berlin and its environs is depicted in the process of coming to terms with the past in events and changing exhibitions in the New Synagogue. In addition, the New Synagogue’s permanent exhibition “Tuet auf die Pforten” conveys to its guests the architectural history of the building.",,,"Architecture

It is a fascinating place full of history, and full of stories.",,,"An enchanted place, like a maze in a jungle. Overgrown paths with sunken gravestones – silent except for occasional birdsong. Shady trees over the graves and columns and monumental mausoleums. A place full of history and a place full of stories. The Jüdischer Friedhof Weißensee is the biggest Jewish cemetery in Europe. The large site is bedecked with trees that make it look like something out of a fairy tale. There are more than 100,000 graves in the cemetery.

It is the final resting place of many well-known Berliners, including the painter Lesser Ury, the composer Louis Lewandowski, the department store founder Oscar Tietz, and the publishers Samuel Fischer and Rudolf Mosse.

History of the cemetery
In 1880, the Jewish community in Berlin established the cemetery in Weißensee because the existing one in Schönhauser Allee had run out of space. As well as simple graves, there were also magnificent mausoleums, a sign of the new-found self-confidence among Berlin’s assimilated Jews.  Under the Nazis, some Jews hid from persecution in the mausoleums on the sprawling site. Jews who had been living illegally in Berlin were secretly buried at the cemetery.

After the war, the Jewish community in Berlin was divided. East Berlin only had a small Jewish community and it was not until the 1970s that the East Berlin parliament designated the cemetery a cultural and historical memorial. There were plans to build an elevated highway over it, until Erich Honecker was persuaded to stop them by Heinz Galinski, the chairman of the Jewish congregation in West Berlin.

Restoration work has begun on the site in recent years.

Memorials
Just behind the main entrance, a memorial in the courtyard commemorates the victims of the Shoah. Inside a circle stands a memorial stone with an inscription that translates as “Remember forever what happened to us. Dedicated to the memory of our murdered brothers and sisters 1933 – 1945 and to the living, who shall fulfil the legacy of the dead. – The Jewish Community of Berlin”. The circle around the memorial stone contains slabs inscribed with the names of the concentration and extermination camps.

The cemetery also contains an urn field where the ashes of people who died in the concentration camps are buried. Gravestones commemorate the dead who have no grave of their own. Behind it is the monument honouring Jewish soldiers who fell in the first world war. A plaque by the graves of honour commemorates Herbert Baum and his group of anti-Fascist resistance fighters.

The film Im Himmel, unter der Erde (In Heaven, Under The Ground) directed by Britta Wauer is an affectionate and informative account of the cemetery and the people who made it what it is.

Digital guide
A digital guide, which you can call up in English or German using a QR code, tells you the story of the cemetery, the graves and the people buried there. You can also find information at www.juedische-friedhoefe-berlin.de. The guide includes the Jewish cemeteries in Große Hamburger Straße, Schönhauser Allee and Weißensee.

Please note that men may not go bare-headed. Kippot can be borrowed at the entrance.

Weißensee
Weißensee is an increasingly popular neighbourhood: young families, creative people and retired people appreciate the green surroundings complete with bathing beach. Take a stroll through the area and have a bite to eat at one of the newly opened cafés.","Opening hours (additional information)

Please note: The current opening and closing hours and special hygiene rules for the Covid-19 are available on this website.

The German sculptress and graphic artist Käthe Kollwitz boasts a poignant oeuvre that focuses on social inequality and the fight against war. This museum houses 200 drawings and prints, sculptural works, as well as the famous woodcut series about the war. The heart of the collection is a series of self portraits spanning 50 years.

Never again war: An artist of the workers and the peace movement
When Käthe Kollwitz moves to Berlin in the 19th century, she lives in the working class district of Prenzlauer Berg. As the wife of a socially committed doctor, she is no stranger to suffering, poverty and hunger. She is concerned with social inequality and war resistance, and these themes are expressed in her work. She dies in Moritzburg near Dresden in 1945. Three years later, the art dealer Hans Pels-Leusden collects her drawings, and in 1986, he exhibits his collection, and the Käthe-Kollwitz-Museum Berlin opens.
The works are housed in a bourgeois, late-classic villa in Fasanenstraße in Berlin-Charlottenburg. As soon as you enter, you get a feeling of emerging industrial life in the city. The permanent exhibition captures the zeitgeist of the period very well. Visitors also get to know Kollwitz's role models and friends, like for instance Max Liebermann. From the staircase onwards, a biographical guide takes you to the first floor where information about Kollwitz's work up until WW1 awaits.
Then comes the second part of the exhibition. Between 1914 and 1945, Kollwitz creates some of the most important graphics and sculptures of her time, particularly the lithographs in the form of 15 large printed posters. Towards the end of her life, the artist struggles heavily with the theme of death in her work. On the brightly lit top floor, the stunning Käthe Kollwitz sculpture by Gustav Seitz, measuring over two metres, is a sight to behold.

As soon as you enter, you can feel the special atmosphere of the chapel: the quiet of this simple room, the modern cross at the open clay altar with its opened Bible. The building is dedicated to the 
many victims who lost their lives at the Berlin Wall. Biographical devotions from Tuesday to Friday at 12.00 p.m. recall the individual fates of these 138 people. Every Saturday the devotions at 12.00 p.m. conclude with a midday prayer in which the Coventry Litany of Reconciliation is recited.
A contribution to peace and reconciliation
Since 1999, the chapel on the grounds of the Berlin Wall Memorial has been part of the worldwide Cross of Nails Community dedicated to promoting peace and reconciliation between peoples. At regular intervals, the Saturday devotions include a commemoration of the individual fates of those who fled and died at the present-day border of the European Union. The misery of the border and the pain of partition are as palpable here as the joy of the Peaceful Revolution and the happiness of reunification.
The old church was blown up
Until 1985 an old church stood here which from 1961 onwards was within the death strip and was thus inaccessible to the people of the East and the West, and which was finally blown up by order of the GDR government. Today’s Chapel of Reconciliation not only bears the name of its predecessor built in 1894 but also contains rubble from its walls. The preserved altar retable with its heavily damaged depiction of the Last Supper hangs in exactly the same place as in the old church. The former sandstone altar plate was visibly embedded in the clay floor as a memorial and a foundation for the new altar.
From field of death to field of rye
From the outside colonnade a field of rye can be seen on either side of the chapel: a sign of life. Here, on the border of the Cold War, the field of death became farmland once again in 2005. Seeds from Bernauer Strasse were used to sow a further twelve fields of rye from the Baltic to Bulgaria, each at a site commemorating a painful period of history.",,,Memorials,https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/styles/visitberlin_bleed_header_visitberlin_mobile_1x/private/image/Kapelle_der_Versoehnun_innen_Foto_Thomas_Jeutner_DL_PPT_0.jpg?h=2f83cd36&itok=gbQDtCsD,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/chapel-reconciliation,,,,

Berlin",52.5200993,13.4232501,Architecture,2,FALSE,Karl-Marx-Allee – second construction phase,East Berlin’s town planners received a decree: their Stalinist “wedding-cake” architecture was no longer desired.,,,"Times change: In 1954 the dictator Stalin had been dead for a year and Nikita Khrushchev was in power as the new Soviet head of state. This influenced politics and city architecture, also in the GDR.
Stalinallee between Frankfurter Tor and Strausberger Platz is characterised by residential palaces: buildings with modern fittings and neo-classical façades. Yet these came at a price. For the city’s model building, the Hochhaus an der Weberwiese, the construction costs for each apartment were nine times higher than average. This was much too expensive for the millions of homes needed after the destruction of the Second World War. The quality of the buildings was also often inadequate: the first ceramic tiles began to fall off only a few years after the façades had been completed.
Hermann Henselmann, East Berlin’s head architect, did not initially receive any new instructions. In the past, the architect had attempted to build modern, clean-cut and functional buildings in the GDR, but without success. At that time he had to adapt to the dominant style and find a German form of expression for Socialist Classicism.

State of the art
In 1957, as a reaction to the buildings on Stalinallee, West Berlin hosted the architectural exhibition
 Interbau in Hansaviertel. International architects constructed housing developments there according to modern standards. The wedding-cake palaces were not only too expensive, they also made the GDR appear behind the times. And so the GDR realised that its own architecture must find a 
connection with the modern era.
Henselmann saw this as a new opportunity. In 1958, he published his plans for the second construction phase on Stalinallee, between Strausberger Platz and Alexanderplatz, in which his clean-cut and functional ideas came into effect. However, he committed a strategic mistake by calling for a 
reversal of Socialist architecture before the SED Politbüro had announced it. As a result, he lost his position as head architect.
After Henselmann’s dismissal, other architects were given responsibility for the second phase of construction on Karl-Marx-Allee, as Stalinallee was renamed in late 1961. These were primarily Josef Kaiser, Werner Dutschke and Edmund Collein. On the 6th of October, 1959 they lay the foundation stone for 4,674 apartments. However, this stone had a symbolic significance only: there was no longer any need for masons laying bricks one on top of the other. In the following six years, machines used the large-panel building system to assemble industrially manufactured concrete slabs into prefabricated tower blocks.
It was not only the technology that changed. Unlike the first construction phase on the former Stalinallee in Friedrichshain, the buildings in the district of Mitte were not constructed as block-edge developments. The tower blocks made from prefabricated concrete slabs are free-standing, broken up by numerous green areas.
Outsourced entertainment
When you walk along Karl-Marx-Allee, take a closer look at the area between where Berolinastraße and Schillingstraße meet the avenue. One of the most notable buildings of this construction phase is located here – Kino International, which has a spacious lounge on the first floor.
At this spot you will notice other pavilions with large panes of glass and narrow aluminium frames. At the time, architects aspired for a strict separation of residential and functional buildings. In contrast to the residential palaces, the prefab tower blocks did not house any businesses or shops. Instead, a cultural and commercial centre, consisting of a restaurant, hotel and other businesses, were concentrated in the area around the Schillingstraße underground station.
The Soviet speciality restaurant Café Moskau and the Mokka-Milch-Eisbar youth club were among the attractions. These functional buildings have new uses today, whereas the former Hotel Berolina no longer exists.",,,Grand Tour of Berlin Modernism,https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/styles/visitberlin_bleed_header_visitberlin_mobile_1x/private/image/Karl_Marx_Allee_Bauabschnitt2_28_BIT_0472_c_LDA_Foto_Wolfgang_Bittner_DL_PPT_0.jpg?h=2f83cd36&itok=KC9x3zjR,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/karl-marx-allee,,,,

But in winter 2015 and spring of 2016, trainee landscape  gardeners from Lichtenberg and Fried­richshain worked under supervision and restored the park completely:  flower bed borders, fresh soil, newly planted roses and shrubs, as well as spring flowers have restored the beauty of this park.
The rose garden is located on open space between the magnificent 1950s buildings which were built in part to  resemble Soviet architecture and in part to resemble the Neo-classicism inspired by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. This monumental boulevard was to demonstrate Socialist superiority; spacious, light-filled ensembles rather than the earlier tenement buildings of the working classes. In the early days, the apartments on Stalinallee, as it was called  at the time, were given as a reward to deserving workers.
The occupant lists show that workers, teachers, police officers and even architects and officials moved in here. This urban planning concept did not focus exclusively on aspects of comfort, such as heating, hot water and lifts, it also included green areas along the impressive facades.
If you take a walk along the double- width footpaths of Karl-Marx-Allee, past the wedding-cake style buildings, strolling quite a distance under trees, you will arrive at the rose garden close to Weberwiese underground station. A wall made of rubble, like the ones built in the early 1950s, and an information panel inform the historically aware that the uprising of 17 June 1953 began at this rose garden, when workers at the huge construction site laid down their tools and went on strike. ",,,,https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/styles/visitberlin_bleed_header_visitberlin_mobile_1x/private/image/Karl-Marx-Allee__MG_3424_c_G%C3%BCnter%20Steffen_DL_PPT_0.jpg?h=dc0d2132&itok=vKrO4vgZ,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/rosengarten-karl-marx-allee,,,,

Enjoy viewing more than 8,000 artistic objects, mainly from German culture. At the museum, you’ll learn how some of the sculptures were created and acquired. In the picturesque building, you can see its particularly impressive collection of ancient construction and kiln ceramics. Interested visitors may also attend the museum’s regular special exhibitions and lectures.

From historicism to functionalism: Ceramics in changing times
In 1990, gallery owner and ceramics expert Heinz-Joachim Theis founds the museum, which displays a collection of carefully curated ceramic objects. In 2004, the museum refurbishes and relocates to the building it currently calls home. The museum structure, built in 1712 according to plans of Royal Court architect Eosander von Göthe and restored by the city of Berlin in the 1980s, is located in Charlottenburg's old town. Theis runs the museum with the assistance of a support association and voluntary helpers. Visiting the Ceramics Museum will stir feelings of nostalgia, leaving visitors with the impression that the inhabitants of the historical townhouse are still there.
On closer inspection, however, the picturesque structure presents itself in a very contemporary way. Enter the prestigious rooms and view precious objects from two centuries. The mixture between an old-fashioned living space and a prestigious modern public space is striking. Creaking floorboards and neo-classical wall decorations surround you with history, and at the same time, you can see the museum’s wide range of exhibits behind glass display cabinets in bright, modern rooms. Exciting contemporary and exotic ceramic art is also on display. The courtyard is well worth a visit: the enchanted garden invites you to dream and enjoy a picnic in the idyllic atmosphere.

But the fact that over 4,000 hectares within the city limits belong to a nature park is truly something special. Other well-known nature parks in Germany include the Bayerischer Wald, the Erzgebirge, and the Teutoburger Wald parks.
The ""Berliner"" Among the Natural Parks
Berlin’s nature park begins behind Schönhausen Palace in the district of Pankow and extends to the northwest to the picturesque Lübars neighbourhood. It spans approximately 750 square kilometres, almost as extensive as Berlin itself, stretching north of the city limits between Bernau, Bad Freienwalde, Eberswalde, and Oranienburg. Because of its location, the park enjoys access to several stations on Berlin’s S-Bahn lines, as well as almost 50 stations on the regional Deutsche Bahn network, making it possible to reach this green oasis by public transport in just 30 minutes
A popular Destination of the Berliners
Chiefly thanks to its many clear lakes and romantic brooks, Naturpark Barnim has been a popular destination for getaways or hiking excursions since the 19th century. For over 100 years, the Heidekrautbahn has also brought guests directly from Berlin to their destinations in the heart of the park. On some of the lakes, locals still catch vendace, a fish considered a local delicacy. You can also observe the birds and the animals that make their home in the park, trek through the flowering heathlands, explore the mysterious moors, or savour the fresh forest air provided by the native pine, beech, oak, and alder trees. Remains of Slavic and German castles are scattered throughout the richly varied landscape. Impressive stone and brick buildings bear witness to ancient craftsmanship and historic waterways such as the Finow Canal reflect the turbulent history of the local economy. Germany is home to more than 100 nature parks, which together cover one-fourth of the whole country.
Popular destinations in Naturpark Barnim:
The old Hobrechtsfelde estate with its historic granary, water tower, barn, school, commons, housing for the estate workers, and barracks for seasonal harvesters. The estate was also once home to a slaughterhouse and a sawmill. It also happens to be home to Berlin’s leach fields, where 37 million cubic metres of waste water are treated each year.
The romantically wild Briese Valley with its alder fens. In days past, peat was harvested here and the power of the small Briese river was once tamed by water mills. Today, the headwaters of the Briese in their natural, wild state are a popular destination taking hikers down to Wandlitzsee.
The Wandlitzsee and Liepnitzsee are closely intertwined with recent history, because this is where the ruling class in Communist East Germany had their dachas hidden deep in the forest along Wandlitzsee. And the Liepnitzsee used to be strictly off-limits, guarded by armed soldiers protecting East German leader Erich Honecker’s vacation home. Today, a ferry named ""Frieda"" carries visitors to the Insulaner Klause outdoor pub on the beautiful island in the lake.
If you’re up for it, you can head north of the nature park directly into the Schorfheide-Chorin biosphere reserve, home to hundreds of square kilometres of forest, some of which have even been named UNESCO World Heritage sites.
Popular destinations here include:
the Niederfinow lift lock, which began operation in 1934 It is the oldest operating lift lock in Germany, bridging a height difference of 36 metres

The expressionist industrial construction evolved into an exciting encounter between everyday culture and the art scene. With large production halls and a huge exhibition space, the present KINDL – Centre for Contemporary Art is ideal for large installations. The rugged, breathtakingly primitive and futuristic-looking rooms showcase modern paintings and performances in the perfect space.
Spectacular installations in Sud - and Kesselhaus
At the end of the 1920s, the Kindl brewery rises from the spirit of expressionism. During this time, it serves as a world-class, cutting-edge production facility. After its closure in 2005, the grade II listed building stands empty for years. In 2011, a two German art aficionados set about the ambitious task of developing it into the current art centre and cultural meeting place. The fully renovated complex finally opens in October 2016. At first glance, the huge industrial monument leaves a lasting impression: a glance upwards reveals the size of the mighty tower. At its feet, the impressive entrance looks like the modern portal to a Gothic house of God. Located next to the tower, the high windows of the boiler house reach almost to the ceiling. With a height of 20 metres, the building offers an extraordinary space for large installations, such as Roman Signer's suspended sports aircraft, part of an exhibition on display here between September 2014 and June 2015. Spectacular exhibitions like 
Kitfox Experimental take place here. Several rooms in the powerhouse host a wide variety of events. Bright tiled walls create an inspiring atmosphere for video installations, talks with artists, concerts and readings. On the ceiling, massive support structures remain, giving the place a solid, dramatic mood. The Kesselhaus is no less impressive: the six giant receptacles echo Metropolis and steampunk culture. In this bizarre ambiance, the so-called Kafenion King Otto serves drinks and snacks. Under the Kesselhaus, a small, alternative brewery manufactures barley juice and continues to produce highly rated craft beer. Enjoy one in the beer garden directly front of the building.

Our tips for your visit
Take the Underground line U8 to Boddinstraße, or the U7 to Rathaus Neukölln. From here, its just ten minutes on foot to the KINDL – Centre for Contemporary Art.

The Kindl-Brauerei is closed Monday and Tuesday.
Art in Berlin Neukölln: local and close to the people
Art and culture are writ large in Neukölln. Everywhere you come across galleries, theatres and exhibitions. Art events and creative work are typical of the area known as the Schillerkiez. Young families and trend-setters have discovered the neighbourhood and you can eat well in the cafés and burger joints.
Near the KINDL – Centre for Contemporary Art is Galerie im Körnerpark. In the long corridors of this Neo-Baroque orange building, you'll see mostly painting and photographic art. The large windows provide plenty of natural light. In the summer, the gallery organises outdoor concerts. Also nearby is 
Galerie im Saalbau on Karl-Marx-Straße in Berlin-Neukölln. The gallery sees itself as down-to-earth and connected to the district. Many art professionals in Berlin can be found here. Curators place much emphasis on socio-critical topics. As at the Galerie im Körnerpark, the exhibitions here change regularly.

Berlin",52.5207015,13.4229964,Architecture,2,FALSE,Kino International,"Reopens on July 2. - Panoramic front and a seemingly floating projection hall: with Kino International, GDR architecture succeeded in plugging into Modernism.",,,"The first industrially manufactured residential buildings using the prefabricated construction method were built from 1959 to 1965 between Strausberger Platz and Alexanderplatz. The GDR thus broke away from the confectioner style of the Stalin era, whose buildings still characterise Karl-Marx-Allee to this day.

Yet the socialist housing complex on Karl-Marx-Allee in Mitte was intended to be more than just a place to live. From 1961 to 1964 it obtained its own urban centre: additional buildings for culture and conviviality, such as the Café Moskau, the Mokka-Milch-Eisbar and Kino International.

The design for these additional buildings was drawn up by the architect Josef Kaiser. As former head planner of the 'Stalinstadt' Eisenhüttenstadt, Kaiser oriented himself by the confectioner style at the beginning of the 1950s. He subsequently tried to catch up with developments in the West. The similarity of Kino International with the latest event buildings from West Berlin at the time – Zoo Palast and Deutsche Oper – was unmistakable. 

An open house
The first floor of the cinema is a particular eye-catcher. It rises for nine metres over the façade of the ground floor without columns – and as such appears to float. The cinema hall is also to be found on the first floor. For an audience of originally 600, it boasted state-of-the-art equipment at the time of opening: for example, a wide screen in cinemascope format and acoustics perfectly adapted to the room.

The façade of the upper floor is covered with a huge window front – interrupted only by the current film poster, which is still hand-painted to this day. With the glass façade, Kaiser wanted to underline the importance of the cinema as an open house for all residents and visitors. Everyone should feel welcome – the building had more to offer than a cinema. In GDR times, the youth club Klub International organised concerts with new bands. The district library was also housed in the premises.

Utopia and reality
If you have the opportunity to visit Kino International, don't just look at the front façade with the panoramic window. Walk around the building once. You will notice that the other three sides have no windows at all. They consist of a relief by the artists Waldemar Grzimek, Karl-Heinz Schamal and Hubert Schiefelbein. Their 14 concrete casting plates bear the title Aus dem Leben heutiger Menschen (From the lives of today's people), but in truth show a utopian vision of the future: an engineer who controls futuristic machines. A manual labourer whose physical strength is no longer needed and who is therefore studying a book.

The contradiction between utopia and practice was not only visible in the façade. If the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) regime found films to be too critical, it terminated them prematurely. Nevertheless, those in power at the time were also aware of the reality to some extent: Kino International had to show Western productions in order to finance itself. This led to an exciting programme mixture. At Kino International, award-winning GDR productions such as Solo Sunny were premiered, as were selected films from the West such as Cabaret and Dirty Dancing.

The GDR collapsed in 1989/90, but Kino International remained. In 1992 the Yorck Group acquired the building, which it has been operating ever since. Here, European and independent productions were shown, even in their original versions. The listed building was also the venue of the Berlinale. Whether it be Robert Redford, Steven Spielberg, Tilda Swinton or Wim Wenders – the greats of the international film scene have all been guests here in the past.

Our tips for nearby Kino International
You should not miss out on a visit to Kino International. Before watching a film, spend time relaxing in the panorama bar with its excellent view of Karl-Marx-Allee thanks to the glass façade. Kino International is not only a cinema, but also an event location. In the place where the GDR state leadership used to retire to after film premieres, events are taking place today, for example on New Year's Eve. Within walking distance you can discover other modern Berlin buildings from GDR times: take a look at Josef Kaiser's Café Moskau, the Mokka-Milch-Eisbar and the confectioner buildings of the former Stalinallee [internal links] east of Strausberger Platz.

An audio guide helps you relive the drama.,,,"In late autumn 1811, the German dramatist, lyricist and author Heinrich von Kleist took a walk with his good friend Henriette Vogel to a hill at the edge of the forest by the lake called Kleiner Wannsee. They sat down at a garden table and politely drank coffee, wine and rum. At around 4 in the afternoon, the poet took two pistols out of a picnic basket and first shot his companion and then himself. A dramatic exit in the most literal sense.  
Money worries and a lack of appreciation for his works had driven Kleist to desperation and thoughts of suicide. Henriette Vogel had terminal cancer and decided that they should die together. Heinrich von Kleist and Henriette Vogel were buried together a few days later at the place where they died. You can still visit the grave today.
The grave of Heinrich von Kleist and Henriette Vogel
When you make your way along Bismarckstraße towards the grave, you first pass a number of villas and the venerable clubhouses of Berlin’s oldest rowing clubs. Between houses number two and four, a narrow path leads down to the Kleiner Wannsee. There, among a thicket of maple and oak trees, is a clearing with the simple grave. Its original inscription (“He lived, sang and suffered / in gloomy and difficult times, / he sought death here, / and found immortality” - Matthew 6:12) was removed by the Nazis, who replaced it with “Now, immortality, you belong to me.“
As part of the Kleist commemorations in 2011, the grave was renovated and new information panels were put up. As well as this, Henriette Vogel’s details were carved into the gravestone and the old inscription was restored.
An audio memorial to Kleist
If you want to find out more about what happened on 21 November 1811 at the Kleiner Wannsee, you will find an audio memorial to Kleist there. In his audio drama, the director Paul Plamper asks what happened that day and how much we know of it today.

From 1821-1918 a family museum is located in the main floor. After that, the entire building becomes a tenement house again, before becoming a venue space in 1989. Since then, it offers a vivid insight into style, culture and history of the Biedermeier years between 1815 and 1848. Enter via a narrow spiral staircase to the first floor, dedicated to the family. The rooms are authentically furnished, as if the family have only just left the house. In the living room are everyday objects and furniture belonging to Henriette Knoblauch, wife of Carl Knoblauch. The furniture of a lady, that is: the writing desk and dressing table, display the functional side of the Biedermeier period. The library tells of long-time house master Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Knoblauch, and his achievements in politics. Carl's brother, Eduard Knoblauch, is a famous architect and student of Karl Schinkel. An original bookcase belonging to him is located in the entrance room. The decoration of the house is typical of this time: very simple and modest. A chandelier designed by Schinkel also reflects discretion: its golden splendour is made from inexpensive substitutes. Also, note the green flowers in the window. Although now so commonplace, this style originated here. On the second floor, you pass through the smaller rooms belonging to the Knoblauch family, learning about the social life, architecture and politics of Berlin through objects, pictures and official documents.

Next to the Knoblauchhaus, behold the Nikolai Church and its distinctive twin towers. It has been the centre of the historic Nikolai quarter for 800 years. It now serves as museum of the church building and Berlin's history. Its publicly accessible basement is considered the oldest area of the city. Only a few metres from the Knoblauchhaus - close to the famous Museumsinsel (Museum Island) - is the imposing Ephraim-Palais, showcasing temporary exhibitions of Berlin's artistic and cultural history.

Berlin",52.4452589,13.5749378,Museum,2,TRUE,Rathaus Köpenick,The story of the phoney captain of Köpenick is famous. See for yourself the scene of the masquerade – Rathaus Köpenick,,,"It was a shoemaker who made Köpenick’s town hall famous. The exhibitions there tell the story of the famous incident in the 20th century and the history of the administrative building. The imposing town hall is in the Treptow-Köpenick borough in the far south-east of Berlin. Even today, it’s still a popular subject for photographs.

The construction of Rathaus Köpenick
The town hall was built in the Brick Gothic style by Hugo Kinzer and Hans Schütte, starting in 1901. The new building was supposed to cost 350,000 marks, but in fact it ran to around 632,000 marks, proving that badly underestimated costs are not just a modern phenomenon. In 1905, Köpenick’s prestige building, with its 54-metre-high tower, was officially opened. Köpenick was not incorporated into Berlin until 1920. The magnificent staircase and the large heraldic room in the Rathaus make it one of Berlin’s most attractive town hall buildings.

The phoney Captain of Köpenick
In 1906, the Rathaus was the scene of a confidence trick that has since become legendary. The main figure was an unemployed cobbler called Wilhelm Voigt, while the best known member of the supporting cast was the Mayor of Köpenick, Dr. Georg Langerhans. The 57-year-old cobbler played a very special trick to lighten the town coffers. To do it, he went to a flea market and spent the last of his money on a captain’s uniform. In October, he tricked some soldiers into believing he was a real captain and set off to the town hall, where he promptly arrested the mayor and had him sent to the Neue Wache guardhouse in Berlin. He then demanded 3,557 marks from the city coffers in return for a receipt. he was finally caught and sentenced 10 days later.

The hoax went down in history, and was the inspiration for Carl Zuckermeyer’s comedy The Captain of Köpenick. Theatre and film adaptations made the whole world laugh and the town hall famous. A bronze statue and a plaque on town hall recall the caper today.

Exhibitions and events in the Rathaus Köpenick
In the town hall itself you can see the exhibition The Captain of Köpenick with exhibits including Voigt’s uniform and the legendary safe where the town coffers were kept. Another exhibition covers the history and architecture of the Neo-Gothic building.

You can also be the Captain’s guest and see the musical Der Hauptmann von Köpenick where it really happened. The story is re-enacted here several times a week.",,,"Architecture

",,,"Schloss Köpenick is idyllically situated on an island in the river. Locals call the Baroque building the Wasserschloss (Water Palace) and it is the only Baroque building in Berlin to survive in its original state.
Early history
In the 8th century, long before the Hohenzollerns and Kings of Prussia, Slavs built a castle on the island where the palace now stands. The Ascanians conquered the area and the castle after driving out the Slavs in the mid-13th century. The next significant event in the prehistory of the palace happened in 1558, when Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg built a Renaissance-style hunting lodge on the island.
From a Renaissance castle to a Baroque palace
Friedrich – the third son of the Great Elector, Friedrich Wilhelm – was granted the estate in Köpenick to build a palace. The Renaissance castle was completely demolished and replaced with a three-storey Baroque building. Rutger van Langervelt and Johann Arnold Nering were the architects who designed it. Work on the palace continued until 1690. The Italian Giovanni Caroveri embellished the Water Palace with the finest stuccoes to be found north of the Alps. The prince – later crowned King Friedrich I of Prussia – only lived in the palace for a short time together with his wife Elisabeth Henriette. She died young, but it was she who initiated the building on the island of the Margraviate of Brandenburg’s first Protestant palace church, where concerts are now often held.
The court case
Once the prince inherited the title of Elector, the palace in Köpenick was only used as a summer residence, and when Friedrich remarried, it lost even that status: Charlottenburg became the new summer residence. However, the location in Köpenick was an attractive one for hunting, which means that the Baroque castle was once again a hunting lodge.
Things heated up at the palace in 1730, when the Prussian court-martial met in its heraldic room. The young crown prince Friedrich – later known as Frederick the Great – was accused of desertion. A traitor to his own land? This was intolerable to his father Friedrich Wilhelm I, who was known as the Soldier King. The crown prince was found guilty and sent to prison in Küstrin.
The Kunstgewerbemuseum
The branch of Berlin’s Kunstgewerbemuseum that is housed in Schloss Köpenick is a museum of interior design, with ornaments, silverware and furniture in the Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo styles all on show. There are 21 rooms, showing how the bourgeois and the nobility lived in those times. The highlight is the restored heraldic room.","Opening hours

Berlin",52.4717028,13.4380648,Park,2,FALSE,Körnerpark,Körnerpark is one of the most beautiful green spaces in Berlin.,,,"In 1916, entrepreneur Franz Körner made the city of Berlin an offer it could not refuse. He had a gravel pit located at the junction of Jonasstraße, Schierkerstraße, Wittmannsdorfer Straße and Selkestraße. Körner wanted to bequeath it to the city, on the condition that a park would be created there that bears his name. The concept proposed by Neukölln Horticulture Director Hans Richard Küllenberg merged architectural and horticultural design to create a monumental edifice in a way typical of the turn of the last century. The idyllic garden area has experienced ups and downs in the course of its hundred years. It was once lauded by the media as “Neukölln’s Sanssouci” and “Berlin’s most beautiful gravel pit”, while other reviled it as “Neukölln’s Misery”. After the Second World War, the park fell more and more into a state of disrepair. It was not until 1977 when its reconstruction began as one of the largest construction projects in the district at the time.

The Körnerpark today
Today, long stairs lead with balustrades down to the lawns which are between five and seven metres (16-23 feet) below street level. Water splashes down six levels before a fountain takes it up and spits it back up into the air. Small canals, trimmed hedges, a colourful flower garden, and plane trees make Körnerpark one of the most beautiful green spaces in all of Berlin. Since 1983, the former greenhouse has been home to the municipal Galerie im Körnerpark and a café. The opening exhibition presented drawings by Markus Lüpertz, who was working at the time in the former studio in a side wing on art in public buildings. For more than 30 years, the Galerie im Körnerpark has been a key cultural centre for Neukölln and presents nationally and internationally renowned contemporary artists. The free outdoor summer concert series and the indoor Salonmusik series in spring and autumn bring music to park year-round.

But in 1914, the  tower was shut down as its capacity was not enough to supply the growing city. Up to 1952, the water tower served as a surge tank and pressure gauge.

The facilities on the premises of the  waterworks were used for very diffe­- rent and unfortunately rather unpleasant purposes. From 1922 to 1930,  a soup kitchen for the poor in Berlin was housed in the engine house. The former underground water reservoir was used for some time as a store and for fish processing. In 1931, the waterworks handed the property over to Prenzlauer Berg. In 1933, at the behest of Hermann Göring, the SA misused the engine houses and water reservoirs that had been used as storage rooms to set up one of their first »wild concentration camps«.

Today, the tower is a residential building. Since 1994, the non-profit organisation »Förderband« has been using the water tank for public art events. Vis- it­ors are fascinated by the acoustics of the tank. The echo in the big tank lasts 18 seconds and four to five in the small tank. You should remember to wear warm clothes as it can be quite cold.

Steep steps will take you up to a park on higher ground. The slope of this park that was restored in 2007 has been planted with roses. If you take a picnic basket, you can sit back, relax and enjoy watching the laid-back goings on in the many street cafés and bars around Wasserturmplatz.

Berlin",52.5005669,13.3133503,Attractions,1,FALSE,Kurfürstendamm,No trip to Berlin is complete without a stroll down Kurfürstendamm. Berlin’s most popular shopping boulevard is the beating heart of the western city centre.,,,"Kurfürstendamm got its name from the prince-electors who rode along it to hunt in Grunewald, but now it’s full of Berliners and visitors on the hunt for the latest fashion and designer items or the best bargains. And that’s how Kurfürstendamm became Ku’damm.

Kurfürstendamm is Berlin’s most famous and popular shopping boulevard and is the heart of the western city centre. You’re sure to enjoy a successful shopping trip there. The 3.5-kilometre-long boulevard takes you from Breitscheidplatz and the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche to Rathenauplatz, where the Grunewald villas begin.

Breitscheidplatz is where Kurfürstendamm officially begins; before that the street is called Tauentzienstraße. This runs into Wittenbergplatz, where you will find the legendary KaDeWe – Berlin’s most famous department store, which everyone associates with Kurfürstendamm, even though, technically, it isn’t on it.

Kurfürstendamm today: shopping for everyone

The boulevard begins at bustling Breitscheidplatz. The Europa-Center on the Tauentzienstraße side is Berlin’s oldest shopping centre. The high-rise building topped with a giant Mercedes emblem houses around 70 shops and the Stachelschweine cabaret theatre.

Along Kurfürstendamm you pass the flagship stores of famous labels, shops of international brands and famous names, and Karstadt, another big department store. Towards Halensee from Olivaer Platz onwards, it’s less busy, and the window displays become more elegant and the shops even more exclusive. This is where you will find the boutiques of the top designers and international brands. A magnificent restoration job has been carried out on Haus Cumberland, a splendid building from the early 20th century.

Attractions on Kurfürstendamm

The most striking landmark on Kurfürstendamm is the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche on Breitscheidplatz. Behind it, an elegant new quarter has developed with the modernised Bikinihaus, the Zoo Palast cinema and the high-rise Waldorf Astoria, all of which have contributed to the revival of the western city centre.

The Ku’damm-Eck on the corner of Joachimsthaler Straße is an interesting example of contemporary architecture. At the Kranzler-Eck opposite, until it was modernised in 2000, the chairs of Café Kranzler stood outside on the pavement. Today, the red and white striped awning still decorates the rotunda of the Neues Kranzler-Eck. A few steps further on, the Schaubühne am Lehniner Platz regularly makes theatrical history with its gripping productions.

For Berlin’s 750th anniversary celebrations, sculptures were installed all along Ku’Damm. The intertwining sculpture Berlin on Tauentzienstraße – a famous motif from the soap opera Gute Zeiten, Schlechte Zeiten – is still a popular subject for photographs. The “Concrete Cadillacs” at Rathenauplatz are the most controversial works of art in West Berlin.

From a bridle path to a shopping boulevard

Around 1542, Elector Joachim II had a log road built from his palace in Berlin to his hunting lodge in Grunewald. The oldest document showing the existence of the unnamed bridle path was the “Plan géométral de Berlin et des environs” made in 1685 by the engineer La Vigne. Not until 1886, once the road was fully paved, could it develop into a boulevard. Its founding date is generally considered to be 5 May 1886 – the day the steam tram service from Zoologischer Garten to Halensee started.

In the 1920s, Kurfürstendamm was the centre of the new west of the city. Poets, journalists and intellectuals met at the Romanisches Café (where the Europa-Center now stands) and the Café des Westens (later known as Café Kranzler). When the city was divided, Kurfürstendamm became the heart of West Berlin and the shop window of the western world with all the latest fashions. Hildegard Knef sang of her longing for it in her hit “Heimweh nach dem Kurfürstendamm”. In those days, Berliners and tourists sat outside the famous Kranzler and Möhring cafés, wandered through the shops and department stores and danced through the night in the discos.  

After reunification, Kurfürstendamm and the area around it became quieter in the evenings when the nightlife moved to the new clubs opening in the east of the city. Many established cafés and restaurants closed. Where there used to be more than 20 cinemas, only two are left: the Cinema Paris in the Centre Français and the Astor Filmlounge. But the recent revival in the City West with the new Zoo Palast and the Bikinihaus has also benefited Kurfürstendamm, which has become an increasingly elegant shopping boulevard.

Around Kurfürstendamm

It’s worth checking out the side streets between Fasanenstraße and Schlüterstraße with their Parisian flair, lined by magnificent old buildings. Fasanenstraße, Bleibtreustraße and Knesebeckstraße are full of stylish boutiques, bookshops, designer shops and cosy cafés. A walk along Uhlandstraße to Kantstraße takes you to a designer shopping area with the stilwerk design centre and many other shops selling art and furniture. The attractive Savignyplatz, with its many cafés and restaurants, is not far from here either.

Tip:

Look out for the house numbers on Kurfürstendamm. You won’t find numbers 1 to 10, because they no longer exist. They were reassigned to Budapester Straße in the 1920s.

The permanent exhibition goes on to show the intentions of the GDR regime and the actual lives of people at the time. 800 exhibits and 200 documents, films and sound recordings by contemporary witnesses let you penetrate deeply into the reality of the GDR.
Shortage economy and private happiness
In 1991, the Kulturbrauerei is established at the old Schultheiss brewery on Knaackstraße. The 20 renovated buildings house cinemas, theatres and clubs. In 2005, the Foundation Haus der Geschichte acquires this extensive collection of industrial design and everyday culture from the GDR. Having selected the former brewery as a venue, the opening exhibition 'Everyday life in the GDR' is held on an area of 600 m² in late 2012. Visitors learn about the earliest known ideology of the SED State via large propaganda posters and short texts. The influence of the Soviet Union is obvious in the SED's promotion of jobs and leisure activities. Hear recordings of songs which the collective praised, and look at workers' ledgers: a colourful mixture of political slogans and impressions from meetings, such as football matches. The Museum focuses on the lack of everything - the lack of adequate living space, electronic appliances, fruit and vegetables. A contemporary witness complains about the long wait for a shelving unit and a cassette recorder, and another about a Christmas without oranges. Take a look at a typically furnished flat in a prefabricated building. The style of the textiles is also part of the exhibition. Many East Germans find their happiness in private. Marvel at the ingenuity of humans: the roof tent on the 'Trabi' car that sufficed for a holiday in Rugen or Usedom, and the imaginatively constructed holiday homes in the country. Temporary exhibitions on topics such as design in East Germany complement the permanent exhibition.

Berlin",52.4669474,13.36592,Gallery,2,FALSE,District,District Berlin is an interdisciplinary project space for artistic and social experiments at the intersection of visual arts and other forms of knowledge production.,,,"With a focus on urban space District realizes a versatile program of art projects including research and performative practices in public spaces, exhibitions, performances, discourse and workshop formats as well as publications. Taking its outer location at Tempelhof-Schöneberg area as conceptual premise, District engages in perspectives which are currently at the margins of political and cultural (self-)representation and provides a platform for the investigation of tactics of enunciation and infiltration. In this sense, District performs as trans-cultural harbourage, paradoxical rehearsal stage and mutable archive of contemporary artistic-intellectual practices.

Far from the centre of contemporary art in Berlin-Mitte, the gallery has also succeeded – with constantly developing its programme in the last five years – in attracting the regular art audience from all over Berlin. The gallery is run by the Kunstverein Tiergarten, which has been founded in 2005, and which – with its growing number of committed members – also organises cultural festivals for the district and other events outside the gallery.

In the following years, the art lovers concentrated on collecting paintings.

Among the highlights are works by Jonathan Monk, Christopher Williams, Heimo Zobernig, Haegue Yang, Martin Boyce, Carol Bove, and Wade Guyton, as well as an increasing number of pieces by first-generation conceptual artists, including Stanley Brouwn, Ian Wilson, and Morgan Fisher.

Plus a café with beer garden for a refreshing drink before or after the show.",,,"Cultural diversity is the agenda at Schwartzsche Villa and the programme is correspondingly broad with exhibitions of contemporary art, concerts with classic music, and children's theatre, all on offer in this stately building in Steglitz.

The villa is listed and houses a café on its south-west corner which offers snacks and a large beer garden: the perfect spot to enjoy some sun, relax, and get away from the hustle and bustle of the city.

From summer residence to cultural centre: the story of the Schwartzsche Villa

Carl Schwartz built the villa in 1895 as a summer residence for his family. The house was modified in 1915 to allow various members of the family to stay there year-round. At the end of World War II the last inhabitant of the house died and it was abandoned. It initially served as an orphanage and was later used as a warehouse. The city of West Berlin bought the property in 1961, but it was only twenty years later that it was turned into a cultural centre by Kulturinitiative Lankwitz.

It took another eleven years before the cornerstone was laid for the conversion, but finally the Schwartzsche Villa opened as a cultural centre in 1992, run by the Steglitz-Zehlendorf district government. 

How is the Schwartzsche Villa used today?

The Schwartzsche Villa brings together many institutions and uses into a single facility:


	a studio in the attic
	a gallery and studio theatre upstairs
	a large and small salon with a grand piano on the ground floor
	the fireplace room, also on the ground floor, which serves as a meeting room
	an etching workshop, a photo lab, and a rehearsal stage in the basement


Regular special exhibitions complete the offer.

The studio theatre at Schwartzsche Villa

The cultural office of the Steglitz-Zehlendorf district operates the villa's small studio theatre. Concerts, primarily classical, readings, and theatre for children and adults take place here.","Tuesday

It is originally intended to house sculptures for Hitler's Germania project. Sculptor Bernhard Heiliger moves in here after the war, followed by other artists. You can see Heiliger's sculptures in the sculpture garden attched to the museum. The studio is an exhibition space for post-war art of the East and West.
From NS-atelier to postwar modern art museum
Arno Breker comes to prominence in Nazi Germany when Adolf Hitler admires his sculptures. Breker, working with Albert Speer, accompanies Hitler to Paris and builds monumental sculptures that he hopes would adorn Berlin in the future. He is given his own studio which is now Kunsthaus Dahlem. After the war, it's occupied by the Americans and, shortly thereafter, Berlin's sculptors once more. The first such artist, Bernhard Heiliger, moves there in 1949 and stays for 46 years creating almost the entirety of the Sculpture Garden behind the house. The studios are also a haven for other artists such as Emilio Vedova and Wolf Vostell. By 2013, Kunsthaus Dahlem has become a workplace for artists from all over the world – sometimes housing those with scholarships from the DAAD.
Today, the studios are closed – opened in 2015 as an exhibition venue for post-war modernism. You can see sculptures, paintings and photography. Managed by the Bernhard Heiliger Foundation, exhibitions focus on the years between 1945 and 1961. A considerable renovation has been implemented by Berlin's former mayor, Klaus Wowereit. You will first catch sight of the high brick facade of the building, surrounded by the green fringes of Grunewald forest. The main studio is approximately 300 square metres in size. There are high windows – nine metres from the floor to ceiling – letting in plenty of light. Just as high are the wooden doors in the monumental style of the NS architects. In the middle of the room, you are led up a spiral staircase to the gallery. On the white limestone walls are photographs or paintings, depending on the exhibition. Sculptures form the focal point. Kunsthaus Dahlem always exhibits major shows for longer periods. In addition, four times a year there is a new temporary exhibition.

Spread across four floors, you will find regularly rotating exhibitions within the converted rooms. As a space for progressive and innovative artistic practice, the gallery champions pieces with political and social themes. Additionally, the KW Institute was responsible for the launch of the Berlin Biennale, one of the capital's foremost art festivals since 1998.
From margarine factory to meeting place for contemporary art
In the early '90s, Klaus Biesenbach, now director of the New York MoMa PS1, rents the building of the former margarine factory. Together with a young and artistically minded group, he rapidly develops the KW Institute into a permanent feature of the Berlin art scene. Through its involvement with the Berlin Biennale, Biesenbach brings worldwide recognition to the institute. In order to be as flexible and open as possible, the KW Institute for Contemporary Art consciously rejects the concept of a permanent collection. In this way, current trends within the international art scene can be easily integrated into the rotating exhibitions. The gallery experiments with new formats, ideas and content, positioning itself as a laboratory designed to explore the space between artist and audience. Here, many outstanding artists have presented their work, including Harun Farocki, Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Matthew Barney. The building itself centres around a main square in which Dan Graham's stylish glass and steel Cafe Bravo stands. Behind the listed facade of the front building, the studios and exhibition rooms are spread throughout the converted space. In 2016, as part of wider renovations, a wooden spiral staircase, that connects the exhibition room on the first floor to the ground floor, was installed. Here, high vaulted ceilings featuring exposed arches can be found. Since the renovation, the institute has concentrated on open events for visitors, presenting a series of free performances, lectures and readings. Additionally, larger events are regularly organised in collaboration with partners such as Documenta in Kassel or the Venice Biennale. This exhibition space will undergo further renovation under fresh direction of Krist Gruijthuisen, extending the space by a further two floors.

The site in Hamburger Straße was once the resting place of many famous members of Berlin’s Jewish community. It is now the oldest recognisable cemetery in the inner city.
The beginnings
After large numbers of Jews were expelled from Vienna, Elector Friedrich Wilhelm issued an edict to take them in. In 1671, after an absence of more than a century, a Jewish community was re-established in Berlin, with more than 50 families moving in. The community was granted a burial place near Oranienburger Straße in the Rosenthal quarter which, at the time, was outside the city walls. Thousand of Jews are said to have been buried between 1672 and 1827 on the site covering only 5,900 square metres.
The most famous grave is probably that of the German philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, who was buried here in 1786. A gravestone, which has had to be restored several times, recalls the famous Enlightenment figure. To this day, Mendelssohn is considered the pioneer of the Haskalah, or Jewish Enlightenment. In 1763, his philosophical writings won the first prize of the Royal Academy in Berlin. Known to his followers as the German Socrates, Mendelssohn was a close friend of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing and is believed to be the inspiration for Nathan the Wise.
Other famous figures buried at the old Jewish cemetery include David Hirschel Fraenkel, Mendelsohn’s famous rabbi and teacher, Veitel Heine Ephraim, the court Jew of Frederick the Great who built the magnificent Ephraim Palace, Marcus Herz, the director of the Jewish hospital, and Jacob Herz Beer, the father of the composer and director Giacomo Meyerbeer.
After the closure
The cemetery was closed because of the Prussian hygiene ordinance of 1794, which prohibited burials at cemeteries in residential areas within the city walls. In 1827, a new Jewish cemetery was opened on Schönhauser Allee, but this was already too small by 1880, and so the Jewish cemetery in Weißensee was opened.
When the Jewish old people’s home was built and opened in 1844, the entrance of the former cemetery was moved to Hamburger Straße. Because Jewish religious law forbids the disturbance of the dead, the old cemetery was not built on, and it became a park used by the 120 residents of the old people’s home. It was an also a place where pupils of the nearby Jewish boys’ school could learn about natural history.
The Nazi period
Under the Nazis, the old people’s home was used from 1942 by the Gestapo as a holding camp for around 55,000 Jewish inhabitants of Berlin, and it was destroyed along with the cemetery in 1943. A zigzag trench was dug through the graveyard, the bones of the dead were pulled out of the ground and the gravestones were smashed. In April 1945, 2427 soldiers and civilians killed in street fighting were buried in mass graves at the cemetery.
After the war
In 1948 the cemetery was returned to the Jewish community. Part of the site was converted to a public park in the 1970s. On the site of the destroyed old people’s home, Willi Lammert’s sculpture “Jewish Victims of Fascism” was placed next to a memorial stone.
From 2007 to 2008, the site was altered again and tidied up so that the cemetery area could be seen again. A basin for ritual hand washing was put up by the entrance and panels provide information on the cemetery and the old people’s home.",,,Cemetaries,https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/styles/visitberlin_bleed_header_visitberlin_mobile_1x/private/image/KW09_4_Sophieneck_DL_PPT_2.jpg?h=de51b7fe&itok=2SxzUQ9g,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/alter-judischer-friedhof-old-jewish-cemetery,,,,

For more than 20 years, the harbour has housed historical ships, some well over 100 years old, such as the one built by Heinrich Zille in 1896. The collection is still growing, and discussions to expand towards the Osthafen have resulted in permission to use the old customs wharf. Here, a brand new exhibition on Berlin's ingenuous inland waterway transportation and the division of the country awaits.
The T-shaped customs and border bridge forms the basic framework of the Berliner Museumshafen. Although you can't enter, it is visible from every corner. About 17 ships will be part of the historic port - this includes the training ship Horst Günther. Visitors will also be treated to themed events and gastronomic offerings throughout the year.

St. Hedwig's Cathedral in the middle of Berlin - a church that has stood for religious tolerance throughout history. The Bishop's Church of the Archdiocese of Berlin adorns the Bebelplatz with its striking dome. The simple interior of the circular building is now being renovated and redesigned in order to be able to celebrate future church services according to the liturgical guidelines of the Second Vatican Council.

The first Catholic church building in Reformed Berlin
St. Hedwig's Cathedral is the first Catholic church after the Reformation in Protestant Berlin. The Prussian King Frederick the Great allowed the construction of the rotunda after the model of the Pantheon in order to provide a reference for the Catholic Silesians in Berlin. Friedrich also donated the building site on the Forum Friderizianum, the new representative square next to the opera house and library. Between 1747 and 1773, St. Hedwig was built by Johann Boumann the Elder according to plans by Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff.

The diocese of Berlin is founded in 1930. St. Hedwig becomes a bishop's church and its interior is redesigned in an expressionist style. After the destruction of the rotunda after an air raid in World War II, reconstruction begins in 1952. The interior is redesigned by the architect Hanns Schwippert.

Since 2010, the cathedral has been in increasing need of renovation. Today's liturgical celebration of the services according to the specifications of the Second Vatican Council is complicated by the wide floor opening with wide stairs in the centre of the cathedral. In November 2013, the Archdiocese of Berlin therefore launched a competition for a new spatial concept. Among the 169 designs received, the jury decided in favour of the proposal by Sichau & Walter Architekten GmbH/Fulda and Leo Zogmayer/Vienna. The new church will no longer have a wide circular floor opening, but the altar in the centre, around which the community will gather. An archaic but convincing thought.

Bernhard Lichtenberg has been provost of the cathedral since 1938. He opposes National Socialist terror, prays publicly for persecuted Jews and condemns the euthanasia program. After his arrest, he dies after two years in prison when he is transferred to a concentration camp. In 1996 Pope John Paul II beatified Bernhard Lichtenberg during his visit to Berlin. In 2004, the Yad Vashem memorial honoured him as a ""righteous among the nations"".

The Cathedral Forum: Open for visitors
The Bernhard-Lichtenberg-House is located right next to the church. Here is the Cathedralforum St. Hedwig, a meeting place for Berliners and their guests. Discussions and meditations, grief counseling and retreats as well as a permanent exhibition invite you to meet and get to know each other. The small bookshop offers Christian books and gifts and visitors can talk to the volunteers over a cup of coffee.
The Forum will remain open for the time being during the construction phase (Mon-Sat from 11-17.30) and will also provide information about the conversion.","Opening hours

In the context of the Berlin district Wedding, a former labourers district with a more than 75% migrant population, the concept and figure of the „Post-Other“ seems to be an omnipresent but unrealised concept and figure.

In the leafy western part of Berlin, right in the middle of Grunewald Forest is a tower 55 metres tall. Up on its viewing platform you have a glorious view of woods, fields and water – the ideal spot to take photos.
The tower is not just a delight for fans of Brick Gothic architecture. 36 metres above the ground there is a viewing platform. After climbing 204 steps you are rewarded a view of the Havel, Wannsee and 
Grunewald. If you prefer to have your feet on solid ground, you can admire August Oetken’s Neo-Byzantine mosaic on the ceiling of the memorial hall. The memorial hall on the ground floor contains a life-sized statue of Kaiser Wilhelm I. Alongside the statue at the foot of a tower, there is also a restaurant waiting for you.
Construction of the Grunewaldturm
In 1897, the council of the district of Teltow decided that a memorial should be built for the King of Prussia and Emperor of Germany Wilhelm I, who had died in 1888. The architect Franz Schwechten was commissioned to design the building on the hill known as Karlsberg. The reigning emperor Wilhelm II, the grandson of Wilhelm I, approved the design and construction began in 1897. The tower was opened just before the turn of the century on 9 June 1899.
About the name
In the original plans from Teltow, the new building was called the “König-Wilhelm-Turm”, and there is still an inscription on it today “in memory of the King”. However, after it was completed, the King’s grandson referred to it in his congratulatory telegram as the “Kaiser-Wilhelm-Turm”. After all, the German Empire had existed since 1871.
After the Second World War, the monument was renamed the Grunewaldturm, and is still called that today.
Our tip – a day trip to the Grunewald
Beautifully located by the river, the Grunewald forest is the perfect place for a long walk or a bicycle tour. And if you do that, you’ve got to see the tower. Other great ideas on a day trip to the Grunewald are a visit to the hunting lodge and a ferry trip to the island of Lindwerder.","Opening hours

The history of this park dates back almost 200 years. In 1823, Lieutenant-General Job von Witzleben, who was later to become Prussia’s War Minister, was rewarded 20,000 thalers by the King. He used this money to acquire a large piece of land around  Lietzensee lake where he commissioned Park Witzleben to be built as a summer residence for his wife and eight children. A short time after his death in 1837, the family sold the property. At the turn of the century, a property developer built prestigious residential buildings close to the water and opened Lietzensee and the park to the public. In 1910, the then city of Charlottenburg purchased the new park. It was expanded under an emergency programme.

The area is in fact a double lake and park. The south-west and north-east section of the park resemble the figure 8 which is pulled in tight at the centre by Neue Kantstraße, an embankment road dividing the lake in two. For many years now, the two halves of the lake have been connected by a canal and an underpass. Benedictine monks once fished in this sickle-shaped lake when it was still surrounded by woods. Nobody fishes in the lake anymore which is no deeper than four metres. Swimming is not permitted, except for swans, ducks and grebes.

Dernburgplatz forms the entrance to the quieter lake in the south of the park where there is not much happening. A pretty art-nouveau fountain gradually leads down to the lake. The lawn on  the south-east bank of the lake can be  quite lively in the summer time. The pathway leads us past maple, sycamore and willow trees, which look wonderful in autumn, under Neue Kantstraße and on to the more lively northern part of the lake. Suddenly,  we hear many different languages: English, Spanish, Turkish. Couples lie on the grass, joggers pass by, people sit on the nearby benches and enjoy the view over the water. There is a lot happening at the children’s playground and there’s exercise equipment on grassy patch.

At the end of the pathway, we arrive at »Bootshaus Stella« which tempts  visitors to indulge in cakes, pizza and Bavarian veal sausage on the sun  terrace. After that, you will quickly find yourself back in the hustle and bustle of Charlottenburg.

Take a walk along the former canal.,,,"Despite its name, Luisenstädtischer Kanal is not a waterway anymore. Instead, it's a place for nostalgic dreams where you can stroll through the wonderful gardens from Mitte to Kreuzberg.
A relict of past times
The Engelbecken (Angel’s Pool) is the only visible reminder of the historical Luisenstadt canal. Restored in 1999, the pool, with its numerous fountains, stretches out in front of St. Michael’s Church. Time flies by when you gaze at the glittering water on a peaceful afternoon. The man-made waterway between the river Spree and Urbanhafen took a detour from its straight route to meet the Engelbecken. Today, the drained canal bed is a park and gardens.
Construction of the Luisenstädtischer Kanal
In 1825, the idea was first mooted of building a waterway through Luisenstadt, at that time a suburb of Berlin. Fifteen years later, the King of Prussia commissioned the town planner Lenné to design a connection to reduce the traffic on the river Spree. The real reason for the construction project, however, was to occupy the city’s many unemployed. Work began on the 2-kilometre-long canal between the Landwehrkanal and the Spree in 1848. Four turbulent years later, the project was completed and the first ship passed through the new waterway, which led straight to St. Michael’s Church, and turned just before it into the Engelbecken.
The canal is filled in again
Due to the noise, the stink and the lack of shipping traffic, the decision was taken in 1926 to fill in the Luisenstädtischer Kanal, except for the Engelbecken, which survived as a central square. The landscape architect Erwin Barth argued for the canal to be kept, but the city government could not be persuaded, so he then developed ideas on how the park could be designed. One of his plans was to bring a romantic, Indian atmosphere to Berlin, but the church opposed this. The next draft included a park with a swimming pool, a playground and a small Indian garden. Here too, Barth was soon disappointed, because there was not enough money for it. A few of Barth’s ideas were finally implemented after 1926, and rebuilt in the 1990s after the destruction of the Second World War.
A stroll along the old canal
The best way to explore the garden is to take a walk. The route runs from the Schillingbrücke on the Spree and then along Engeldamm, Leuschnerdamm, Legiendamm and Erkelenzdamm to the Urbanhafen on the Landwehrkanal.",,,Hidden places in Berlin,https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/styles/visitberlin_bleed_header_visitberlin_mobile_1x/private/image/KW31-4-Engelbecken_DL_PPT_0.jpg?h=8a7fc05e&itok=zsyYzP3C,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/luisenstadtischer-kanal,,,,

In the midst of this now-vibrant cultural centre in Prenzlauer Berg, The Tchoban Foundation offers insight into the history of urban planning. The collection consists of architectural drawings from the 16th century up until today. Over four levels, the foundation presents works by big names such as Mies van der Rohe and Charles Friedrich Schinkel. The building is an exhibit in itself: from the outside see coloured concrete, windowless sandstone cubes, a modern glass floor, as well as the finest sgraffito decorations.

What there is to see at the Museum on the Pfefferberg
Since the early 1990s, the Leningrad-born Sergei Tchoban worked in Germany. He designed both the glass Cubix cinema and Chabad Lubavitch Synagogue in Berlin. However, his special passion was handmade architectural drawings. This type of art was largely replaced in the 21st century by computer technology. To celebrate such graphics, in 2009 he opened the Tchoban Foundation. Since 2013, it has been housed in the building of a former brewery on the Pfefferberg. The building seems to be loosely stacked like a Jenga tower. It is crowned with a glass cube which is used as a meeting place. The unique outer surface of the building encloses delicate architectural drawings. Architecture fans will enjoy the museum shop and extensive library on the ground floor where dark, wood-panelled walls with bookshelves characterise the interior. The two following floors are home to exhibitions, while the museum depot can be found on the third floor. Preservation of the precious drawings is aided by windowless rooms. Your attention is captured by the precision of the drawings. They include designs by Yakov Consider Chernikhov, Mies van der Rohe and Frank Gehry. One of the highlights is a drawing by Pietro di Gottardo Gonzago. In 2001, the Tchoban collection began amassing Italian 18th and 19th century works that are celebrated in Russia. The collection extends back to the 16th century, with a focus on Russian Constructivism. The museum also presents hundreds of drawings from Tchoban's own hand.

This is perhaps because, despite all the new buildings, the long history of Spandau can still really be felt in the historic centre. It’s well worth a visit to discover the architecture while strolling through the city.
A tour of the historic city centre
Coming out of the Altstadt Spandau U-Bahn station, you enter the historic city centre, which is now a pedestrian zone and shopping area. Although the old buildings have largely been destroyed in wars and fires, the alleys still maintain their medieval layout. Houses in different architectural styles stand side by side and tell the stories of different eras. One sight worth seeing is the Reformationsplatz with the St. Nikolai church, a three-aisled gothic brick church. Nearby is the Gotische Haus (“Gothic House”) (32 Breite Straße), the stone construction of which was rare and expensive for the 15th century. The network of ribbed vaulting, the double arcades of pointed arches, and the classical external façade (which was built later) all still survive. Today, the Gotische Haus is home to a city history museum and temporary exhibitions. Furthermore you will find a local tourist information with more insider tips for the area. A longer section of the remains of the city wall from the 14th survives on Viktoria-Ufer.
From the historic city centre to the Kolk and the citadel
Crossing the Am Juliusturm road you get to the “Kolk” on Behnitz island. Studies suggest that the Kolk is the oldest settlement area in Spandau. Picturesque restaurants on the Havel river, narrow alleyways, and the St. Marien am Behnitz church, which now offers cultural events, invite visitors to linger. Kolk 5, a house that was restored in the 70s, displays an extraordinary half-timbered façade. Just one U-Bahn stop away lies the Spandau Citadel, one of the most important Renaissance strongholds in Europe, in which, for example, the Citadel Music Festival takes place.

Media stations in the foyer play musical works by Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, keeping alive the tradition of the Mendelssohn family's involvement in cultural life. Under the direction of Daniel Barenboim, concerts, readings and discussions are regularly held.

In the footsteps of the Mendelssohns
For five generations, the Jewish Mendelssohn family influence social, economic and cultural life in Germany. From 1815 onwards, their bank in Berlin is an important part of Prussian finance, and possibly the most significant private bank of Berlin. In 1938, the Nazis liquidate the company. The building undergoes massive conversions during the war, housing the DEFA (a GDR film studio) for a short time. In 1998, the Mendelssohn heirs finally reacquire the building. Since 2004, the reconstructed Mendelssohn-Remise has housed the permanent exhibition „Die Mendelssohns in der Jägerstraße“ which is opened during the 18 Days of Jewish Culture that year. Today, concerts, lectures, readings and discussions celebrate this influential family. Almost every week events are held here, like for instance a revival of the 19th-century tradition of Sunday music. As you enter the permanent exhibit, you see the busts and marble pillars that once decorated the former banking hall. In the arched niches, you can read the turbulent history of the bank up to its liquidation under the Nazi regime. In addition to reports by the Mendelssohn family, meet friends and acquaintances such as the famous Alexander von Humboldt and sculptor Christian Daniel Rauch. Historic paintings recall the art patronage of the Mendelssohns: family portraits and familiar art history motifs. In addition to the main collection in the entrance hall, there is a small media station. Here you can hear reports by the Mendelssohn's descendants and compositions by Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, his elder sister Fanny Hensel and Arnold Mendelssohn. There is also a digital family tree encompassing seven generations. Take guided tours through the ""Mendelssohn Quartier"" and family attractions around the Gendarmenmarkt.

Initiated in 2004 by an East German agricultural society and the district of Lichtenberg, this park, with its woodland sheep pastures, orchards and biotopes, combines local recreation, agricultural use and nature conservation.
Ponds and pools over an area covering 100 hectares provide a habitat for frogs, toads, newts and grass snakes. In summer 2009, 35 Pomeranian sheep were introduced. The ewes with their lambs, a highlight for children, can now been seen grazing over almost 20 hectares of pasture land. This inner-city grazing as an alternative to traditional green space management together with local recreation amenities has been widely recognised as a model. As part of the »Germany – Land of Ideas«, this park was recognised as a special place in 2010.

It was built in 1908 and is supposed to be reminiscent of an Italian nobleman's tower. The building also had a practical side as it served for the pouring of lead bullets until the late 1930s. The lead plates were melted at the top of the tower. The lead droplets then fell freely and the laws of physics made them into perfectly rounded buckshot whose special accuracy was legendary among hunters. Today you can visit the tower on a guided tour. As the last of its kind in Berlin and Brandenburg, it is a listed building.

You will also enjoy the view from the house of the Wannsee and be able to learn more about the life of Liebermann and his family through a multimedia exhibition.

Liebermann's late work in his ""Chateau on the Lake""
In 1909 the painter Max Liebermann builds his summer residence in one of the most fashionable villa areas on the outskirts of Berlin. The garden is the centrepiece of the estate and is designed by Max Liebermann and Alfred Lichtwark, director of the Hamburger Kunsthalle. During the summer months up until 1935, more than 200 paintings, pastels and graphics are created here. Many are created in the garden or the area surrounding Lake Wannsee, including some portraits of Liebermann’s family. The house and property undergoes restoration between 2002 and 2006, and since then the Liebermann-Villa has become a museum dedicated to the life and work of the painter.

Visitors learn about the history of the Liebermann family and the house via multimedia stations on the ground floor. The main art exhibition is held in the artist’s original studio, with around 40 works on display, focusing on the changing themes of Liebermann’s work. Included are also works by other artists of the time. As a special feature, the museum displays Liebermann's portraits of contemporary artists Georg Kolbe, Oskar Kokoschka and Conrad Felixmüller. After your tour, enjoy a coffee and cake in the café on the garden terrace or in the former dining room.

Berlin",52.520515,13.2995181,Architecture,2,FALSE,Living at Luisenplatz,"In the post-war period, the Berlin Senate wanted to create new, modern living spaces. A generation later, however, this approach came to an end.",,,"More than any other project, the International Building Exhibition Interbau 1957 stands for modern urban renewal in West Berlin. A completely new district replaced the destroyed 19th century buildings in the Hansaviertel.
However, starting in the 1970s, resistance to large-scale construction projects grew; many renovation measures were called into question by citizens. The 1987 International Building Exhibition (IBA) was an expression of this social change. Instead of designing new housing estates, architects started to renovate old buildings and closed gaps in the cityscape left behind by the Second World War. 
One of the IBA projects was the redesign of Luisenplatz in Charlottenburg. This was a special challenge because the square is located in the immediate vicinity of Charlottenburg Palace. Next to the venerable historic palace, the new residential buildings should not look completely alien, but should not imitate its architectural style either. 
Reference to classicism
The overall design by the architects Andreas Brandt, Rudolf Böttcher and Yadegar Asisi won the Senate's competition for ideas. It consisted of four different subprojects. Brandt and Böttcher themselves, together with Horst Hielscher and Georg-Peter Mügge, planned the residential building at Charlottenburger Ufer 1. It fits into the existing development and consists of seven sections, each with a separate entrance. 
The seven sections look the same at first glance, but the architects gave them – especially the entrances – an individual touch. Common to all parts of the residential building are classicist elements such as portrait format windows and small columns in the façade – a homage to the New Pavilion built by Karl Friedrich Schinkel in 1824/25 on the other side of the Schlossbrücke bridge. 
The building at Eosanderstraße 21 also uses classicist elements. Here Brandt and Böttcher designed the façade of the upper floors symmetrically with portrait format windows. The shops on the ground floor are divided by colonnades. The building blends in harmoniously with the historic grounds of the Charlottenburg Palace and at the same time separates Luisenplatz from the traffic.
References to the classic modern age
The focal point at Luisenplatz is Hans Kollhoff's residential building with its striking brick and glass façade at Otto-Suhr-Allee 144. Kollhoff plays with elements from architectural history, but it does not refer to Baroque or Classicism, but to the master builders of Classical Modernism. The blue-coloured bricks are reminiscent of the work of Erich Mendelsohn, the glass façade over four storeys is a reference to the work of Walter Gropius, and the white flying roofs reminds one of Le Corbusier. 
However, Kollhoff's building also fits into the ensemble at Luisenplatz. It is not only in tune with the height of surrounding buildings, but also covers an existing firewall with its two lines. The architect also aimed to integrate the glass façade into the urban environment. In this way, it was intended to “mediate between the privacy of the residential building and the public character of Luisenplatz and the palace”. 
Our tips for the area around Luisenplatz
In the immediate vicinity of Luisenplatz you will find Charlottenburg Palace with its magnificent Baroque garden and the New Pavilion. You can discover other buildings of the International Building Exhibition (IBA) in Alt-Tegel, in Ritterstraße, on the Fraenkelufer and in Charlottenstraße. ",,,Grand Tour of Berlin Modernism,https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/styles/visitberlin_bleed_header_visitberlin_mobile_1x/private/image/Luisenplatz_c_visitBerlin_Foto_LeaBinger%20%282%29_DL_PPT_0.jpg?h=e5aec6c8&itok=KPmheddC,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/living-luisenplatz,,,,

Tangible history at the Stadtmuseum Berlin
The end of the 19th century calls for a city museum in Berlin, and in 1874 the Märkisches Provinzialmuseum is founded by a group of citizens. The collection outgrows the Baroque Palais Podewils, and the current structure is constructed between 1899 to 1908 under the supervision of Ludwig Hoffmann, the director of urban planning and construction. The museum is hugely popular for many years. The Berlin Wall also divides the museums, and in 1962 the Berlin Museum is built in the western part of the divided city. After reunification, the city renovates the historic museum in Köllnischer Park, and since then, visitors have been able to touch Berlin's history in the Stadtmuseum.
The museum is home to over 45 million artefacts. The permanent exhibition ""Here is Berlin!"", is an exciting experience where visitors can take a walk through the Imperial Unter den Linden to Brandenburg Gate. Themed rooms also let you discover hidden treasures, and let you learn about Berlin’s Jewish life,. You will also encounter the horse head from Schadow’s group of sculptures, which is the only remaining part of the original chariot on the Brandenburg Gate. Furthermore, young visitors will find that the museum's comprehensive programme at the laboratory encourages them to get involved with a hands-on experience of history. The Märkisches Museum and the Marinehaus will form a unity in the future and will be the centerpiece of a new museum and creative quarter at Köllnischer Park. The Marinehaus serves then as a center of activities and a municipal laboratory.
Since June 10, 2018, the newly designed permanent exhibition on Berlin's history has been open to the public in the Märkisches Museum.

Next time you’re at Alexanderplatz taking a walk along Karl-Marx-Allee, why not take a detour back to the Middle Ages for a change. The Marienkirche (St. Mary’s Church) is one of the oldest churches in Berlin.
Construction of the church
Shortly after Berlin was granted town privileges in 1230, the building of the Marienkirche began. It was probably built some time after 1250 as a parish church for the newly established town – the exact date is not known. It was first mentioned in chronicles in 1292. Today, the Marienkirche is often associated with the Nikolaikirche, the remnants of the Franziskaner-Klosterkirche and the chapel of the Heilig-Geist-Spital, all of which were built in the earliest stages of Berlin’s urban history.
The architecture of the Marienkirche
On foundations made of fieldstones, the church was built from red bricks in the local Brick Gothic style. It is a long hall church with thee naves. Wide arches and arcades make the comparatively low-ceilinged church look bigger. Cup-shaped compound piers adorn the interior. The spatial architecture is based on that of the churches of the mendicant orders, which were a very popular inspiration for town churches at the time.
Major and minor alterations
Berlin has suffered many fires during its history, and the Church of St. Mary was not spared from them. In the late 14th century it was damaged by fire and rebuilt in a modified form. From the 15th century, the church tower made of Rüdersdorf limestone was repaired and modified. Michael Mathias Smids redesigned it in 1663 in the Baroque style, and a complete Neo-Gothic overhaul was carried out in 1789 by the celebrated master builder Carl Gotthard Langhans. One of his most famous works still stands today at Pariser Platz – the Brandenburg Gate. The imposing pulpit of the protestant church was added in 1703 by Andreas Schlüter.
The Dance of Death
Today, the church’s centrepiece and main attraction, even for non-believers, is the fresco painting entitled Dance of Death. More than 22 metres long and 2 metres high, it is in the tower of the Marienkirche. Various sources date the fresco at around 1484 – the year when a plague epidemic cost many people their lives. The remaining fragments of the fresco, which depicts the dancing dead representing people from all walks of life, is exhibited behind glass. Many other panels, reliefs and inscriptions can be found in the church, which is still used today.
The Marienkirche is the oldest parish church in the city of Berlin that is still in religious use. It is situated beside the TV Tower and among the East German high-rise blocks – don’t miss this fascinating mixture in the middle of Berlin.","Opening hours

Twice a year, a festival is held and  new trees are planted by bridal couples, people celebrating the birth of a  new child, or those who wish to cel­ebrate similar events with this wonderful tradition.
The artistically designed »wedding table«, decorated with hearts, birds and the words »yes« and »no«, and surrounded by rose beds, is not just for bridal couples. The long wooden table with benches and stools can also be used as a meeting place. The trees are not only sponsored by bridal couples; to coincide with a special event, for instance a birth, graduation or company anniversary, you can plant a tree for around 100 euros and you will receive a certificate with a site map.

Although it is hard to miss, people thought it was just an ordinary wall in the decades after reunification. A hobbyist discovered the remnant and it has now been officially confirmed that this actually was a part of the former Berlin Wall.
This section was nearly forgotten for over a quarter century since the district it fell in was unclear. Until 1988, this section of the Wall was in the Pankow district, but after district boundaries were shifted, it was assigned to Reinickendorf.
 
The Wall was built by the East German government in the 1960s. Due to a shortage of materials, an old garden wall on Schützenstraße belonging to houses destroyed in the Second World War was used for this stretch of the Berlin Wall. The brick wall was later integrated into the barrier system, its height raised, and topped with barbed wire.
Most parts of the first-generation Berlin Wall were later replaced by a second-generation barrier system which was much more massive. But the section by the Schönholz S-Bahn station was preserved in its original form.

If the legendary Berlin attitude can ever be found at home, then it’s in the Mauerpark on Sundays. A relaxed amble through the stalls of the flea market, followed by a short climb up the hill and grabbing one of the coveted places on the swings and letting your gaze roam over the city before grabbing the microphone in the amphitheatre and impressing hundreds of fans at the Mauerpark karaoke.
Flea market in the Mauerpark
Directly next to the Mauerpark in Prenzlauer Berg there is a flea market, where the stalls are primarily run by private dealers rather than professional sellers. The range of wares on offer is accordingly diverse. You won’t find well-ordered displays of antiques here, instead the neighbourhood comes together to browse through old records and sell household items, clothes, musical instruments and bicycles.
Mauerpark karaoke
Joe Hatchiban has been bringing his battery-powered karaoke system to the Mauerpark every Sunday since 2009. Providing the weather is good, he’ll be there from 15:00. Then it’s your chance to perform your favourite song in front of a couple of hundred people in the amphitheatre. Joe is happy to give advice, for example if it’s time to play an air guitar solo or rip your t-shirt off during a passionate performance. You’re guaranteed to get a huge round of applause.
Events in the Mauerpark
In addition to the flea market and karaoke, the Mauerpark also attracts a great many visitors on other occasions. At Easter, families from Prenzlauer Berg hide Easter eggs in the grass and walk through the park while the children look for them. On Walpurgis Night, Berliners and visitors meet to dance until May starts and on the 21st of June every year one of the main stages of the Fête de la Musique can be also found here.
Retrospective: the history of the Mauerpark
At the time Berlin was divided, the site of the park was the border strip of the Berlin Wall and the area was off limits from 1961 to 1989. After reunification the no-man’s-land become a public park. After reconstruction work overseen by landscape architect Gustav Lange, the Mauerpark was officially opened exactly 5 years after the Wall fell on 9 November 1994.
Attractions around the Mauerpark
Families, hipsters, joggers and cyclists are all at home in the Mauerpark. Children are delighted by the Moritzhof young people’s farm where they can learn to handle animals as well as the crafts of the farmyard. Hipsters hang out in the many cafés and designer shops in the areas around Kastanienallee and Gleimstraße. The route of the Berlin Wall runs directly through the park where it not only forms a route for joggers but also a sightseeing route for cyclists.

It was the year 1927, and the city was planning a major project: Germany’s largest school was to be built in Lichtenberg, or at least the largest school complex. The fallow site at today’s Nöldnerplatz was to accommodate three different types of school: a vocational school for metal workers, a middle and elementary school and the Oberlyzeum, a grammar school for girls.

The city of Berlin did not want a conservative solution, but a modern concept. Hans Scharoun was also one of the finalists in the competition. In Berlin today he is best known for the Philharmonie concert hall built in 1960-63 and the Berlin State Library at Potsdamer Platz built in 1967-78. In 1927 things went differently than expected. It was not Scharoun who was selected, but architect Max Taut.

The built movement
Like Scharoun, Taut belonged to the innovative artists’ associations Gläserne Kette (Glass chain) and Der Ring. Their members had different concepts, but they were all united by the goal of advancing New Building: they did not want to copy historical models as before in the German Empire. Rather, they oriented their designs to the function of their buildings and wanted to harness modern production methods. The later Bauhaus directors Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius were also active in Der Ring.

Taut’s design for the school complex impressed the jury with its functional objectivity. He used reinforced concrete as a structural medium for the clearly structured alternation of windows and pillars, filling the gaps with yellow and red clinker bricks.
Walk the length of the complex once. Can you pick up the momentum resulting from this built movement? Forming a curve of over 500 metres in length, the school building follows the course of Schlichtallee and Fischerstraße.

Max Taut not only adapted the entire complex to the conditions of the course of the road, however. All functions and tasks of the building parts were precisely coordinated with each other. The three schools were independent institutions, but had access to common facilities: the central auditorium for 1,100 people, gymnasiums, an aquarium and a cinema. And not only pupils were to use the complex, but the construction task also provided for its function as a cultural and educational centre for local residents.

Taut was not able to implement all his ideas. After construction began in 1929, the world economic crisis halted the extensive work for months. Construction was not completed until 1932 – however cost reasons limited it to just two of the seven planned gymnasiums.

In 1927 a competition was announced for the construction of a new school complex on Schlichtallee/Fischerstraße in Berlin-Rummelsburg, in which Hans Scharoun, Heinz Stoffregen, Max Taut and Peter Jürgensen took part. The majority of the school complex, one of the largest new school buildings in the Weimar Republic, was completed in 1932.
New beginning as the Max-Taut-Schule
Max Taut, who did not emigrate like his brother Bruno Taut, found himself in a difficult situation from 1933. In National Socialist Germany he was excluded from public construction projects and could only implement private projects. Finally, the architect left Berlin and resettled at his parents-in-law’s in Chorin in Brandenburg.
The school complex was bombed during the Second World War, with the large auditorium being largely destroyed.
After the end of the war, the Oberlyzeum remained in a damaged state for decades. It was only between 2002 and 2007 that the EU and the State of Berlin made funds available for comprehensive refurbishment in a joint project. Architect Max Dudler was tasked with the reconstruction. Since then, the auditorium has been restored to its former glory. And not just as a monument: the complex is still a school to this day. As the “Gebäude–Umwelt–Technik” (buildings–environment–technology) upper school centre, it has since 1997 also borne the name of its famous architect: Max-Taut-Schule.

Places of interest near the Max-Taut-Schule
Not far from the Max-Taut-Schule at the Rummelsburg Bay is the Rummelsburg memorial site. A permanent exhibition on the former prison grounds, which today houses a residential complex, spans history from the workhouse in the German Empire, via Rummelsburg as an institution where so-called “antisocial elements” were collected together under National Socialism, to the central men’s prison in East Berlin, where hundreds of people were also imprisoned who took part in the protests on the occasion of the GDR state anniversary on 7 and 8 October 1989.

In the immediate vicinity of the memorial site on Köpenicker Chaussee, the expressionist clinker brick architecture of the industrial monument, Klingenberg power station, can be admired. The large power station, part of the Berlin “electropolis”, was built by AEG for the Bewag electricity company in 1925/26. The design came from Walter Klingenberg and Werner Issel and it was named after AEG Director, Georg Klingenberg.

If you follow Köpenicker Chaussee to the south-east, you will stumble upon an icon of post-war modernism on Nalepastraße. Originally built as a plywood factory, the GDR radio station was located here from 1956 to 1990. Owing to its sound quality and optimal reverberation time, Large Recording Hall 1 attracted famous musicians such as Daniel Barenboim and Kent Nagano for recordings. Architect Franz Ehrlich had already worked together with radio engineer Gerhard Probst during the planning phase. The interior design was carried out by the Deutsche Werkstätten Hellerau from near Dresden. Today, an art, music and creative location has sprung up here.

The administration building with its slim central tower dominates the port facility. The slender tower, tapering as it moves upward, has a viewing gallery, lantern and pyramid roof reminiscent of a town hall tower or lighthouse and is the landmark of the Westhafen for incoming ships. The monumental size of the port and the sophisticated technical concept of the port facilities testify to its importance for Berlin industry in the twentieth century. Having started operations in 1923, the Westhafen was an important location for the emerging industrial city of Berlin.

History of the Westhafen
Initial planning for the construction of a large port in Berlin started at the turn of the last century. Construction of the Westhafen began in 1914, but was delayed during the First World War. Responsible for the overall plan was the city's architect for civil engineering at the time, Friedrich Krause. The layout of the facilities and the façade design were based on designs by architects Wolffenstein and Lorenz. The docks and buildings are arranged according to a regular plan. The administration building, the casino, three warehouses and the granary are grouped around the central dock, while the customs house occupied the western edge of the port facility. All of the façades were uniformly faced with purplish-brown bricks with iron oxide content. The monumental appearance of the buildings is enhanced by the massive stone piers that protect the shore from waves.

A Waterfront in Transition
BEHALA (Berliner Hafen- und Lagerhaus AG) was founded in 1923 to operate the Westhafen. The port began operations that same year. The listed port facility continues to be used for shipping to this day. Parts of the warehouses are, however, no longer needed for port operations. As a result, the granary has now been converted to house the newspaper division of the Staatsbibliothek Preußischer Kulturbesitz (the Prussian state library collections). In 2001, the northern docks were filled in.",,,Industrial Architecture,https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/styles/visitberlin_bleed_header_visitberlin_mobile_1x/private/image/MeetingPlaceBerlin_03.07.2015_c_visitBerlin_Foto_Mike_Auerbach%20%28140%29_DL_PPT_0.jpg?h=68d665f8&itok=dXr1iUdD,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/westhafen-west-harbour-behala,,,,

By collecting the present and working with different people and communities from all over Europe, the museum accompanies current social and cultural processes. Intercultural understanding should be encouraged and prejudices should be reduced.

A collection full of atmosphere
Many exhibits from the Museum Europäischer Kulturen come from the Museum für Volkskunde and from the Ethnologisches Museum. These collections are brought together in the Bruno-Paul building in Berlin-Dahlem in 1999. By 2011, the building is renovated and the exhibits are rearranged and given new descriptions.

On the ground floor, you will encounter the first highlight; a splendid Venetian gondola that stands grandly upon a pedestal. Opposite the gondola, some of Europe's many textiles are presented. Through clothing, you will get an insight into the everyday culture of centuries past. In the light from the windows, a wooden cart with magnificent pictorial motifs appears. The colourful vehicle was built for Emperor Wilhelm II on a trip to Sicily. In the hallway is the bright Corpus Christi altar of the Heinzelmann family from the 1920s. The best is a saved for last: in the dim light of the grand museum awaits the mechanical Christmas mountain, where 328 movable figures depict the most important scenes of the life of Jesus Christ. This exhibition is the result of a cultural exchange between Catholic Bohemia, the Protestant Saxon and the world of the Erzgebirge mountain workers.

Southwest Berlin abounds in outstanding museums and exhibition centres, situated in an attractive natural and cultural landscape. Berlin's Green Museum Quarter offers leisure and education, history, recreation and creative inspiration like no other area in the city. Here you can find the most diverse institutions, displaying everything from ancient to modern art, from natural to cultural history. The institutions are open, living museums and exhibition venues, committed to a common idea: recreation between culture and nature.

The Domäne Dahlem is an open-air museum situated just 600m from the Museum Europäischer Kulturen. This ecological farm of agricultural and nutritional culture houses farm animals, right bang in the middle of Berlin. From here, walk for 30 minutes towards Grunewaldsee. There you will find the 16th century castle Jagdschloss Grunewald, built by Elector Joachim II. It is the oldest surviving building of its kind in Berlin.

Useful tips while visiting Museum Europäischer Kulturen
The best way to reach the museum is by underground (U3) or bus (M11, X83) via the stop Dahlem-Dorf. Those travelling by car can park in the Contipark Parkhaus Steglitzer Kreisel or in the Parkhaus APCOA. Although you are still half an hour from the museum, the route features a beautiful botanical garden. That's thirty minutes well spent in the lap of nature. Consider visiting the museum on the fourth Saturday of the month for a guided tour. The Museumspass Berlin gives you 3-day free entry to all National Museums in Berlin.","Opening hours

The congregation also owns its own library, the kids’ club ""Mo'adonit"", and the kosher restaurant Beth Café, as well as the kosher food shop Kolbo on the nearby Auguststraße.
History of the congregation
The first serving rabbi of the Adass Jisroel congregation was Rabbi Esriel Hildesheimer, who initially taught in Eisenstadt and founded the Berlin Rabbinical Seminary in 1873. During the Second World War, the Adass Jisroel congregation also suffered under Nazi ideology. In 1939, the persecution and deprivation of rights of individual congregation members led to the congregation joining the Reich Association of Jews in Germany, and ultimately to its complete destruction. Individual members in divided Berlin began rebuilding the congregation in both parts of the city in 1985. In 1997 their previous legal status was finally restored to them by a court ruling. This makes Adass Jisroel the only Jewish religious congregation that still has its original legal title, and can demonstrate continuity between the current congregation and the one founded in 1869.
Adass Jisroel today
As part of their activities, the Jewish congregation organises not only regular religious services, but also Hebrew lessons, religious classes for children and adults, lectures, and readings, among other things.

In Normannenstraße, to the east of Berlin city centre, you'll find the Stasi Museum, formerly home of the Ministry of State Security. In this building you can discover how the Stasi operates and take a look at their original technology such as bugs, hidden cameras and weapons. The main attraction is the office of Erich Mielke, Minister of State Security and head of the Stasi from 1957 to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The second floor of the building remains untouched since the days of the Stasi, complete with desks, chairs and filing cabinets.
Understand German history inside the Stasi Museum
The complex of buildings at Normannenstraße is the original financial office for the surrounding district, and it is not until 1961 that the Ministry of National Security is established in the building. Building Number 1 is then occupied by Erich Mielke for almost three decades. During the 1970s, the size of the Stasi operation expands greatly and occupies the whole site, even taking over an Apostolic Church building. This building complex becomes the control centre for surveillance throughout East Germany and an embodiment of state power. The ministry remains until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and on 15th January 1990 the building is occupied by demonstrators. There is a growing popular demand to disband the Stasi's operations and make their files public, and the process moves quickly.
By November 1990 a volunteer group mount the first public exhibition in the building, allowing ordinary East Germans in for the first time in decades - something unthinkable only a few months before. Today's visitors can see the permanent exhibition on State Surveillance during the GDR era and see the highly secretive methods used for spying on citizens. One of the stand-out exhibits is Mielke's red briefcase, in which he keeps the most sensitive information, including files on his own boss Erich Honecker. The museum also explains how informants are recruited, how the population is controlled, and ordinary people share how surveillance impacts their lives. At the heart of the museum on the second floor are the Ministerial offices, where even the curtains and telephones are untouched from the days when they were occupied by Mielke and his colleagues. The only things removed from the museum are the Stasi files, so numerous that the indexing and cataloguing process is still ongoing.

Normannenstraße is also home to exhibitions on revolution and the fall of the Berlin Wall, and include period TV recordings, news reels, documents and other media from the point of view of those who experienced it. Another interesting building is the archives of the Federal Commissioner for the Stasi documents, around 20 minutes on the underground from the Stasi Museum. Guided tours around the archives are available in English for groups booked in advance. You can also visit the site of the former men's prison at Rummelsburg, which tells stories from 21 different prisoners through Berlin's history, including the GDR. Another interesting site is the former political prison at Hohenschönhausen, where the cells and interview rooms are preserved to give insight into the methods used by the regime. Tours are guided by former prisoners who tell you about their experiences. It will take about 30 minutes by tram or bus to get to the museum. Something a little different, but still relevant to life in the East German regime is the Computerspielemuseum

As a motorist, you can park for free directly in front of the museum entrance. But it is also reached comfortably by public transport: the BVG bus 125 stops at Seekorso or Kurpromenade, both a 10 minute walk from the museum. Cyclists can take advantage of the BVG ferry F10 from Wannsee to Alt-Kladow. Admission is generally free of charge. Join in the public guided tours on weekends.","Opening hours

A hidden gem in Köpenick
One of the most beautiful and least-known places in Berlin is hidden away between the lakes 
Müggelsee and Dämeritzsee. It’s a settlement of residential and holiday homes that can’t be explored in a gondola or a Spreewald barge, but is perfectly accessible by small boat or canoe. Typically for Berlin, it’s authentic and relaxed. Neu-Venedig is one of the city’s best-kept secrets for sightseers. Succumb to the charms of Berlin’s little Venice with its water lilies and swans – either on foot or on a bicycle tour.
The beginnings of Neu-Venedig
The story of Neu-Venedig began in 1890, when the town of Köpenick purchased the estates of Rahnsdorf and Hessenwinkel. Originally, the marshy ground was to be drained so that housing could be built there, but in 1926, canals were built instead, giving water sports enthusiasts direct access to the Müggelspree. The five kilometres of newly created waterways originally gained the nickname “New Cameroon”. It was only later that comparisons were drawn with Venice and the Italian lagoons.
Dachas for East German ministers
When Neu-Venedig was created in 1928, it was divided into 374 waterside plots. The number has since risen to 450. Small villas were built on the outside of the leisure settlement, with summer houses in the middle. From 1961, privileged GDR citizens leased the property of West Berliners. Neu-Venedig became a popular place for the small weekend homes known as dachas. Later, the plots were returned to their legal owners.
Traditional cuisine in Neu-Venedig
A restaurant as famous as the area itself offers traditional cuisine to restore the strength of hungry boaters and tourists seeking relaxation. The country pub has a large garden directly by the waterside.",,,Day trips from Berlin,https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/styles/visitberlin_bleed_header_visitberlin_mobile_1x/private/image/mueggelsee09_c_visitBerlin_Foto_Dagmar_Schwelle_DL_PPT_0.jpg?h=06f6671c&itok=nLhazfCw,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/neu-venedig,,,,

And among the woods and the water, you’ll forget you’re in a global metropolis",,,"With its cobbled streets lined by ancient chestnut trees and its centuries-old buildings behind wrought-iron fences, everything is tranquil in the fishing village and heritage site of Rahnsdorf. Idyllically located where the Spree meets the Müggelsee. The perfect place for a day out, and not just for Berliners.

A fishing village for more than 500 years
Rahnsdorf forms a horseshoe around its village church, as you can easily see from the stretch of the river known as the Müggelspree. It was first documented in 1375 as a Slav settlement. Around 100 years later it was granted fishing rights – and it still has them now. Fisherman Andreas Thamm has been heading out to the Müggelsee every morning at 5 o’clock for the last 35 years. At weekends in the summer, he lights his smoker and sells his freshly caught fish to day trippers. Eel, trout and carp are all on the menu.

Not far from the smokehouse is the dock of the F24 ferry. The ferryman rows 36 metres to take his passengers across the Müggelspree to the Müggelwiesen on the other side, from where they can bike or hike around the Müggelsee or up to the Müggelberge hills. The second, slightly bigger, solar-powered ferry F23 takes its passengers to Müggelhort and Müggelwerderweg. Both ferries sail every hour in the summer.

From Rahnsdorf to Neu-Venedig
Rahnsdorf is not just a day out for hikers and cyclists – a day on the water is just as rewarding. In a canoe, on a stand-up paddleboard or in a small motor boat you can sail along the canals in Neu-Venedig (New Venice), past well-kept holiday homes and herons going about their business. Sometimes all you can hear is the water lapping about the bows. By the time you get to the Müggelsee it’s time to take a refreshing dip. And best of all, if your belly’s rumbling after all that paddling and splashing about, you can pull in at the mooring that fisherman Andreas Thamm keeps specially for boaters.",,,Day trips from Berlin,https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/styles/visitberlin_bleed_header_visitberlin_mobile_1x/private/image/mueggelsee18_c_visitBerlin_Foto_Dagmar_Schwelle_DL_PPT_0.jpg?h=06f6671c&itok=68ALzZPj,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/former-fishing-village-rahnsdorf,,,,

The collection includes small objects; clay tablets, pieces of jewellery, vessels, reconstructions of magnificent buildings and throne rooms with original facades. Highlights are the blue glazed Ishtar Gate, one of the Babylonian city gates. This exhibition of the Middle East is a leader in its kind. You can find it in the Pergamon Museum, one of Berlin's national museums on Museum Island.
Ancient treasures from the Orient
The second half of the 19th century is a great moment in archaeological history. Excavation fever leads many German researchers to travel to the Middle East, discovering numerous stone witnesses to the past and bringing them to Berlin. In 1899, a separate collection of art from the Middle East is founded to house the treasures. Initially, the collection is part of today's Bode-Museum but has found its permanent home in the Pergamon Museum from 1929. Since 1999, it has been part of the UNESCO World Heritage site of Museum Island. The monumental architecture of the Pergamon Museum is typical of the Wilhelminian era. Over 35 metres wide, the Pergamon's pediment is the pièce de résistance. Behind the facade, to the left, you find the Vorderasiatisches Museum. 14 rooms with an area of 2,000 square metres stretch out before you. High, white walls dominate, creating an ambience of grandeur. On these walls, Oriental artworks appear in great contrast. Walk through a reconstructed Babylonian processional way to the authoritative Ishtar Gate. The blue tiled walls with their animal paintings conjure up the rest of the former fortifications. In addition to this central exhibit, you can see fragments of the Temple of Inanna of Uruk. The detailed reliefs on the facade are worth noting. Many of the exhibits are replicas and casts of originals; the Oriental animal sculptures, for example. The museum displays jewellery, religious artefacts and legal documents in cuneiform script. In total, the collection spans over 6,000 years of art and cultural history.

Exile and return: Heinz Berggruen and his collection
Shortly before the outbreak of the First World War, the future art patron and collector Heinz Berggruen is born in Berlin-Wilmersdorf. In the 1930s, this scion of a Jewish family is forced to emigrate by the Nazis. Berggruen heads to the United States but returns to Europe after the Second World War. He becomes a major art dealer in Paris and, after over 60 years of exile, returns to his home town in 1996. His private art collection is then brought to the reunited city, on permanent loan to the National Gallery. The Berlin Senate offers him a former officers' barracks located opposite 
Charlottenburg Palace and the Stüler building, to use as an exhibition venue. This neoclassical building, with its distinctive dome, is perfect as a home for the exquisite collection. Immediately upon entering, you are met by Giacometti's sculpture Large Standing Woman III, which appears to be a concierge welcoming guests. From here you can take the impressively elegant staircase, enhanced by a glass dome, to visit three floors where the collection Picasso and his World is shown. See highlights such as Seated Harlequin and House on a Hill in peaceful surroundings with bright rooms providing an intimate atmosphere in which to encounter the art works. Travel through a glass passageway to the Commander’s House which serves as an extension to the Berggruen Museum. Here you can view the works of the second-most important artist of the museum, Paul Klee. Exhibits include drawings like Gallows Humour and colour and design studies from his time at the Bauhaus, numbering 70 in total.

Here, next to the Berggruen Museum, art nouveau and art deco meet with modern design. The house presents functionalist pieces of furniture from the 1920s and 1930s and paintings of the Berlin secession movement.

In 1907, artists and entrepreneurs establish the Deutscher Werkbund. They want objects that are honest, functional, simple and sustainable. The Werkbund designs objects, but always focuses on the future. That's why the DWB founds the Werkbundarchiv Berlin in 1971. Here, the group documents and reflects on the history of product culture. It amasses a sizeable collection ranging from aesthetic commodities to souvenirs, high-profile designer pieces to NoName mass productions. As you go through the repository, situated in a factory building, wooden display cases are stacked with characteristic blue Nivea cans. In another, a crowd of toy figures - Smurfs, Garfield, or Donald Duck. The line between garage and commercial value is quickly blurred. A different case is dominated by simple design: curved glass vases and functional watering cans. The museum has arranged the collection deliberately. In the central room, display cabinets are organised thematically. Here you will find the works of the German Werkbund, that both contrast and are congruent with the objects of today. A unique exhibit is the Frankfurt kitchen. Designed in 1926 by Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky, this standardised kitchen is a prime example of the response to the urban housing shortage and rising population figures after World War II. Economic, efficient, and cheap housing was accompanied by simple facilities. Its combination of aesthetics and efficiency places it at the core of German Werkbund values: sustainable, rational and functional.

There is an ""Artothek"", an art library where, for a small fee, non-members can borrow a work of art for up to six months. Here, visitors are invited to browse more than 4000 pieces produced by young artists and students from Berlin’s universities of arts – and take home their favourite pieces if they wish. Exhibitions change regularly in both form and content and tend to focus on current topics, from what’s happening in Berlin to society in general.
The ""Art for Everyone"" motto brings a freshness to Berlin’s art scene. As well as making art more accessible to the public, the institution is instrumental in supporting Berlin-based artists. People who don’t have the money to buy expensive works, or for those that simply love change, the opportunity to borrow art pieces is one not to miss. But it’s not all about two dimensional art. The museum houses a collection of more than 1,600 internationally-made films which often form part of screenings and presentations. These films range from those made in the association’s early days in the 1960s, to more recent ones, and since 2008, the entire collection has been available for viewing in a separate space.

Minimalist décor brings the artworks to the forefront: walls are painted black or white, and the concrete floors have been left bare. The modes of art vary greatly, from colourful installations and photographs to watercolours, delicate line drawings and glass-bound prints. But whatever is on display, you can be sure that the museum is bringing people closer to art, and at the same time, is acting as a wind stirring up the art world itself.

Here you can experience more than 100 years of German film history, along with 50 years of the television history of both East and West Germany, all the way from the first jerky pictures of the silent film era and the earliest sound films of the 1930s. Relax and feel at home in the armchairs of the media station, enjoying the highlights of film and television history. Another highlight of the museum is the Marlene Dietrich Collection which includes show costumes and personal items belonging to the world-famous and legendary actress from Berlin.

From “Metropolis” and “The Blue Angel” to contemporary films
1963 is the founding year of the Deutsche Kinemathek — a film archive created by director Gerhard Lamprecht. This, and the film collection of Albert Fidelius, form the basis of the museum’s extensive collection. In 2000, the cinema moves to the Filmhaus am Potsdamer Platz, and six years later, the television museum is set up leading to the Museum for Film and Television. The exhibition focuses on German film, actors and film makers, such as Heinz Rühmann and Marlene Dietrich. Dietrich celebrates many successes in Berlin during the 1930s and later in Hollywood.

You can admire the most beautiful objects from her private estate, as well as many of her famous costumes, including the swan coat and the well known male suit she wears in her androgynous role in the 1930s film “Morocco”. Explore memorabilia, including her letters and dolls, which accompany Dietrich on all her journeys and offer insight into her private life. You can watch excerpts from early films, which have retained all their fascination and charisma over the years including the 1927 silent film “Metropolis” by Fritz Lang which is the first science fiction feature film of its kind. As you stroll through the rooms, you can admire huge portraits from film and television history, featuring costumes and props from old films. In the television museum, enjoy watching the final game of the Football World Cup in 1954, a legendary win for the West German team, or news footage from the fall of the Berlin Wall. Relaxing in the many multimedia stations will renew memories of moments that have changed the world.

The Altes Museum on Berlin’s Museum Island takes visitors back to explore antiquity, allowing you to admire the fascinating works of the Romans, Greeks and Etruscans. Marvel at small treasures such as vases and jewellery to larger pieces of art and sculptures.

Discover the antique treasures of Altes Museum

An icon of Neoclassical architecture, the Altes Museum is truly impressive. Completed in 1830, the monumental pillars, expansive atrium and rotunda lined with antique sculptures resemble the Pantheon in Rome. The museum is initially commissioned to house the Prussian royal family’s art collection. On seeing the magnificence of the museum upon completion, King Friedrich Wilhelm IV designates the northern part of Spree Island (now known as Museum Island) a sanctuary for art and science. Since its creation, the building has had numerous renovations, both to expand and repair. This most notably happens after a truck explodes outside the museum in WW2. Now, the primary collection houses Greek and Roman art and sculptures, with special exhibitions running periodically. After being greeted by the 18 towering pillars, an imposing staircase leads you on to the museum’s different collections. You are guided chronologically through the spectacular artworks, starting with Ancient Greece, from the 10th until the 1st century BC. Then you continue onto a remarkable collection of gold and silver jewellery. You’ll also discover the ‘Blue Chamber’ filled with a fascinating array of historical coins.

Highlights to see on Museum Island

The Altes Museum's location in the heart of Museum Island means there are plenty of things to discover nearby. Just north of the Altes Museum is the Neues Museum which displays Egyptian, prehistorical and early historical collections. Amongst the many treasures housed here is the famed bust of the Egyptian queen Nefertiti. Built slightly later than the previous two museums, the Pergamon Museum is the most visited in the city. Whilst it also has an antiquity collection, it houses a wonderful collection of Islamic and Middle Eastern art. You’re sure to be wowed by the lovingly reassembled monumental structures such as the Market Gate of Miletus. Another museum in the area is the Alte Nationalgalerie, which forms part of the Berlin National Gallery and showcases a variety of Neoclassical, Romantic, Impressionist and early Modernist artworks. For something a bit different, visit the permanent and temporary exhibitions at the Deutsches Historisches Museum. Devoted to German history, from political culture to current affairs, it contains a cinema and a library for further research.

Preparing for your visit

Getting to Museum Island is straightforward because of its central location. The nearest parking garage is located on Karl-Liebknecht-Straße, opposite the Berlin Cathedral. If you’re coming via public transport, then you can take one of the S-Bahn lines S5, S7 or S75 to Hackescher Markt station. From there it is around a 600-metre walk to the Altes Museum. Alternatively, you can take buses 100 or 200 and get off at Am Lustgarten. The Altes Museum is open six days a week, being closed on Mondays. If you’d prefer to explore the museum at a leisurely pace and with more room, it is recommended to arrive just after opening time. The museum is open later each Thursday, when there are also fewer visitors. You can use the Berlin Welcome Card Museum Island to explore all the museums on Museum Island over three consecutive days. With a Museum Pass Berlin you can visit 50 other museums in Berlin for free. If it interests you, the museum also offers special rates for group tours and school classes when booking in advance.

Museum Island and its buildings

Berlin’s Museum Island is a grand work of art: five world-famous museum buildings from the time of the Prussian rulers, together with the modern James Simon Gallery, form an exciting ensemble that was awarded UNESCO World Heritage status in 1999. In 1999, the Museum Island master plan was also adopted. The core of this is an underground connection, the Archaeological Promenade, to be built between the museum buildings.

History of Museum Island

The Altes Museum (Old Museum) is located at Lustgarten, directly opposite the Berlin Cathedral and the new Humboldt Forum. With its opening in 1830, historically significant collections and artworks were made accessible to the general public in Berlin for the first time. The idea of a museum open to everyone goes back to the Enlightenment and its educational ideals. Karl Friedrich Schinkel, Prussia’s most important architect, provided the designs. Over the next 100 years, a total of five museums were built on the site. And at the end of the 1870s, Berlin’s Museum Island received its current name.

By 1855, a second impressive museum building was erected according to the plans of Friedrich August Stüler: the Royal Prussian Museum, today’s Neues Museum (New Museum). In 1876, the Alte Nationalgalerie (Old National Gallery), with architecture reminiscent of a Greek temple and incorporating Stüler’s designs, opened its doors. It took until the beginning of the 20th century to complete the ensemble. In 1904, the neo-baroque Kaiser Friedrich Museum at the tip of the Museum Island, today’s Bode Museum, opened. And in 1930, the Pergamon Museum was added as the last of the five large museum buildings.

The Nazis planned a gigantic conversion, which fortunately could not be implemented. After the war, Museum Island was a landscape of ruins, the Neues Museum in particular was almost completely destroyed. Reconstruction began during GDR times, but the Neues Museum still remained a ruin.

In 1999, 10 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Board of Trustees decided on a comprehensive restoration of the ensemble, entitled Museum Island’s master plan. This included the reconstruction of the Neues Museum and the restoration of the other museums. In addition, the individual museum buildings, each of which faces a different direction, were to be connected to form one large, unified whole.

A modern central entrance and exhibition building, the James Simon Gallery, has been welcoming guests since July 2019.

The British star architect David Chipperfield accepted the commission for planning the James Simon Gallery. His firm David Chipperfield Architects had already overseen the reconstruction of the Neues Museum. James Simon (1851-1932), a Jewish citizen in Berlin and a passionate art collector, now receives special recognition for the first time: he was the most important patron of Museum Island, who provided Berlin’s museums with extensive collections. His most famous transfer of ownership to Museum Island is under the northern dome in the Neues Museum: the bust of Nefertiti.

The Archaeological Promenade will connect four of the five museums and exhibit important objects from the art collections.

The three-winged Pergamon Museum by Alfred Messel is the most visited museum in Berlin. It displays the Collection of Classical Antiquities, the Museum of the Ancient Near East and the Museum of Islamic Art. The Collection of Classical Antiquities is one of the most important collections of Greek and Roman art in the world. The most famous work is the Roman Pergamon Altar, whose sculpted frieze depicts the battle between gods and giants. As part of the master plan for Museum Island, the Pergamon Museum is being gradually renovated and a fourth wing will be added. In the course of this renovation, the hall with the Pergamon Altar is expected to be closed until 2025. A further highlight of Roman architecture, the approximately 17-metre-high Market Gate of Miletus, can still be viewed. Also on display are the highlights of the Museum of the Ancient Near East, the Babylonian Ishtar Gate with the Processional Way, and the artefacts of the Museum of Islamic Art.

Restoration of the Bode Museum at the tip of Museum Island was completed back in 2005. In its magnificent halls it houses a unique collection of sculptures, showcasing exhibits from the Middle Ages to the 19th century, including works from Donatello, Bernini and Canova. Other treasures are housed in the Museum of Byzantine Art and the Numismatic Collection. Together with works of European sculpture, works from Berlin’s Gemäldegalerie (Picture Gallery) are also on display. Since July 2019, visitors can once again visit the James Simon Cabinet in its original room, which was closed as a result of anti-Semitism under the Nazi dictatorship.

In summer, the riverbank opposite is a popular meeting place for Berliners and their visitors because of the beautiful view of the northern tip of Museum Island.

The reconstruction and renovation of the Neues Museum by the renowned architect David Chipperfield took a total of ten years. A sensitive approach to the old building and the traces of war, combined with ultra-modern conversions, resulted in an exciting, unusual architectural style that has not lost its authentic character. Since the spectacular reopening in 2009, the building has housed selected exhibits from the Egyptian Museum and Papyrus Collection, the Museum of Prehistory and Early History and the Collection of Classical Antiquities. The world-famous bust of Nefertiti is presented in a special octagonal room under the northern dome.

Like an ancient temple, the Alte Nationalgalerie (Old National Gallery) rises above Museum Island on its high stepped pedestal. It is clear that Greek temples served as a model for the architect, Friedrich August Stüler. The Alte Nationalgalerie houses paintings and sculptures from Classicism, Romanticism, Biedermeier, Impressionism and the early Modern Age. It is considered to be one of the most comprehensive collections of art from the period between the French Revolution and the First World War. World-famous works such as The Monk by the Sea by Caspar David Friedrich and The Thinker by Auguste Rodin can be found here, as well as works by Schinkel, Menzel, Manet, Monet and Renoir among many others. Right at the entrance, visitors are welcomed by the most beautiful couple in Prussia: the famous Princesses Group by Johann Gottfried Schadow.

The classical building, the Altes Museum, designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel in 1830 was the first museum building on the island. And for the first time, the royal art collections were shown to the public in a specially designed antique-style building. Today, countless masterpieces of classical antiquity are exhibited alongside the magnificent architecture with its expansive circular dome: Sculpture, jewellery, vases and coins from Greek and Etruscan art, as well as from the Roman Empire. Gold and silver jewellery is displayed under a blue ceiling in a special treasure chamber.

"Hellersdorfer Straße 179
12627 
Berlin",52.5343,13.59305,Architecture,2,FALSE,Museumswohnung WBS 70 (museum apartment),Contemporary history close up,,,"When you enter the Museumswohnung WBS 70, you will embark on a journey through time. Here the GDR comes to life once more.

Furniture and furnishings at Hellersdorfer Straße 179 provide authentic flair: from the upholstered green couch and the Rafena television in the living room to original GDR cookware and food items in the kitchen. Details such as wallpaper, floor coverings, décor, books and records allow visitors to immerse themselves in the everyday world of the GDR.

And the most frequently reproduced GDR work of art could not be forgotten: a print of Walter Womacka’s painting ""Am Strand"" hangs on the wall.

The Museumswohnung is part of a housing estate built in 1986 by the Cottbus housing combine. It not only conveys impressions of the furniture and consumer goods from this period, but is also a living testimony to the construction of the large GDR housing estate.

Prefabricated Plattenbau buildings as a solution
At the beginning of the 1970s, the GDR was suffering from a housing shortage. The government’s response was a large-scale project to build as many apartments as possible in a short time and at a reasonable cost. By 1990, every citizen was meant to have their own apartment.

The prefabricated construction method had proven itself since the end of the 1950s. Assembling precast concrete elements turned out to be cheaper and faster than steel skeleton construction and traditional masonry construction.

Initially, however, prefabricated housing also caused problems. For example, the residential building type P 2 incorporated too many special components, driving up costs. The GDR government was under pressure to streamline the prefabricated building more in order to hit its ambitious target.

Convertible success model
The architects and town planners Wilfried Stallknecht and Achim Felz were commissioned with the development of the WBS 70 (short for Wohnungsbauserie or ‘residential building series’, while the number stands for the year 1970).

Together they devised a construction method based on standardised technical and architectural principles. They designed apartments as functional units which, when combined, constituted the parts of the building.

In order to be able to build even faster, only prefabricated parts with a length of six metres were used. Since the exterior walls were to bear the weight of the building, the design of the floor plans in the WBS 70 was optional. The architects could also vary the façade by adding elements.

Convertible unlike any other prefabricated building type, the WBS 70 evolved into a popular and widespread building in the GDR, characterising the look and feel of the country.

Higher, faster – yet unsuccessful
In East Berlin in particular there was an urgent need for new apartments. With a view to Berlin’s 750th anniversary in 1987, a major construction project was launched on the outskirts of the divided city in the 1970s: in the districts of Marzahn, Hohenschönhausen and Hellersdorf, the GDR government built 91,400 new apartments in around ten years – the largest prefabricated housing estate in Europe. According to the GDR news service ADN, it usually took a city centuries to achieve such an increase in living space.

The streamlined design of the WBS 70 made this possible. An apartment like the one at Hellersdorfer Strasse 179 could be built in around 18 hours. And the rents for the WBS 70 apartments were low. A 3-room apartment of 61 square metres cost 109 Marks a month – just over ten percent of a worker’s average monthly income. This was not solely attributable to the prefabricated construction method, as rents and ancillary costs were subsidised by the state.

The apartments of the WBS 70 were highly sought-after. Each had its own bathroom, hot water and district heating – unlike the largely unmodernised Altbau buildings. After the reunification of Germany, however, their limitations became apparent: a few years after their completion, the buildings were in need of renovation. In addition, the housing market in Berlin had started offering new opportunities. Many people no longer wanted to live in a prefabricated apartment and moved out.

Conversion into a museum apartment
In 2004, the building housing the Museumswohnung WBS 70 was renovated. The municipal housing company Stadt und Land decided to preserve part of the GDR’s architectural heritage.

By carefully bringing together authentic furnishing elements, it was possible to capture the flair of this period. Wolfgang Sawatzki from Hellersdorf organises guided tours of the apartment, where he tells anecdotal stories about life in the WBS 70.","Opening hours

Berlin’s City Hall at Alexanderplatz in Mitte is one of the city’s most famous sights. Its nickname Rotes Rathaus comes from the red bricks it was built from. It is the seat of the city’s mayor and government.
Neo-Renaissance architecture
The Rotes Rathaus was built between 1861 and 1869 from plans by Hermann Waesemann. The Neo-Renaissance building has several wings with round arches and three courtyards. A 74-metre-high tower completes the red brick ensemble.
From the second world war to the present
The building was severely damaged during the Second World War, but was rebuilt soon afterwards. Following the city’s partition, the Rotes Rathaus served as the town hall for East Berlin, while on the other side of the wall, West Berlin’s senate met at the Rathaus Schöneberg. In 1991, the Rotes Rathaus again became the seat of the united city’s government, and the Mayor of Berlin also has his offices here.

The heraldic hall and other rooms
The Rotes Rathaus contains many impressive rooms which are well worth a visit.
The heraldic hall (with the coats of arms of all Berlin’s boroughs) is where state visitors are received.
The great banqueting hall is used for events such as official receptions and ceremonies.
The most beautiful hall is the nine-metre-high pillared hall with its orange rib-vaulted ceiling and many busts of prominent people. At one time, the library was housed here, and now there are often exhibitions.
In the corridors of the third floor, there are portraits of all Berlin’s honorary citizens, drawn by Rolf Dübner.
The Rathaus and its exhibitions are open Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., but please note that it is sometimes temporarily closed because of day-to-day business or for security reasons. It is best to check in advance by calling (030) 9026-2032. The senate office also organises guided tours of the city hall for groups.

It is a memorial and an important centre of Jewish life.,,,"On the night of the 9th of November 1938, synagogues all over Germany were burnt down. The SA also set fire to the Neue Synagoge in Berlin, but the head of the local police precinct, Wilhelm Krützfeld, insisting that it was a historical listed building, called the fire brigade to put out the fire. He was one of the few people on the night of the November Pogrom to stand up to the destruction and the persecution of their Jewish neighbours.
Today, the golden dome of the synagogue still gleams over the centre of Berlin. The building, which houses a permanent exhibition, is not only one of the city’s most outstanding buildings, but also a centre of Jewish culture and an important place of remembrance.
The history of the Neue Synagoge
Once, the Neue Synagoge was the biggest and most magnificent Jewish places of worship in Germany, and a confident expression of Berlin’s established Jewish citizenry. Designed by Eduard Knoblauch in the Moorish style, it was built between 1859 and 1866. When Knoblauch became seriously ill, Friedrich August Stüler took over the construction. Stüler was a major Prussian figure at the time, a student of Karl Friedrich Schinkel and one of Berlin’s foremost architects. With its ingenious spatial design and the sophisticated steel structure of its galleries and roof, the Neue Synagoge was an architectural wonder of its day. The large main hall and the galleries have space for up to 3000 worshippers. The building was crowned by a gilded dome visible for miles around. The entrance facade is lavishly decorated with brick ornamentation and flanked by two towers, also topped with gilded domes.
Not everyone in the Jewish community was enamoured with its bombastic style. Liberals felt that the Moorish style emphasised the otherness of their religion. Some conservatives who rejected other innovations left the congregation and founded the orthodox community Adass Jisroel.
In the second world war, bombs almost completely destroyed the building. After the war there was only a small Jewish community in East Berlin. In 1958, the authorities demolished the main hall of the synagogue, saying that it was at risk of collapsing. Only the parts of the parts of the building facing the street remained as a memorial against war and fascism.
On the 50th anniversary of the November Pogrom, a foundation called Stiftung Neue Synagoge Berlin – Centrum Judaicum was established with the purpose of rebuilding the synagogue. The restored and modernised building opened in 1995, after German reunification. Instead of reconstructing the demolished building, only the façade and the gilded dome were restored. Stones set in the ground indicate the huge size of the original synagogue and give a striking impression of the destruction.
The Neue Synagoge and the Centrum Judaicum are now one of the most important centres of Jewish life in Germany.
Centrum Judaicum
Although the building has a prayer room, it was not rededicated as a synagogue. It is a focal point for Jewish life in Berlin, an assembly venue, and a place of teaching and learning with an archive and a large library for academic research.

From classical modernism to colour field painting
Mies van der Rohe's last independent work, the Neue Nationalgalerie, opens in 1968 on Reichpietschufer near Potsdamer Platz. The building with the ergonomic hall and floating roof is an architectural icon, and its minimalist design works in harmony with the modern collection. While temporary exhibitions take place in the building's Glass Pavilion, the permanent exhibition is housed in the basement. To the west, a door leads to a leafy sculpture garden under the open sky. It's inspired by the sculpture garden of the MoMa in New York and showcases high-calibre sculptures from Richard Sierra and Barnett Newman. During your tour, you'll experience great milestones of painting and sculpture - from classical modernism to the 1980s. A focal point of the collection is German expressionism: with Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Otto Dix and Max Beckmann all making appearances. Dalí, Miró and Picasso dip into surrealism. Klee and Kandinsky give an insight into the doctrine of the Bauhaus - the world famous art and design movement. On large canvases, abstract and colourful, the American painters Barnett Newman, Frank Stella and Ellsworth Kelly proclaim a new era.

It stands in the Neue Wache, Germany's central memorial for the victims of war and tyranny.

The history of the Neue Wache
The building on the boulevard Unter den Linden has always been a memorial. Karl Friedrich Schinkel, Prussia’s most important and famous architect, designed the building as a memorial to those who had fallen in the Napoleonic Wars and the Wars of Liberation. It was his first work in Berlin. At the same time, the building served as a guardhouse for the royal troops – and did so until the end of the monarchy in 1918.  
The Neue Wache was built entirely in the Neoclassical style: a row of columns and a gable frieze with the goddess of victory decorated the sandstone-coloured building. However, only the frontage was real sandstone; in the notoriously cash-struck Prussia, the rear and side walls were merely painted in the same colour
In 1931 Heinrich Tessenow created a Memorial to the Victims of the Great War. Shortly before the end of the Second World War, the Neue Wache was hit by bombs and severely damaged.
From 1960, the GDR used the restored building as a Memorial to the Victims of Fascism and Militarism, with an eternal flame burning in the middle of the room. In 1969, the mortal remains of an unknown soldier and a nameless concentration camp victim were interred, surrounded by soil from Second World War battlefields and concentration camps. They still remain under the new memorial plaque today.
Until 1990, every week there was a changing of the guard at the memorial, with soldiers marching up and down in goose step.

The memorial
Since 1993 the Neue Wache has been the Central Memorial of the Federal Republic of Germany to the Victims of War and Dictatorship. In the centre of the bare, simple, top-lit room is an enlarged replica of the statue Mother with her Dead Son by Käthe Kollwitz. Chancellor Helmut Kohl’s choice of Kollwitz’s Pietà gave rise to a lengthy and lively discussion on whether it was a suitable memorial to the actual victims of the Nazis.",,,,https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/styles/visitberlin_bleed_header_visitberlin_mobile_1x/private/image/Neue%20Wache_iStock_c_chrisdorney_DL_PPT_0.jpg?h=b76d0694&itok=4sAWZh60,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/neue-wache-memorial,,,,

The Nefertiti Bust is showcased alone in the domed hall in the north of the building - an impressive exhibit. The rest of the museum's buildings are equally impressive, and strike the perfect balance between modern style and classicism. It's no surprise that the Neues Museum is one of the most important 19th century buildings in Germany.

New interpretation of a classic museum building

The Neues Museum is built by classicist architect Friedrich August Stuler in the 19th century and is initially designed as an extension to the Old Museum. The museum is closed to the public during the Second World War and the building is extensively damaged during the bombing of Berlin. After the War ends, the condition of the building means that the museum remains closed, and it's not until 2003 that reconstruction begins under the supervision of famous British architect David Chipperfield. The original structure is preserved, with modern additions to the structure added. The Neues Museum finally reopens to the public in 2009.

Today's museum brings together artefacts from the Egyptian Museum and Papyrus Collection, and collections covering Early History and Pre-History. With 8,000 square metres over four separate levels, the museum contains around 9,000 historical exhibits. Why not visit the Ancient Egyptians by exploring the restored sacrificial tombs with real mummies in the basement? Or take a look at the impressive Barbarian Treasure trove, a collection of objects recovered from the bed of the River Rhine and thought to have been plundered during the 3rd century AD. High ceilings, arches and original frescoes frame the exhibits perfectly. Don't miss the extraordinary Berliner Green Head from ca. 350 BC. On the third level you will find an exhibition exploring life in the Stone, Bronze and Iron Ages, where the standout exhibit is the famous Berlin Gold Hat — an elaborate golden headdress thought to be around 3,000 years old. Then take a trip through the archaeological world where you will see finds from several digs, along with explanations about the different archaeological methods used to excavate them. Finally, you'll arrive in the Stone Age, where items from the earliest human periods are on show.

Other things to see on Museum Island

Right next to the Neues Museum on the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Museum Island, is the Alte Nationalgalerie, Berlin's biggest art gallery. The exterior of the building is impressive, but not as impressive as the gallery's contents. The museum features works by neoclassical, impressionist and modernist painters such as Claude Monet and Paul Cézanne. Walk over to the Pergamon Museum, home to Middle Eastern antiquities and an important collection of Islamic Art. The reconstructed Ishtar Gate from Babylon is the must-see exhibit at the Pergamon. The Bode Museum, which reopens in 2006 after a multi-million euro refurbishment, provides a home for collections of coins, medals, Byzantine art and sculpture.

It runs from Kiefholzstraße in the north to the Britz Canal in the south, crossing Sonnenallee along the way. Sonnenallee has become famous across Germany thanks to the 1999 comedy film of the same name directed by Leander Haussmann. The film, sometimes known as ""Sun Alley"" in English, tells about the life of young people in East Germany sometime in the late 70s or early 80s. Although the real Sonnenallee looks different than shown in the movie, the street was actually once divided by the Berlin Wall. It divided the part of Sonnenallee in Neukölln from that lying to the east in the Baumschulenweg neighbourhood. The western section became a modern, car-friendly suburban settlement in the 70s and 80s, while the eastern section slowly decayed. Circumstances have since changed: Today, many of the older buildings have been handsomely renovated, while the former flagship estates in Neukölln are rife with social tensions. Sonnenallee was also a border crossing for Berliners during the years of division.

Berlin",52.5166501,13.4078135,Attractions,1,FALSE,Nikolai quarter,Narrow streets and cosy houses – the charm of old Berlin comes to life in the idyllic Nikolaiviertel. Discover Berlin as it once was.,,,"As you leave the busy metropolis behind you, there are small houses instead of tall buildings, narrow streets instead of wide boulevards. Only the giant Television Tower above the rooftops reminds you that Nikolaiviertel is not a romantic village but in the middle of bustling Berlin.

The idyllic Nikolaiviertel is Berlin’s oldest residential quarter, but most of its mediaeval-looking streets and quaint houses were in fact built after the war.

The history of the Nikolaiviertel

In the middle ages, a trading route passed through Berlin at this place. Tradesmen and merchants settled where the road crossed the river. Around 1200, the Nikolaikirche was built. It was the heart of the new settlements of Berlin and Cölln on either side of the Spree, now connected by Mühlendamm.

 

Until the Second World War, the quarter was characterised by taverns, shops, courtyards and tradesmen’s workshops. Artists such as Kleist, Hauptmann, Ibsen, Casanova, Strindberg and Lessing lived or lodged here. Bombing raids then largely destroyed the area in 1944, and it remained a disused landscape of rubble for many years.

The ruined quarter was not restored until the run-up to Berlin’s 750th anniversary celebrations in 1987. Beginning in 1981, a team headed by the architect Günter Stahn got to work. The houses were reconstructed according to historical records, giving the illusion that a part of old Berlin had returned. The prefabricated Communist high-rises all around make it look like a dolls’ village. With its idyllic charm and many restaurants, cafés and pubs, it’s one of the city’s most popular attractions.

Nikolaikirche



The Nikolaikirche (St. Nicholas’s Church), with its striking double spire, is the heart of the quarter. Since it was rebuilt in 1987, it has housed a permanent exhibition on the history of the church and the Nikolaiviertel. Every Friday at 5 p.m. there is an organ concert entitled Zuhören – Entspannen – Nachdenken (listen - relax - contemplate).

Ephraimpalais and Knoblauchhaus

Don’t miss the most important sights: as well as the Nikolaikirche, these include the Ephraimpalais, a masterpiece of 18th century Berlin palace architecture. The Ephraimpalais, with its gently curved Rococo façade, belongs to the foundation that runs the city’s museums and houses exhibitions on Berlin’s history and culture.

Just as beautiful is the Baroque architecture of the Knoblauchhaus , built in 1760, whose rooms and valuable furniture provide a fascinating insight into the world of the Grand Burghers.

The Theater im Nikolaiviertel performs plays with a local colour – “Berlin brashness in the heart of town” is the motto of the theatre directly beside the Nikolaikirche. On its small stage you can see plays like Zille sein Milljöh and Der Insulaner verliert die Ruhe nicht, which tell typical Berlin stories with humour and élan.

When strolling around the Nikolaiviertel you can’t miss the bronze sculpture of St. George and the Dragon which decorates one of the area’s small squares.

Restaurants and cafés in the Nikolaiviertel

For a break from the urban bustle or just a pleasant evening out, the Nikolaiviertel has more than 20 restaurants, cafés and pubs – many of them with local dishes and the typical Berlin atmosphere.

For you, it is a place of remembrance – the Marienfelde transit camp.",,,"A story of escape and suppression - today the Erinnerungsstätte Notaufnahmelager Marienfelde is a museum and memorial. It tells the story of millions of East Germans who make their way to the Federal Republic in the West. Marienfelde is the first station in The Golden West for many refugees at the time. On historic ground, the museum displays more than 900 documents and original artefacts. Learn about adventurous escape attempts and what moved these people to flee.

The ""gateway to freedom"": a story of flight
At the end of the 1940s, more and more East Germans are already arriving in West Berlin. With little living space, migration after the war soon becomes a problem. Finally, in 1953 an emergency reception centre is established at Marienfelde. The building almost fills up within the first year. After the fall of the Wall, German citizens from the former Soviet Union arrive here, in the same way refugees from the Middle East and Africa have since 2010. At the same time, the Notaufnahmelager Marienfelde memorial is resurrected to remember escapees from the GDR.

The permanent exhibition, located in this historic building, displays escape plans and routes many took to start anew in West Germany. You begin inside the simple administration building you'll see objects left behind by refugees, such as a radio from the 1960s. Refugees' cases illustrate how little people can take with them on their departure. Newspaper reports and photo archives recall the tension and turmoil of these years. Get an impression of what it means to leave everything behind through photos, audio and video witness reports. You'll also get to know returnees and their reasons for coming back to East Germany. You will then enter a fully reconstructed refugee home. The austere interior vividly shows the spaces that refugees at that time have available to them.

More stations in the history of the GDR: Bernauer Straße border and the Tränenpalast
It's a dramatic picture: in 1961, the Berlin Wall is constructed. At Bernauer Straße, a young East German soldier drops his rifle and flees to the West. This famous image towers as a large mural at the corner of Bernauer Straße/Brunnenstraße today. An original watchtower and wall fragments recall the time of the Cold War. Video and audio stations support your tour with contemporary witness interviews and in-depth information. On the west side of Bernauer Straße, a museum houses numerous exhibits including original equipment used by the border troops of the GDR. The tragic history of the former border crossing at Friedrichstraße train station is retained in the name Tränenpalast (Palace of tears). Since 2011, it has housed the permanent exhibition ""Everyday Life During the Division of Germany"". In an area of 550m², you discover reports by contemporary Germans about their experiences. Reconstructed clearance cabins create an authentic feel at the former border as you wait to enter or exit.

It is, however, often overlooked as the greenest city in Germany. To preserve its biodiversity, much is being done. One example is the foundation of the Ökowerk Conservation Centre in 1985, on the lake Teufelssee in Grunewald. The centre maintains a 2.8 hectare natural paradise with numerous habitats, on the historic industrial site of Berlin's old waterworks. In these historic halls, you can find water-related exhibits and learn all about garden design and survival skills in workshops on site. Finally, you'll spot many animals such as grass snakes, frogs and lizards in their natural environment.

Natural oases on a historic industrial site
The starting point for all walking tours is the imposing main waterworks building. The 1872 brick plant is worth a visit in itself. Among other things, you'll discover the machine hall with historical pumps and a tank. You'll also find the library, forest hall, and a laboratory. It's not just technophiles who are fascinated by the guided tours of the waterworks. Occasionally there are even torchlit tours at night. Discover the underground water storage and filtration halls with an information centre on aquatic life. The permanent exhibition informs visitors about the water distribution systems; they show numerous experiments and have a walk-in lake. Children will love building rivers on interactive models, measure the groundwater and imitate frogs. Outside in a large pond, the croaking of frogs and the whirring of dragonflies are evidence of the vitality of the biotope. The man-made ponds have been colonised by animals. Next up are the orchards, in the heart of the centre. Among other things, you'll find an organic cottage-style garden. This organic vegetable garden is located between a clay pond and a herb garden. Here you will find mainly edible vegetables with historic roots. These sections are adjoined by the flower garden to the north of the compex. The variety of shapes, colours and scents here don't just lure people; many insects, including 120 wild bee species, are busy all year round. Finally, you visit a drywall rock garden. Here you will encounter tough plants that love both sunny and dry conditions. If you're lucky, you might even catch sight of a lizard.

Berlin",52.4995867,13.497072,Architecture,2,FALSE,Zehlendorf Forest Estate - Uncle Tom’s Cabin,Non-profit residential building meets villa district,,,"Yellow, green, blue – Bruno Taut once again used a colourful palette of colours for the Waldsiedlung.

The Waldsiedlung Zehlendorf (Zehlendorf Forest Estate), which is its official name, is located on both sides of Argentinische Allee in the district of Zehlendorf. It is also known as Onkel Toms Hütte (Uncle Tom’s Cabin), which was the name of a nearby tourist café.

The housing estate was built between 1926 and 1932 on behalf of the housing cooperative GEHAG (Gemeinnützige Heimstätten-, Spar- und Bau-Aktiengesellschaft), whose chief architect Bruno Taut previously designed the Hufeisensiedlung. He had more leeway with the Waldsiedlung Zehlendorf on the undeveloped area at the edge of Berlin, in contrast to the Carl Legien housind estate, which was being built at the same time.

High quality of living
Before the First World War, Taut was responsible for the designs of the Gartenstadt Falkenberg (Falkenberg Garden City) in Grünau (known as the “Paintbox Estate”). He incorporated different ideas into the new housing ensemble in Zehlendorf, which were inspired by the trees and character of the area: the garden city movement’s affinity with nature as well as the urban development plans of non-profit residential building.
In addition to Taut, who was responsible for the overall planning, two other well-known architects of Berlin Modernism worked on the project in the south-west of Berlin: Hugo Häring, who was part of the team for the large Siemensstadt housing estate, and Otto Rudolf Salvisberg, who was involved in the designs for the Weiße Stadt (White City).

Onkel Toms Hütte comprised over 1,900 dwellings in total, of which roughly 1,100 were apartments and 800 single-family houses. There was enough space for 15,000 people, a step forward in the fight against the housing shortage in Berlin.
The living spaces of the single-family houses were generously sized for the times: 562 of them had an area of 85 square metres, and 247 houses each had an area of 104 square metres. All of them had a tenant garden and offer a high quality of life until this day.Bringing colour into everyday life
Bruno Taut’s two-storey residential blocks are located in the north of the estate. The apartments are smaller than the single-family houses in the southern part. By applying different colours to the façades, the architect enlivened the streetscape.

Taut used this element of design for the first time in the Gartenstadt Falkenberg: it was cheap, effective, and conveyed vitality. The Waldsiedlung was to be his most colourful design since 1913, with the alternation of intensive green, yellow, and blue tones. The Zehlendorf residents soon dubbed it the “Parrot Estate”, which wasn’t always meant in a positive sense.

The architects Hugo Häring and Otto Rudolf Salvisberg designed the terraced houses. Although both pursued a different aesthetic style elsewhere, they adapted their styles more closely to those of the GEHAG chief architect.
Nevertheless, they still gave their buildings a personal touch. Salvisberg marked the boundary between two terraced houses with a layer of bricks. Häring gave his lime green painted houses coloured accents with red roof overhangs.

The work on the housing estate was already well underway when Bruno Taut designed a long row of houses along Argentinische Allee in 1930. Due to its length of 400 metres, the block of 31 housing units went down in the history of Berlin Modernism as a whip crack. The long row of houses, which was curved to match the road, is reminiscent of the designs for the Siemensstadt housing estate and the Weiße Stadt, which were created at the same time.

Garden city with a connection
The three architects were careful to incorporate the pine trees into their designs. The rows of houses were designed to constantly give an unobstructed view of the trees in the tenant gardens. The colour scheme of the façades created interesting contrasts with the green in the surrounding area, which was designed by the landscape architects Leberecht Migge and Martha Willings-Göhre.

However, the residential complex was not just intended to offer its residents the rural idyll of a garden city. With the opening of the Onkel Toms Hütte U-Bahn station in 1929, a transport connection to the centre of Berlin was established. From 1931 to 1932, Otto Rudolf Salvisberg expanded the station, which was originally designed by Alfred Grenander, by adding a striking shopping arcade along its length.

You will know them by their roofs
The new housing estate was a thorn in the side of the traditionalists. With their bright colours and flat mono-pitch roofs, the houses were quite different to the traditional ones. Added to this were social tensions: the well-heeled citizens in the villa suburb resisted the influx of people from the poorer social strata.

The housing cooperative GAGFAH (Gemeinnützige AG für Angestellten-Heimstätten) was supported by conservative Centre Party and at the end of the 1920s, commissioned its own project at the edge of the Onkel Toms Hütte housing estate: the experimental “Am Fischtal” estate. The “Heimatstil” of this design with its traditional saddle roofs was a stark contrast. This juxtaposition went down in the history of architecture as the Zehlendorf Roof War.

The housing estate survived the Second World War largely unscathed. As with other Berlin modernist residential complexes, the following decades saw a number of conversions that changed its overall architectural appearance. In the 1980s, restoration and renovation measures were initiated. Onkel Toms Hütte has been under a preservation order since 1995.

Our tips for the Onkel Toms Hütte housing estate
You can experience even more Berlin Modernism not far from the Waldsiedlung Zehlendorf, or Onkel Toms Hütte, at the Brücke-Museum (Bridge Museum), Kunsthaus Dahlem (Dahlem Art House) and Haus am Waldsee, which can be reached by public transport.

It devotes itself to young, international art which is unconventional, surprising and innovative. On the other hand, the society places art within a political framework. It is a platform for communication; reflecting social processes and stimulating new discussions. According to the working principles of the association, an annual general meeting determines the programme of the club. In addition to art exhibitions, nGbK also produces exhibition catalogues and theoretical writings.

In search of the new society: The nGbK in Kreuzberg
When the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Bildende Kunst dissolves in 1969, some of its members start the Neue Gesellschaft für bildende Kunst or nGbK. In contrast to the former Art Club, nGbK provides a counter-model, moving away from the previous hierarchical structures to common participation and self-management. Meanwhile, the nGbK belongs to the most important art associations in Germany. With more than 800 members, it is also one the largest organisations in this area. Oranienstraße in Kreuzberg is the seat of the association. It is located in a former safe factory. The social focal point finds direct reverberations in the social processes and works of the nGbK. The rooms located in the backyard are comprised of 400 square metres of exhibition space. 100 square metres are used for panel discussions, performances and other events. In direct contrast to the building, the rooms are state-of-the-art. Grey and white walls convey a cool, but not cold, atmosphere. Spaces are minimal and clear, but also stimulating, without distraction. Everything is focused on the exhibits. It is the optimal setting for contemporary art. Exhibitions are diverse in content, touching on subjects such as the future of work, migration, xenophobia, gender, media criticism and a range of critical approaches. Visit thematic group, monographic and interdisciplinary exhibitions, group projects, performances and exhibitions of digital art. You can also take part in exciting socio-critical discussions.

What makes the nGbK so special
Democratic art association.
Unconventional, young art on socially relevant topics.
Possibility of personal participation in the cultural sector as a member of the nGbK.
Modern exhibition space and meeting room (total 500 square metres).
Art education and art in the public space as further focal points of the association.

Only a few minutes' walk from Moritzplatz is a very special experience: enter IMAGO 1:1, the world's only accessible large-format camera. This is not a replica. On the contrary, here you will receive so-called IMAGOgrams - photographic black and white unique pieces in life size (62x200 cm). These single copies are a conscious alternative to the digital photo flood. The IMAGO Camera celebrates the one, magical moment. The art space Kreuzberg/Bethanien is located in the direct vicinity of the nGbK. On Mariannenplatz, this former Deaconess Hospital serves as an exhibition space today. Here you can see more contemporary art which explores social developments. The exhibitions and art projects are often accompanied by discussions, guided tours and educational programmes.

In summer, Berlin’s Olympiastadion is transformed into an open-air stage for the some of the world’s top events. The many legendary bands and musicians playing here over the past years have included such names as the Rolling Stones, Madonna, Robbie Williams, Depeche Mode and Coldplay.

Exploring the history of Berlin’s Olympiastadion
From 1934 to 1936, during the Nazi era, the old stadium on this site was demolished and a new stadium and sports complex built as the venue for the 1936 Olympic Games. Inspired by the clear geometric forms of sports’ arenas in the classical world, architect Werner March created a stadium capable of holding an audience of 100,000 people.

Today’s Maifeld is just one part of the Reichssportfeld (Imperial Sports Arena) planned by the Nazi regime as a site for propaganda events. The sports and events complex constructed for the Olympic Games also included the Waldbühne venue, designed like an ancient amphitheatre. In 1936, the Waldbühne was the site of the Olympic gymnastics competitions. Today, it has become a much-loved open-air concert venue, surrounded by green spaces.

Anyone visiting the Olympic Stadium complex is sure to visit the Glockenturm – the bell tower –, especially renowned for its amazing views. The lift whisks you to the top of the tower for a panoramic vista out across the nearby Maifeld and stadium to the city or over the Waldbühne to the woodlands beyond.

The eleventh Olympic Games took place from 1 to 16 August 1936. After 1936, another 20 major events were held at the Reichssportfeld, including the 1937 German football championship, the state reception for Mussolini and various sports festivals. At the beginning of the Second World War, the Reichssportfeld, which was partially set below ground level, was converted to a bunker, a production site for detonators, a storage area for munitions, food and wine, and a back-up radio broadcasting site.

A history trail on the Olympic site has 45 panels in English and German offering a fascinating insight into the complex’s origins and development down the years, as well as information on the historical art works from the early years of the Nazi regime.

On event-free days, you can explore the impressive stadium itself, either with an audio guide or as part of a guided tour. On live tours, you can also visit sectors normally off-limits to the public, including the locker rooms, underground warm-up halls, and the VIP areas.

The reopening
At the turn of the millennium, extensive modernisation work began while the sporting events continued. The lower ring was renovated and 13 luxury boxes were added to the upper ring. Today, the total capacity is 74,475 seats. On 1 August 2004, there was an official reopening ceremony for the Olympiastadion. Without doubt, one of the highlights in the history of the new Olympiastadion Berlin was its hosting of the 2006 World Cup Final. The German Cup Final has been held here since 1985, and it is the home stadium of Hertha BSC in the Bundesliga.
How to get to the Olympiastadion and more details
Generous parking is available on non-event days. During major concerts and sporting events, parking is limited. The stadium can also be reached quickly and conveniently by public transport on the U2 line, the S5 S-Bahn line or a number of bus lines.

Berlin",52.4965115,13.3797873,Park,2,FALSE,Park at Gleisdreieck,The Park am Gleisdreieck is located on a former railway area around the traffic junction. Now it's one of Berlin'S most popular parks.,,,"Berlin has long since been able to consider itself a metropolis with green fingers. There are many small and large recreation and leisure areas, especially in the inner-city districts. And in the future it is also intended to adhere to a healthy mixture of redevelopment and open spaces. The latest example of this urban planning concept is the recently created Park am Gleisdreieck (Gleisdreieck Park) in Kreuzberg. The railway area around the traffic junction at Gleisdreieck became a wasteland at the end of the Second World War, and developed a rich diversity of vegetation almost unnoticed. A citizens’ group was formed with the aim of ensuring a permanent existence for this unhoped-for refuge reclaimed by flora and fauna surrounded by dense redevelopment, and in the end they were successful. Many proposals and criticisms by residents were integrated into the planning process, which was notable for the strong public involvement. After its completion in 2013, the Park am Gleisdreieck connects to the green areas of the government quarter and Potsdamer Platz, and extend them in a southerly direction to the nature park at Schöneberger Südgelände. The eastern part of this park was opened in September 2011 and with its 17 hectares (42 acres) represents the larger part of the total area of 26 hectares (64 acres) that will be created between Tempelhofer Ufer and Yorckstraße. An ICE railway line cuts through this area in a north-south direction separating the two elements of the park from each other.

The park today
The park has been awarded the German Landscape Architecture Prize 2015 for produces outstanding quality in design and construction through to property and detailed planning. An essential element of the park architecture is the preservation of the ruderal flora, i.e. the proliferation, which was once prevented by the old railway installation. Some of the old signalling and railway facilities are still present in the park, giving it its own particular flair. The intercultural Rosenduftgarten (Rose Scent Garden) is especially worthwhile visiting, as it is cultivated by various neighbourhood communities and therefore a riotous mix of colours is to be expected. In contrast, there’s rather more activity going on in the nature discovery area, where city kids can really get stuck into playing in the mud and experiencing the natural environment at close quarters. There’s also a museum railway operating, continuing the distinctive motif of its railway origins. Skaters can enjoy one of the largest skating areas in the city, and there’s plenty of room for joggers, table-tennis players and yoga lovers to pursue their passions. In 2013 the western part of the park was opened, where there’ll also be plenty of open spaces for botanical and sporting activities.

A children's park
The extensive lawns provide plenty of space for a delicious picnic or impromptu ballgame. In the nature experience area children aged between 6 and 12 can also discover animals and plants, play hide and seek or, in summer, splash in the water-filled hollows. And of course there are also a number of playgrounds to be conquered by younger or older children.",,,Parks & gardens,https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/styles/visitberlin_bleed_header_visitberlin_mobile_1x/private/image/Park_am_Gleisdreieck_c_Philip_Koschel%20%287%29_DL_PPT_0.jpg?h=0c2904f9&itok=LL9dG0tL,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/park-gleisdreieck,,,,

The park bench there is not for relaxing but for taking a look at the irregularly sized granite slabs by the pathway and a painted wall that encloses the garden.

It is only a second glance that shows you that this is a memorial site – the Parliament of Trees Against Violence and War. The artist and environmental activist Ben Wagin created it on the former border strip of the Berlin Wall in 1990. A total of 58 authentic parts of the Wall were used and given an artistic treatment. The granite slabs list the names of the 258 victims of the Wall. The number of those who died at the internal German border is listed for each year from the construction of the Wall until its fall.

Mankind and nature on the former border strip
The heart of the memorial site is a square of 16 trees that were planted in 1990 by the 16 German state presidents – the Parliament of Trees. Memorial stones, testimonies of the Berlin border facilities, flower beds, pictures and texts complete the installation. It not only remembers those who died on the Wall but also examines the relationship between mankind and nature. This is illustrated by painted statements such as “The Foundation of a common European home has to be an intact environment”.

Wall memorial in Marie-Elisabeth-Lüders-Haus
The Parliament of Trees had to be marginally reduced in size for the construction of the Marie-Elisabeth-Lüders-Haus that also lies on former no man’s land. A round room in the Marie-Elisabeth-Lüders-Haus remembers the history of the location. Wagin secured parts of the Wall that follow its original route.

The Parliament of Trees is on the east bank of the Spree, opposite the Reichstag, and can be reached via Schiffbauerdamm.

From the first Caliphs in the 7th century to the 19th. You will find the collection in the Pergamon Museum on Berlin's impressive Museumsinsel (Museum Island). The Pergamon is internationally renowned as the oldest and most important museum of its kind - not least due to the imposing facade of the Palace of Mshatta, a gift from the Ottoman Sultan to the German Emperor. Smaller treasures include velvet fabrics, pottery and valuable carpets in fine patterns and bright colours. The famous Aleppo Room is decorated with original wood panelling from the year 1600.

A collection of tradition
""The Bismarck of the Berlin museums"", Wilhelm Bode establishes an Islamic Art Department in 1904. It is first housed in the Bode-Museum but is transfed to the Pergamon Museum in 1932, thereby belonging to the Berlin State Museums. The cornerstone of the collection is the Mshatta Facade - a gift from Abdul Hamid II to Kaiser Wilhelm II. Significant parts are destroyed during the war, including a tower of the Mshatta facade. In 1954, the collection is divided between West and East Berlin, and reunited in 1992. Since 2000, visitors have been able to see the full collection at the Pergamon Museum. The tour takes you chronologically through the exhibition, beginning with the great Caliph empires. Discover excavation finds from the rich city Samarra on the Tigris River. Further along you stand before the imposing stone facade of the Mschatta Palace, an 8th century residence from Jordan. The filigree reliefs are a well preserved architectural specimen. A path leads you through the 11th to 15th centuries. Discover a painted turquoise prayer niche from Anatolia and a detail of the carved dome of the Alhambra in Granada. The Aleppo Room dates from the early modern period: its ornate paintings and wood panelled walls are made for a Christian merchant.

The Luftbrückendenkmal in Tempelhof is a reminder.",,,"For 322 days, all roads to West Berlin were blocked – the only way in and out was the airlift. The Luftbrückendenkmal in Tempelhof is a reminder.
When Germany was divided, West Berlin was completely surrounded by the GDR and cut off from West Germany. The Luftbrückendenkmal at the former Tempelhof Airport commemorates the time when bombers brought food and supplies to West Berlin.
The Luftbrückendenkmal in Berlin, Frankfurt and Celle
There are three identical airlift memorials in Germany. Besides the one at Tempelhof, the airports in Celle and Frankfurt am Main also have memorials reminiscent of a hungry hand reaching up. They commemorate the days of the Berlin airlift and all those who lost their lives in it. The curved concrete structures – designed by Eduard Ludwig – have three claws facing westwards to symbolise the three air corridors and the three Allied occupying forces. The original memorial in Tempelhof was dedicated in 1951, and the replicas in Frankfurt am Main and Celle, where the bombers loaded with food and supplies took off, were unveiled in 1985 and 1988.
West Berlin as an enclave
At the end of the Second World War, the Allies occupied Germany and divided it into zones, and the capital Berlin into sectors. Berlin was surrounded by the Soviet zone, and the eastern part of the city was also held by the victorious USSR. The western part of the city was occupied by the Americans, British and French. West Berlin became an enclave. After constant disagreements with the other occupying powers, and probably in response to the unilateral currency reform, the Soviets cut off all road and river access to Berlin on 24 June 1948. The western sectors were no longer accessible by normal transport routes.
The Berlin Airlift
The unexpected isolation of West Berlin led to serious supply problems, resulting in shortages of electricity and food. The Allies had to find some way of supplying the 2.2 million civilians and the soldiers stationed in their three zones. The only access that was not blocked was the air route, so an airlift was set up to supply the inhabitants. Every two to three minutes, an aircraft landed at Tempelhof Airport. The “candy bombers” brought vital supplies from The Royal Air Force base in Celle and the Rhein-Main Air Base in Frankfurt am Main to West Berlin. After 322 days, the Berlin Blockade was finally lifted.
In 2008, regular flights to Tempelhof Airport finally ceased. Since then, the Tempelhof airfield has been an open space in the middle of Berlin where you can jog, skate, have a barbecue or just relax.",,,,https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/styles/visitberlin_bleed_header_visitberlin_mobile_1x/private/image/Platz_der_Luftbr%C3%BCcke_DL_PPT_0.jpg?h=e5aec6c8&itok=N7Gd_YLn,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/airlift-memorial,,,,

Two angels running across a large grey space, a huge empty wasteland in the city. The only thing standing in this no-man’s land is a wall. High-rise skyscrapers, bustling activity everywhere, people strolling through a shopping centre, going to the cinema and sitting in cafés. If you see the 1987 film ""Wings Of Desire"" and look at Potsdamer Platz today, it’s hard to imagine that it’s the same place.

Since reunification, what used to be a wasteland with the Berlin Wall running through it has become a completely new neighbourhood. It’s a must for anyone visiting Berlin, because there are restaurants, cinemas, theatres, shopping centres and modern architecture.

Potsdamer Platz today

The term Potsdamer Platz is an imprecise one. Actually, it’s only the square next to Leipziger Platz, but Berliners have come to refer to the whole area as Potsdamer Platz.

The Potsdamer Platz Arkaden, with their many shops, are a popular place for shopping (under renovation). You can take the fastest elevator in Europe up to the Panoramapunkt in the Kollhof Tower, where you can enjoy a fantastic view of the Berlin skyline. The LEGOLAND® Discovery Centre  with around five million Lego® bricks is great fun for all the family.

The Filmhaus in the Sony Center

Every February, Potsdamer Platz is at the centre of the Berlinale, the Berlin film festival. But that’s not the only time of year when it attracts film fans. The CinemaXX is a large multiplex cinema. At the Arsenal, art-house enthusiasts can get their fill of experimental works and cinema classics. The Museum für Film und Fernsehen offers a fascinating trip through the history of cinema and television in Germany. On the central reservation of Potsdamer Straße in front of the SonyCenter, the Boulevard der Stars commemorates great German actors.

Where the first traffic lights stood: Potsdamer Platz in the past

The square gets its name from the Potsdamer Tor, the gate that stood on the main road from Berlin to Potsdam since the 18th century. The square’s heyday was the early 20th century, when it was bustling with life and roaring traffic. In 1924, the first traffic lights in continental Europe were installed to guide the buses, trams, coaches and cars. The cultural elite met in the cafés and restaurants around the square.

The Second World War left the square devastated, and not only that, it was the point where the Soviet, British and American sectors met. It was then divided by the Wall, which meant it spent more than 40 years in neglect – a wasteland between the East and the West. The only building not destroyed by the bombs was the Weinhaus Huth in no-man’s land next to the remains of the Hotel Esplanade. At the end of the 1980s, a 1.6-kilometre stretch of maglev track was built at Potsdamer Platz.

The rebirth of Potsdamer Platz

After reunification, the unique opportunity arose to built a complete new district in the centre of the city. In 1991, the competition to design Potsdamer Platz and Leipziger Platz was won by the architects Heinz Hilmer and Christoph Sattler. The concept was based on the “European city” model, which explicitly rejected dense concentrations of high-rise buildings.

In 1993, work began on the construction of the DaimlerChrysler Quartier, based on the master plan by the architects Renzo Piano and Christoph Kohlbecker. The buildings were designed by international star architects including Renzo Piano, Richard Rogers and Arata Isozaki. In only five years, Europe’s largest building site was transformed from nothing into a new urban centre. Helmut Jahn’s Sony Center, completed in 2000, has a cool, futuristic aesthetic which contrasts with the DaimlerChrysler Quartier. In early 2004, the elegant Beisheim Center opened at the Lenné-Dreieck.

The Brandenburg Gate is one of the most iconic sights in today’s vibrant Berlin. More than just Berlin’s only surviving historical city gate, this site came to symbolise Berlin’s Cold War division into East and West – and, since the fall of the Wall, a reunified Germany. Architecturally, the sandstone Brandenburg Gate also represents one of the earliest and most attractive examples of a neo-classical building in Germany.
History – the Brandenburg Gate
Constructed between 1788 and 1791, the Brandenburg Gate was Berlin’s first Greek revival building. Designed by Carl Gotthard Langhans, architect to the Prussian court, it was inspired by the monumental gateway at the entrance to the Acropolis in Athens. The Brandenburg Gate is 26 metres high, 65.5 metres long and 11 metres deep, and supported by two rows of six Doric columns.
In 1793, the gate was crowned by the Quadriga statue, designed by Johann Gottfried Schadow. This statue also has its own story to tell. In 1806, when Napoleon’s army took Berlin, the French Emperor had the Quadriga transported to Paris as war booty and a sign of his victory. In 1814, after Napoleon’s forced abdication, the Quadriga was returned to Berlin where it once again adorned the Brandenburg Gate,  facing towards the east and the city centre.
In 1946, with the post-war division of Germany and Berlin, the Brandenburg Gate was in the Soviet sector. When the Berlin Wall went up in 1961, the Gate stood in an exclusion zone in an arc of the Wall, inaccessible for locals and visitors alike. When the Wall fell, 100,000 people gathered here for the Brandenburg Gate’s official opening on 22 December 1989 – and soon afterwards, crowds thronged the area to celebrate their first joint New Year’s Eve in this once-divided city. Today, more than almost any other of the city’s landmark sights, the Brandenburg Gate symbolises a reunited Berlin.
Architecture – Pariser Platz square
The Brandenburg Gate faces Pariser Platz, regarded as one of the city’s most attractive squares. By the end of the Second World War, the buildings around this historical square were in ruins. Reconstruction at this prime location only started in the 1990s after German reunification, and the buildings now include elegant town houses, embassies and the impressive five-star Hotel Adlon.
The Max Liebermann Haus and the Haus Sommer, set to the left and right of the Brandenburg Gate, were designed as a matching pair in a style inspired by the architecture of the Prussian master builder and court architect Friedrich August Stüler. This historic location is also home to two other prominent buildings housing the embassies of France and the United States.",,,Architecture,https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/styles/visitberlin_bleed_header_visitberlin_mobile_1x/private/image/regierungsviertel01_DL_PPT_0.jpg?h=77a3658e&itok=vNPB4omE,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/brandenburg-gate,,,,

In contrast, only in the late 1990s did the grand neo-classical Reichstag receive its own symbol of parliamentary transparency – the famous glass dome with its stunning views out across the city and into the plenary chamber itself.
History of the Chancellery
The architectural competition for the new Chancellery was won by Berlin-based architects Axel Schultes and Charlotte Frank with a spectacular award-winning design which included the surrounding complex of buildings. The Chancellery ranks as among the most impressive structures in this new government quarter, and is the largest government headquarters in the world – eight times larger than Washington’s White House.
When Germany was divided in the post-war years, Bonn became the capital of West Germany and East Berlin the capital of East Germany. In 1991, two years after the Wall fell, the Bundestag voted for Berlin as the capital of a reunited Germany – which also entailed creating a new government district in the heart of the city. Under then Chancellor Helmut Kohl (in office 1982 – 1998), a competition was announced for the new government district along the River Spree. Work started on the Chancellery in 1997 and it was finished in 2001.
The Chancellery comprises the nine storey main building, together with the two administrative wings. This complex is integrated into a 102-metre-wide ribbon of federal buildings known as the “Band des Bundes”, which forms a clasp across the Spree, linking the east and west of the long-divided city. The Chancellery’s most striking feature is the semi-circular setting for the upper glass façade. This shape, which is 18 metres high, seems to recall a washing machine door, and has led to the building being nicknamed the “washing machine”. The new Bundestag buildings also include the Paul Löbe House and Marie Elisabeth Lüders House, located at the eastern end of the complex, to the north of the Reichstag.
Glass and light
The architecture is strongly informed by the post-modern style. The Chancellery glass façades, emblematic of the transparency of modern government, appear to be structured by columns. Yet these soft contours actually belong to twelve-metre-high stelae dividing the space and creating lines of perspective where the building’s exterior and interior merge.

The Chancellor’s Office
The Chancellery houses the offices of the Chancellor with, for example, the cabinet room on the sixth floor. The main building also contains the offices of the Head of the Federal Chancellery, the Ministers of State and their closest staff. The other administrative offices are in the side wings. The main building also serves as an impressive backdrop for receiving state guests. The foyer has the dimensions of a cathedral while, with their transparent design and balconies, the Chancellor's reception floors offer wonderful views out across Tiergarten Park.
The first floor is home to all the former Chancellors of the Federal Republic of Germany – or rather, their official portraits! Many of Germany’s Chancellors commissioned major German artists to paint these works. For example, the portrait of Gerhard Schröder (in office 1998 to 2005) is by Jörg Immendorf, while Helmut Schmidt (in office 1974 to 1982) was immortalised by Bernhard Heisig.
The forecourt, where state guests are received, is also the site of the monumental iron sculpture Berlin by the Spanish artist Eduardo Chillida. The sculpture, which is over five metres high, embodies the idea of separation and union.
In the spirit of transparency which informs its architecture, the Chancellery also has an annual Open Day when the building can be visited by the general public.",,,"Government district

A short history of the Reichstag

The Reichstag is an internationally recognisable symbol of democracy and the current home of the German parliament. Every year, thousands of guests visit the Reichstag - and with good reason: It is not often that you can enjoy such an amazing panorama while, just beneath your feet, the political decisions of tomorrow are being made. Both as an architectural wonder and a historical testimony, the Reichstag has an important role to play in Berlin.


The original building is designed by Paul Wallot and modelled after the Memorial Hall in Philadelphia. Decorative motifs, sculptures and mosaics are contributed by the artist Otto Lessing. The Reichstag is completed in 1894 although it doesn’t acquire its iconic dedication to “the German People” until 1916 when the words Dem Deutschen Volke are inscribed on its façade. At the time Kaiser Wilhelm II regards the building as “the pinnacle of bad taste”.

The Reichstag serves as the home of the German parliament until 1933 when the building is badly damaged in a fire. This event marks the end of the Weimar Republic and provides a convenient pretext for Hitler to suppress dissent. Under Nazi dictatorship, the building falls into neglect and is severely damaged during the Second World War. In 1945 it becomes one of the primary targets for the Red Army due to its perceived propaganda value.

After the war, West Germany’s parliament is relocated to Bonn, and the building remains a virtual ruin until 1961 when a partial renovation is undertaken in the shadow of the newly erected Wall. Completed in 1964 this controversial restoration sees the building’s interior and exterior stripped of the majority of its statuary. However, the city makes efforts to retain the traces of its more recent history such as the bullet ridden façade and the graffiti left by the occupying Soviet soldiers.

Throughout the cold war period and until the German reunification in 1989 the Reichstag is the site of a permanent exhibition, “Questions about German History” but otherwise sees only occasional ceremonial use. In 1990 the Reichstag is the site of the official reunification ceremony. After another year of intense debate, it is decided that it will once again be the home of the German national parliament. In 1995, just prior to the commencement of Norman Foster’s restoration of the building, artist Christo and his wife Jeanne-Claude wrap the Reichstag in fabric. Foster’s careful restoration and redesign of the building is completed in 1999, and the new German government convenes at the Reichstag for the first time on April the 19th.

There is a certain irony in the fact that the building’s glass cupola is not featured in Foster’s original plans for the renovation of the Reichstag. The dome sits directly above the debating chamber. A mirrored cone at its centre directs light into the Reichstag, increasing the building’s energy efficiency and affording visitors a view of the parliamentary proceedings below. The dome itself can be visited by prior registration and is reached by two large steel ramps that curve up towards it in the form of a double helix.


Five fascinating facts about the Reichstag


        Cyrillic graffiti left by Soviet soldiers, after their siege of the Reichstag in 1945, has been carefully preserved and can be still seen by visitors today.
        A true example of eco-architecture, the Reichstag is highly self sufficient in its production of energy. The shape of the dome allows the building to make use of natural lighting and ventilation which makes the building a unique symbol of sustainability.
        The Reichstag is an important art venue. It has a considerable art collection and shows changing exhibitions as well as permanently installed artworks.
        The roof of the Reichstag is home to the Käfer Dachgarten Restaurant where guests with a prior reservation can enjoy a delicious breakfast, lunch or dinner. Free panoramic view included!
        Besides its eventful history, Berlin is known to be a casual and friendly city. See for yourself on the grass in front of the Reichstag. This is a perfect place for picnics and a popular spot for sunbathing and relaxing.


What to see nearby when you visit the Reichstag

There are a number of important Berlin landmarks situated in the immediate vicinity of the Reichstag. The main railway station, the Bundeskanzleramt and the Brandenburger Tor are all located a short walk away from the parliament building. You can also find a number of memorials nearby. These include the astounding Holocaust-Memorial by Peter Eisenman that consists of 2,711 concrete slabs arranged in a grid in which you can suddenly feel very disoriented and small. Another nearby memorial consisting of a circular pool commemorates the Sinti and Roma victims of National Socialism, whilst a concrete cube containing a video memorialises the homosexuals persecuted under Nazism.

How to get to the Reichstag using public transport

The Reichstag is easily accessible by public transport as it is situated just a short distance from Berlin’s main rail station, the Hauptbahnhof. The number 100 bus, which provides an unrivalled sightseeing opportunity along its route between the Zoo Station in the West and Alexanderplatz in the East, also stops at the Reichstag, as does the M41. The nearest U-Bahn station to the Reichstag is the Bundestag. It is the middle station of only three stations on what is surely Berlin’s shortest U-Bahn line which runs between the Hauptbahnhof and Brandenburger Tor.

But the largest and most modern residential complex was built in Haselhorst.",,,"The apartments were not intended to be aesthetically impressive, but instead to offer the best comfort for the lowest possible cost. Marie-Elisabeth Lüders, the initiator of the Reichsforschungsgesellschaft, urged: “First the kitchen – then the façade!” This also correlated with architect Paul Mebes’ approach, who designed the apartment based around the kitchen. He replaced the open-plan kitchen with a separable kitchenette to keep smells away from the other rooms. Since the architects usually had only 40 to 50 square metres at their disposal for the 2-room apartments, they had to use the space efficiently. You can get an impression of this in a museum apartment inside the Reichsforschungssiedlung: the wooden doors with handles and spyhole are just as original as the terrazzo floors in the kitchen and bathroom and the oxblood red wooden floorboards.

The architects experimented with different floor plans. The open-plan kitchen did not disappear, since there was not sufficient space for a separate kitchen area in the 1.5-room apartments. Due to financial reasons, the façades remained modest, and Fred Forbát’s framed balconies were the most striking design feature.

The Reichsforschungssiedlung was the most modern and, with 12,000 inhabitants, also the largest Berlin housing estate from the Weimar Republic period. Here people on lower incomes could afford an apartment. After all, 37 percent of the tenants were blue-collar workers – much more than in the Hufeisensiedlung, the Siemensstadt Housing Estate or the Weiße Stadt Reinickendorf [internal links]. But even in the Reichsforschungssiedlung they did not account for the majority. Half of the residents were white-collar employees and civil servants.

Dissolution of the Reichsforschungsgesellschaft
The Reichsforschungsgesellschaft had to dissolve when the National Socialists took power. Modernist buildings were continued by Gewobag until 1935. Fred Forbát had his German citizenship and work permit taken away by the National Socialists in 1933. Although the architect emigrated and survived, his parents and sister died at Auschwitz.

From 2003 to 2013, Gewobag was responsible for the restoration of the housing estate complex in keeping with its listed historical status.

Our tips for nearby the Reichsforschungssiedlung
You can get an authentic insight into life in the Reichsforschungssiedlung in the 1930s in the Museum apartment at Burscheider Weg 21.

You can discover other Modernist Berlin buildings along the U-Bahn line 7. Alight at the Siemensdamm station and explore the Siemensstadt Housing Estate. In a westerly direction it is only a short walk to the former Gewehrfabrik Haselhorst (rifle factory). A guided tour of the BMW motor factory is also well worth it.

Berlin",52.52013,13.3748199,Architecture,2,FALSE,Band des Bundes,Connecting East and West,,,"Berlin’s government buildings form a bridge over the river Spree connecting East and West. Known as the Band des Bundes – the “Federal Ribbon” – they are a fascinating mixture of modern architecture and German history.
The government buildings in the heart of Berlin form a ribbon across the river Spree, symbolically connecting East and West. The parliamentary offices and the chancellery were not built until the wall came down and Berlin was chosen as the country’s seat of government. The buildings are exciting examples of contemporary architecture that no-one sightseeing in Berlin can afford to miss.
History of the buildings
In 1991, Germany’s parliament voted to relocate from Bonn to Berlin and return to the Reichstag. The move meant that brand-new government buildings were necessary. Except for the Reichstag and the Swiss embassy, everything else in the former government quarter by the Spree had been reduced to rubble in the second world war. This meant there was plenty of space to inspire innovative architects.
Connecting East and West
The original idea for the Band des Bundes was a gesture of reunification. In a dual piece of symbolism, the government buildings and the offices for democratically elected MPs are both a physical connection and a symbolic bridge between East and West.
The biggest architectural competition ever held
They were building for democracy. Before construction began in 1995, it was preceded by the world’s biggest-ever call for projects for public buildings. 835 architects competed for the right to build Germany’s new centre of government and parliamentary offices.
The commission for the overall concept was awarded to the architects Axel Schultes and Charlotte Frank. The Paul-Löbe-Haus and Marie-Elisabeth-Lüders-Haus were designed by Stefan Braunfels. Ideas that were rejected included the originally planned square known as the Bürgerforum with cafés and shops, and the extension towards Friedrichstraße station.
The federal buildings are not just the centre of the town in geographical terms; since 2006, the striking concrete and glass buildings have been the first thing that visitors to Berlin see when they arrive at the city’s main station.

The buildings:
Bundeskanzleramt
Paul-Löbe-Haus
Marie-Elisabeth-Lüders-Haus
Bundeskanzleramt
The most striking building is the Federal Chancellery, which was built between 1997 and 2001 and designed by Berlin architects Charlotte Frank and Axel Schultes in close consultation with Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
Paul-Löbe-Haus
The Paul-Löbe-Haus is named after the former President of the Reichstag who later became the oldest MP in the first German Bundestag. It houses MPs’ offices, meeting rooms and the main visitors’ office. Especially striking is the glass facade on the west side. The building is connected to the Marie-Elisabeth-Lüders-Haus by a bridge over the Spree for those MPs who aren’t afraid of heights, and a tunnel under it for those who are.
Marie-Elisabeth-Lüders-Haus
Directly on the other side of the Spree from the Paul-Löbe-Haus is the German parliament’s centre for academic services. Opened in December 2003, it is named after the social reformer and women’s rights activist Marie Elisabeth Lüders. It houses the parliamentary library, which is one of the biggest in the world. Along the former route of the Berlin Wall there is publicly accessible memorial containing original segments of the wall as a reminder of the divided Germany.",,,"Government district

"Weg nach Reiswerder
Berlin",52.568211,13.258239,Hidden Places,2,FALSE,Reiswerder – Berlin’s island republic,"Upon hearing the words Berlin Modernism, many people first think of the UNESCO housing estates. But the largest and most modern residential complex was built in Haselhorst.",,,"Berlin at end of the 1920s: a housing shortage was rife. Tens of thousands of people were living in barracks, summerhouses and old apartments ripe for demolition. New residents were constantly moving to Berlin – they too were looking for affordable accommodation.
The newly-founded Reichsforschungsgesellschaft für Wirtschaftlichkeit im Bau- und Wohnungswesen (Reich Research Society for Economic Efficiency in Building and Housing) wanted to remedy this situation. Personalities such as the liberal member of the Reichstag and women’s rights activist Marie-Elisabeth Lüders, City Planning Councillor Martin Wagner and architects such as Walter Gropius and Bruno Taut got involved with the project.
The Reichsforschungsgesellschaft launched a competition in 1928 to build 3,000 low-cost apartments in row development style in the Haselhorst district of Spandau. But the goal was not just a housing estate. The clients wanted to study their preparation and execution in order to learn lessons for future housing projects – and this is how the unusual name Reichsforschungssiedlung came about.
However, the competition jury and the client had different ideas about the design of this Reichsforschungssiedlung. The panel of experts consisting of Martin Wagner, Otto Bartning and other representatives of New Objectivity opted for the design by Walter Gropius and Stephan Fischer, a row development with ten to twelve-storey high-rise buildings. But the property developer, housing company Gewobag, was not convinced and wanted a more affordable compromise.
In the end, various architects built the Reichsforschungssiedlung between 1930 and 1935, with most of the designs coming from Fred Forbát, Paul Mebes and Paul Emmerich. This resulted in the desired experimental character – with different construction methods and approaches. Terraced houses stood next to apartment buildings with balcony access ways and buildings made of reinforced concrete. However, the row buildings that were constructed were not high-rise buildings. They were mostly four storeys and were scattered with lateral buildings and green spaces.
Plenty of comfort at low costThe apartments were not intended to be aesthetically impressive, but instead to offer the best comfort for the lowest possible cost. Marie-Elisabeth Lüders, the initiator of the Reichsforschungsgesellschaft, urged: “First the kitchen – then the façade!” This also correlated with architect Paul Mebes’ approach, who designed the apartment based around the kitchen. He replaced the open-plan kitchen with a separable kitchenette to keep smells away from the other rooms. Since the architects usually had only 40 to 50 square metres at their disposal for the 2-room apartments, they had to use the space efficiently. You can get an impression of this in a museum apartment inside the Reichsforschungssiedlung: the wooden doors with handles and spyhole are just as original as the terrazzo floors in the kitchen and bathroom and the oxblood red wooden floorboards.

The architects experimented with different floor plans. The open-plan kitchen did not disappear, since there was not sufficient space for a separate kitchen area in the 1.5-room apartments. Due to financial reasons, the façades remained modest, and Fred Forbát’s framed balconies were the most striking design feature.

The Reichsforschungssiedlung was the most modern and, with 12,000 inhabitants, also the largest Berlin housing estate from the Weimar Republic period. Here people on lower incomes could afford an apartment. After all, 37 percent of the tenants were blue-collar workers – much more than in the Hufeisensiedlung, the Siemensstadt Housing Estate or the Weiße Stadt Reinickendorf [internal links]. But even in the Reichsforschungssiedlung they did not account for the majority. Half of the residents were white-collar employees and civil servants.

Dissolution of the Reichsforschungsgesellschaft
The Reichsforschungsgesellschaft had to dissolve when the National Socialists took power. Modernist buildings were continued by Gewobag until 1935. Fred Forbát had his German citizenship and work permit taken away by the National Socialists in 1933. Although the architect emigrated and survived, his parents and sister died at Auschwitz.

From 2003 to 2013, Gewobag was responsible for the restoration of the housing estate complex in keeping with its listed historical status.

You can get an authentic insight into life in the Reichsforschungssiedlung in the 1930s in the Museum apartment at Burscheider Weg 21.

You can discover other Modernist Berlin buildings along the U-Bahn line 7. Alight at the Siemensdamm station and explore the Siemensstadt Housing Estate. In a westerly direction it is only a short walk to the former Gewehrfabrik Haselhorst (rifle factory). A guided tour of the BMW motor factory is also well worth it.

Instead of building more tenement blocks in Kreuzberg with dark inner courtyards, he dared to put up a magnificent set of buildings with an inviting courtyard garden – come and have a look.

The inventor of the residential courtyard
He was the man who wanted to do everything differently. And he did it with some success. In the second half of the 19th century, when more and more people were coming to Berlin, the city was being taken over by tenement blocks. Town planners with an eye on profits wanted to pack as many people as possible into the smallest space. The only regulation was that the courtyard had to be at least 26 square metres. There was hardly any light or air for the many people living in these tenements.

But Riehmer was different: he wanted people to enjoy living in his buildings. So the smart master builder embarked on his life’s work. It took courage, many hours of work and a long time to build – but it was worth it. Riehmer is considered the pioneer of the residential courtyard. His masterpiece – Riehmers Hofgarten – still stands today in Kreuzberg on Yorkstraße between Großbeerenstraße and Hagelberger Straße.

Construction of the buildings
Between 1881 and 1899, Riehmer realised his dream of providing a place for quiet and pleasant urban living. On his plot bordering on three streets, he built 18 residential buildings, each 5 storeys high with a park-like interior courtyard to relax in. As was usual in those days, the larger apartments faced the street, while the smaller ones – which each however had at least three rooms – faced the courtyard. To attract well-heeled tenants, however, the exterior, or more specifically the façade, had to be just right. The building complex, which was built over a period of 20 years, is decorated by elements from Late Classical to Neo-Baroque. The gardens were also attractively set out, with a 5-metre high bronze statue by the sculptor Gerson Fehrenbach. Grand portals provided access to the park-like courtyard.

One of the hundred most important buildings in Berlin
Not even Riehmers Hofgarten was immune from the ravages of war. Its left wing was completely destroyed in the Second World War and was not rebuilt. Nevertheless, the fin-de-siècle building was listed in 1953 and the façades were restored ten years later. Today, the famous address in Kreuzberg is home to offices, medical practices, cinemas and a hotel. When his first building draft was rejected, Wilhelm Riehmer could hardly have imagined that it would become such a valuable architectural ensemble – because it is now classed as one of the hundred most important buildings in Berlin.",,,"Hidden places in Berlin

The historical buildings give you a good impression of what Berlin once looked like. The winding streets in old Rixdorf with their small shops and courtyards with vegetable and flower beds are more reminiscent of a village than a big city.

The waters of the river Spree and Lake Rummelsburg sparkle in the sun. On the north side, your eyes are drawn to the Knabenhäuser, the former orphanages in Rummelsburg. On the south side you can see the Insel der Jugend, the big wheel in the Spreepark and the spacious 
Treptower Park. This is where Berlin – and its Friedrichshain district – shows its idyllic side.  
Stralau – from a fishing island to to a waterside complex
Half a barrel of beer and a simple meal – that was the fishermen’s reward after they brought their catch to the parish priest on 24 August, St. Bartholomew's day, when fishing began again after the close season. That’s how the tradition of the Stralau fishing festival began in 1574, which 300 years later had grown to a popular festival attracting 70,000 visitors until 1873, when it was banned because of the rowdy celebrations. Since then it’s been more peaceful on the Stralau peninsula.
However, there are still plenty of water sports enthusiasts on the island. In 1830, the first competitive sailing club was founded in Stralau, and was joined by many others by the 1860s. This made Stralau and the Rummelsburger Bucht the cradle of German yachting. Dinghies still sail past today when the wind is fair.
In the late 19th century, industrial plants were built on the peninsula, including factories for carpets, bottles and palm oil, as well as breweries and boatyards. But these closed down long ago, and old industrial memorials commemorate their history. Since the turn of the millennium, Stralau has been turned into a waterside complex with offices and luxury flats.
Sights to see on the Stralau peninsula
On the riverside path you will find the island’s oldest building – the village church, consecrated in 1464, where you can admire its surviving Late Gothic stained glass. But watch out! The church steeple has been damaged several times by storms and lightning, and tilts five degrees to the side.
The palm oil storehouse was built between 1883-85 in the Historicist style. As the name suggest, the factory was used for extracting oil from palm kernels, for example to make margarine. Today, ships anchor in front of the building and anglers try their luck. The bottling plant and glass works are also reminders of Stralau’s industrial heritage.

Berlin Mitte",52.5540712,13.3461993,Architecture,2,FALSE,Schillerpark housing estate,"In Berlin’s first housing project, the architect Bruno Taut successfully put his innovative urban development ideas into practice.",,,"1924 was an important year for the development of housing construction in Berlin. Martin Wagner, who was head of town planning in Schöneberg, initiated the introduction of a real estate tax. Building owners, who had become practically debt-free due to the high level of inflation, had to pay a tax from then on. Thus the city of Greater Berlin, which had only been unified a few years before, contributed to the cost of urgently needed housing.

Work on Berlin’s first inner-city housing project began that same year. The property developer, the Berliner Spar- und Bauverein (Berlin cooperative savings and building society), chose a site in the north of the city, where 303 apartments were built here in three construction phases between 1924 and 1930.

The Schillerpark housing estate would not be the only project of this kind. At the same time, other estates were built, such as the Hufeisensiedlung (horseshoe estate) in Britz, the Weiße Stadt (white city) in Reinickendorf, and the Carl Legien and Siemensstadt estates. Together with the pre-war Gartenstadt Falkenberg (Falkenberg garden city), they all now belong to the UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the Berlin Modernism Housing Estates.

Improvement in housing conditions
The Berliner Spar- und Bauverein enlisted Bruno Taut as the architect. He had already designed the Falkenberg garden city before the First World War. Ten years had passed since then. Taut had exchanged ideas with other influential Modernist architects such as Hans Scharoun and Walter Gropius, as a result of which he thought about how to improve living conditions in large-scale housing projects. Now, in 1924, he had the opportunity to put some of his ideas into practice.
Bruno Taut experimented with floor plan typologies at the Schillerpark housing estate. In the 1920s, the perimeter block developments from the late 19th century – housing wings enclosing an inner courtyard – still predominated. This type of development resulted in a lack of light and air in the courtyards and rear buildings.
In what was a real innovation for the time, the architect of the Schillerpark estate departed from this closed style. His buildings, while also arranged parallel to the street and encircling a courtyard, were housing blocks that were open at several points and thus accessible from the street.

Flat roofs and bricks – influences from the Netherlands
In designing the buildings, Bruno Taut also followed different principles from those of the pre-war period. Instead of traditional gable roofs he used flat mono-pitched roofs for the Schillerpark estate. Ubiquitous now, there were very unusual back then.
The inspiration for the flat roofs and red brick façades came from the Netherlands, where Taut had travelled on a study trip in the early 1920s. This is why the both the room layouts and the exterior façades incorporate elements of the Amsterdam School’s architectural style.

In contrast to the “paintbox estate” of Falkenberg garden city and the Carl Legien estate, the architect did not use wall colours as an important design element for the Schillerpark estate.
The façades were primarily characterised by the spacial formation of projections, windows and recessed balconies. The façade of the row of houses on Bristolstraße was particularly rich in detail, with its reinforced concrete pillars on both sides of the entrance.
Taut used a more restrained design for other façades on the estate. Under general pressure of costs, despite the real estate tax, he followed the architectural trend for increasingly minimalistic means of expression.
With their south and south-west facing position, the apartments offered their tenants plenty of light. Each one of them had a recessed balcony, its own bathroom and from one to four-and-a-half rooms.

Construction projects using funds from the real estate tax were subject to certain conditions. No building was to be higher than three full storeys (not including the attics, as were built at Schillerpark). Also, every apartment had to have at least one room of 20 square metres. Taut observed both these specifications in the Schillerpark housing project.

Community spirit and a healthy outdoors
Because they were open to the streets, the courtyards became semi-public green, outdoor living spaces. This embedding of the surrounding environment in the residential design was an important aspect of Taut’s architecture. 
Residents could spend time in the lush courtyards, relaxing while their children played – a completely new concept at the time. The social role of outdoor living space was also important. Residents could meet up, chat to each other and build up a sense of community.

However, the community spirit at the estate did not just arise from social interactions on the apartments’ doorsteps. Bruno Taut’s concept also included a kindergarten, communal laundry rooms and a grocery store. This concept was implemented from 1930 onwards.
Not least, there was solidarity among tenants on the estate because most of them came from a similar social background. Particularly supporters and members of left-wing parties such as the SPD and the KPD lived at Schillerpark before the Second World War. One part of the estate was reserved for trade union officials, leading some to nickname it the “red bigwigs’ castle”.

When the Nazis came to power in 1933, many of the original residents had to move out. While they were sent to prison or concentration camps, tenants connected to the Nazi system moved into the Schillerpark complex. The new regime’s plan to replace Bruno Taut’s innovative architecture with traditional elements was thwarted by the outbreak of the Second World War.

New beginnings from 1951
The Schillerpark housing estate suffered major damage in the Second World War. Not until 1951 did reconstruction work begin, under the direction of Max Taut, Bruno Taut’s brother.
Hans Hoffmann, the housing association’s chief architect, expanded the estate between 1954 and 1959 with buildings between Corker Straße and Holländer Straße. The famous architect, also known today as “Glass Hoffmann”, incorporated floor-to-ceiling picture windows in the apartments. The unusually large windows created a connection between the interior and exterior spaces.

In the 1990s and 2000s, the buildings and landscape architecture on the estate were renovated and repaired.

In his new role Biesdorf Palace offers its visitors a freely accessible exhibition on the history and architecture of the building, a café bistro, and a spacious lobby with a shop.
History of the building
Biesdorf Palace is a late-classical villa that is recognisable from afar thanks to its distinctive octagonal tower. The elegant country house was built in 1868 and is the oldest work by architect Heino Schmieden to survive in Berlin. Schmieden and his partner Martin Gropius later designed the 
Martin-Gropius-Bau, the Gewandhaus in Leipzig, and numerous hospitals. Biesdorf Palace was built in an Italianate villa style for the Baron von Rüxleben on the site of a former knightly manor. It was subsequently sold several times until it came into industrialist Werner von Siemens’ possession in 1887. Siemens is considered the founder of electrical engineering. His son, Wilhelm von Siemens, had the gardens expanded.
Beautiful park and unique architecture
The public park was designed by renowned landscape architect Alfred Brodersen in the English style with a pond, a historic ice house, winding paths, rolling lawns, and a valuable inventory of old deciduous trees and conifers. The gardens are home to various protected species of song birds and bats. The gardens also contain a tea pavilion and a reading garden. The villa’s screed cement façade dyed in a reddish tone is unique among historical buildings in Berlin.
Neglect, war, and reconstruction
In 1927, the 20-room villa came into the city’s possession. Later, the villa fell into a period of neglect, culminating in a 1945 fire which destroyed the entire top floor. In 2015-2016, the palace’s top floor was finally restored and its entire interior was completely renovated and equipped with modern technology. The historic façade and the outer area of the park are also being restored. Photographs from the late 19th century served the architects as a template. The interior contains offices, meeting rooms, workshops, storage rooms, exhibition and event spaces, as well as a barrier-free access and wheelchair-accessible toilets.","Opening hours

Formally a manor houses, it now contains an exhibition on how people lived in the Gründerzeit, Germany’s late 19th century industrial expansion, and is the venue for readings and concerts. Its park is a beautiful place for a stroll and it was listed as a protected building in 1971.
The history of Schloss Britz
In 1699 the Britzke family sold their estate to the electors of Prussia for a price of 30,000 thalers. The royal chief minister Samuel von Chwalkowski replaced the half-timbered manor house with a two-storey stone building. The interior rooms were redesigned in the years following 1770 by King Friedrich II’s minister Count Ewald Friedrich von Hertzberg, who was also responsible for the beginnings of tourism at the house, establishing a library and picture gallery that attracted many visitors to Britz. In 1880, Julius Wrede converted it from the Baroque to the Neo-Renaissance style and added a tower.
After the Second World War, the manor house was used as a children’s home. It was restored in the 1980s and many items of furniture from the Historicist era were brought to the house. An permanent exhibition now features items such as a suite of walnut chairs, a grand piano and a leather wall hanging. There is also a restaurant on the site.
The Gutspark
This history of the park began in 1706 when the manor house was built. Designed as both a kitchen garden and a pleasure garden in the Baroque style, Germany’s first robinia tree was planted there in 1719. Inspired by Dutch gardens, it featured a goldfish pond, an orangery, a small wood and orchards. As the ownership of the estate changed hands, the garden gradually developed into a park, with meandering paths, exotic plants, a colonnade of lime trees, a fountain and a garden pavilion. Particularly noteworthy is the bronze copy of the famous statue of a milkmaid which the Russian sculptor Pavel Petrovich Sokolov created for the park of the Catherine Palace near St. Petersburg.
Since 1924, when it was sold to the city of Berlin, the 1.8-hectare park has no longer been under private ownership. In 1990 the park was listed as a heritage site and seven years later it won an award for its outstanding stewardship. It is also home to Berlin’s oldest ginkgo tree.

From life on the manor to modern architecture – right next to Schloss Britz is a UNESCO world heritage site. Named after its horseshoe shape, the Hufeisensiedlung was built from 1925 onwards as a social housing estate, and is clearly visible from the air.","Opening hours

When Sophie Charlotte died, just 36 years old, the palace and the area around was named Charlottenburg after her. Today, this is the largest and most magnificent palace in Berlin – a highlight for any Berlin visitor.
Charlottenburg Palace – History
Sophie Charlotte of Hanover was the younger sister of George Louis of Hanover, who succeeded to the British throne as George I. In 1684, she married Friedrich III, the Elector of Brandenburg and the then Duke of Prussia. Friedrich gave Sophie Charlotte a large estate and the village of Lietze/Lützow, at that time still outside Berlin, and this was the site of her summer palace. Completed in 1699, it was initially known as Lietzenburg Palace. Sophie Charlotte, a great lover of the arts, invited poets, philosophers, musicians and artists to join her at her “court of the muses”. Even her husband King Friedrich I could only visit if she personally invited him. After her death, Friedrich named the palace and the surrounding area Charlottenburg in her honour.
Sophie Charlotte was not the only Prussian queen to leave her mark on Charlottenburg – so did 
Queen Louise, who was much revered by the general populace. She died in 1810, and is buried in the mausoleum with her husband, Friedrich Wilhelm III, and her son. In the course of the nineteenth century, Charlottenburg Palace was gradually forgotten by the royal rulers. From 1880, it was no longer classified as a royal residence, and the grounds were opened to the public. In the Second World War, the palace was badly damaged, though it was later rebuilt.
Visiting Charlottenburg Palace
In the Neuer Flügel (New Wing), you can view the staterooms and the rococo ballroom known as the 
Goldene Galerie (Golden Gallery). The Silver Vault includes quite stunning tableware of gold, silver, glass and porcelain displayed on laid tables. Around 100 table services have survived intact, a vivid reminder of the magnificence of dining at court. The impressive display of the remaining pieces of the Prussian crown jewels, complete with the imperial insignias, as well as personal treasures, such as the elaborated designed, exquisite snuffboxes collected by Friedrich the Great, are also well worth seeing. The Porcelain Cabinet in the Old Palace - re-opened on 1st October, 2017 - offers a breathtaking collection of the finest blue-and-white porcelain decorating the entire room.
Charlottenburg Palace Park
Once Sophie Charlotte strolled through the park, celebrated lavish festivities here and enjoyed these magnificent baroque gardens. The park and grounds were designed by French landscape architect 
Siméon Godeau, a pupil of André le Nôtre, principal gardener of Louis XIV of France at Versailles – the model emulated by all court gardens across Europe in the baroque era. But the fashions in landscaping changed down the years, and Sophie Charlotte’s successors re-designed the grounds in the fashion of their day – as an English-style landscaped park. The highlights in the park are the mausoleum, the Belvedere tea house and the Neuer Pavillon, a small neo-classical house modelled on a Neapolitan villa.
The Mausoleum
Queen Louise was much loved by her subjects – and much mourned when she died in 1810, aged just 34. For the “queen of hearts” of her day, King Friedrich Wilhelm III, her husband, had a mausoleum resembling a classical temple constructed in the park. He also commissioned leading German figure sculptor Christian Daniel Rauch to carve an impressive funerary sculpture of Louise to decorate her sarcophagus. Friedrich Wilhelm married again, some fourteen years later, but since his second wife came from a low-ranking noble family, she was kept more or less removed from court life. When she died in 1873, she was buried in the closed crypt in the mausoleum under the anteroom, without a commemorative memorial and not even a memorial tablet.
The Belvedere Tea House
The entire Belvedere tea house with its view of the River Spree is actually a treasure trove of exquisite porcelain, and houses the largest collection of porcelain from the world-famous KPM porcelain producers – the Königlichen Porzellan-Manufaktur Berlin.
Belvedere
The former tea house and panoramic pavillon, built in 1788, houses an exquisite collection of porcelain objects.
A Palace Garden Café is romantically located in the small Orangery.
Look to the sky
On the dome of the palace, a golden figure of the goddess Fortuna is balancing on a sphere. She carries an outstretched cloak, making her rotate in the wind. This gilded statue dates from the twentieth century, but was inspired by the original weather vane from 1711.

The charming palace of the Glienicke Villa is set like an Italian country villa on the banks of the River Havel, evoking a Mediterranean lifestyle. Strolling through the beautiful park and grounds, looking out over the water and the magical landscape of palaces, it seems hardly credible this is not an Italian arcadia, but the outskirts of a very vibrant Berlin!
From Berlin to Potsdam via Italy
In 1823, Prince Carl of Prussia, a younger son of the Prussian king, returned home from his travels in Italy. Thrilled by the beauty of the classical world, his greatest wish was to have a Roman-style country house built on the sandy soil of the March of Brandenburg. The perfect site was soon found – the Glienicke estate on the banks of the River Havel. And with the support of 
Karl Friedrich Schinkel, probably Berlin's best known nineteenth-century architect, the Prince’s dream of a little piece of Italy between Berlin and Potsdam could become a reality.
Schinkel converted the Glienicke manor house into a neo-classical country house, and also designed the auxiliary buildings in a classicist style. Prince Carl of Prussia was a keen collector of beautiful objects, decorating his rooms with his large collection of antiquities. But when the Prince died in 1883, aged 81, his family were not interested in his dream of classical Italy. The valuable collection was scattered and the palace left to decay. After the Second World War, the old palace, now located in East Germany, was used as a sports hotel and adult education centre. Since 1995, Glienicke Palace has been restored and refurbished under the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg.
The Glienicke Villa and its grounds also belong to the UNESCO World Heritage Site inscribed as the Palaces and Parks of Potsdam and Berlin.
The palace interior
The salons and rooms in the palace are decorated in strong colours, in red, dark blue and green, creating an impressive setting for the furniture and exhibits on show. The Red Salon, the main festive reception room stretching along the front façade, is the heart of this summer palace.
The Court Gardeners’ Museum
The Court Gardeners’ Museum in Glienicke Park is the first European museum dedicated to the art of court gardeners and focuses, in particular, on the work of the Prussian court gardeners. The exhibition presents documents and objects illustrating the spectrum of horticultural work from botanical drawing and surveying to floriculture.
The park and grounds
In planning his summer palace, the Prince envisioned a unity of architecture and nature, harmoniously reflected in the buildings and grounds. To achieve this goal, Peter Joseph Lenné, Prussia’s leading landscape gardener, worked closely with Schinkel to design the park and gardens. As a result, the pleasure ground, the English-style area of grounds near the house, seems completely natural, even though it is landscaped.
The influence of neo-classical architecture is also evident throughout the park. A vine-covered pergola decorated with antique marble fragments leads to the summer palace, while one of the main ornamental features is the Lion Fountain, flanked by golden lions set on columns. In the grounds, the Casino, named after the Italian for small house, similarly has pergolas and follows an antique model. Even the little belvedere, a tea house where the Prince could observe the comings and goings on the road to Potsdam, was built in the same style. When a round pavilion nearby was added to allow the Prince to watch life on the river, the tea house and pavilion were nicknamed the Kleine and the Große Neugierde – literally, the “little curiosity” and the “large curiosity”.
Glienicke Bridge, which crosses the river directly behind the palace linking Berlin and Potsdam, can also be seen from here. During the Cold War, half of the bridge belonged to West Berlin and the other half belonged to the GDR. It became famous around the world as the place where spies were exchanged.
Restaurant Remise Glienicke
The original “Remise” was the carriage house. Now converted into a restaurant, it offers both delicious snacks and a more ambitious menu. Thanks to its romantic location, the Remise Restaurant is also much sought-after for wedding receptions.
GartenForum Glienicke
The GartenForum Glienicke regularly hosts events at Glienicke Palace on landscaping and the history and conservation of gardens and parks.

In those days, the Klein-Glienicker Kapelle lay dilapidated in no-man’s land. Now, the chapel is a shining Neo-Gothic jewel, following extensive restoration. Today the palaces and parks of Berlin and Potsdam are reunited. On the Potsdam side, the romantic Schloss Babelsberg stands on a hill.

Berlin",52.4212993,13.1147633,Architecture,2,FALSE,Peacock Island House,"Peacock Island is perfect for a romantic day out – a white fairy-tale castle and spreading parkland, complete with peacocks!",,,"Note: The castle will be renovated until 2024 and is therefore closed until then.

This island in the River Havel was settled thousands of years ago. From the Iron Age bronze bangles, bracelets and hair spirals found here, we know that people were living on the island around 2,500 years ago. In the seventeenth century, Friedrich Wilhelm, Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia, set up a glass works on the island. This was an ideal location for chemist and glass maker Johannes Kunckel to conduct his experiments into making pure and coloured glass. But when his patron died and the foundry burnt down, Kunckel found himself in some considerable difficulty. Ultimately, his search for a new employer took him to the court of Charles XI in Stockholm.

The island lay forgotten for one hundred years, until it was discovered by the pleasure-loving Friedrich Wilhelm II, King of Prussia. Even as a young crown prince, he liked the island as a venue for a clandestine rendezvous with his mistress Wilhelmine Enke, later Countess Wilhelmine von Lichtenau.

Between 1794 and 1797, Friedrich Wilhelm II had a little summer palace built on the island. Designed as a ruin in the popular Romantic style of the day, the palace was supposed to evoke a “derelict rural Roman villa”. The exterior resembles white marble, though that too belongs to the illusion – the walls are actually painted wood. The little white palace, set in a prominent clearing at the end of the island, also created a distinctive landmark – an eye-catching feature for one of the vistas from the New Garden in Potsdam. Even today, visitors and locals alike are charmed by the view of the palace’s two flanking white towers joined by a cast iron bridge set against the backdrop of trees.

Countess Wilhelmine von Lichtenau, Friedrich Wilhelm II’s mistress, designed the interior to her personal taste. Rather than following a particular style, she chose selected pieces of outstanding quality. After her death, the palace was little used by the Prussian rulers. Queen Louise, the wife of Friedrich Wilhelm III, complained about the thin walls, and preferred the comforts of Paretz Palace on a rural estate to the west of Berlin. Although many buildings in Berlin were damaged during the Second World War, the little palace on Peacock Island survived unscathed and so still remains in its original form today.

Peacock Island is now under the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation Berlin-Brandenburg. Together with Glienicke Palace and the Potsdam palace landscape, the island with its little palace is inscribed as UNESCO World Heritage.

Peacock Island Park

In 1821, the island was landscaped by Peter Joseph Lenné. One of Germany’s leading nineteenth century landscape architects, Lenné also designed many of the parks and gardens in Berlin and the environs. The delightfully landscaped grounds on Peacock Island are home to a number of other architectural features including, for example, the dairy, designed as the Gothic ruins of a monastery, the Memorial Temple for Queen Louise, and the neo-Gothic Kavaliershaus to house members of the court. In the 1960s, the Kavaliershaus, which resembles an English country house, became a popular location for filming scenes in a series of German movies based on the works of Edgar Wallace.

Apart from the eponymous peacocks, still out strutting the lawns and displaying their plumage, the island is home to a wealth of wild life from cormorants to woodpeckers and innumerable frogs. In summer, four water buffalo are kept here to help control the grass growing on the wet meadows.

Peacock Island has also been immortalised in the wonderful novel ""Pfaueninsel"" by Thomas Hettche. A great way to get in the mood for your visit!

Getting there

From the city centre, Peacock Island is easiest to reach by S-Bahn to Wannsee, and then by bus and ferry (€4 each way, reduced €3).

The island is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Since it is also a protected flora and fauna habitat, no dogs or bicycles are allowed on the island. The entire island is a no smoking area.

The wallpaper has floral patterns and animal motifs; everywhere there are portraits of famous former inhabitants; lavish showcases contain porcelain from Berlin and glass from Brandenburg; magnificent chandeliers hang from the ceilings. Schloss Friedrichsfelde shows what a luxury residence looked like in the 18th century.
In the course of its history, the palace has been a pleasure palace, a model of modern agriculture and emergency accommodation for animals, as well as a quarter for French soldiers and a prison for the deposed king of Saxony.
The start of construction in the 17th century
If you notice any similarity to nearby Schloss Köpenick, it’s because Schloss Friedrichsfelde is also the work of the architect Johann Arnold Nering. Building began here in 1695, just a few years after Schloss Köpenick was completed. The Dutchman Benjamin Raule been given the plot of land in Rosenfelde (now known as Friedrichsfelde) by Elector Friedrich Wilhelm of Brandenburg in recognition of his services as general director of the Brandenburg navy. Raule used this royal reward to build a pleasure palace in the style of a Dutch manor house.
Conversion in the 18th and 19th century
The naval director only lived in Schloss Rosenfelde for three years before he fell out of favour and the estate returned to the Hohenzollern family. In honour of Friedrich Wilhelm, who died in 1688, Schloss Rosenfelde was renamed Friedrichsfelde in 1699. In 1717, the estate was again given away as a gift – this time to Margrave Albrecht Friedrich of Brandenburg-Schwedt. He widened the palace and introduced Baroque elements such as the balustrade. The palace changed hands several times during the century, and each owner made alterations to the exterior and interior. From 1785, Peter von Biron, the Duke of Courland, redesigned the interior in the Early Neoclassical style, and the outer façade was remodelled from 1800 by Duchess Catherine of Holstein-Beck, a relation of the tsars who played host to high-ranking members of the Russian royal family at Friedrichsfelde.
After 1816: a farm, a veterinary clinic and a zoo
The palace’s time as a residence for royals and courtiers ended in 1816 when it was bought by the Treskow family. Carl von Treskow established a modern farm here based on Albrecht Thaer’s agricultural theories. In 1821 the landscape gardener Peter Joseph Lenné was called in to design the park, and his work is still recognisable today.
After the second world war, Schloss Friedrichsfelde was confiscated from the Treskow family and its rooms looted by Soviet troops. When the Tierpark zoo was established in 1955, the palace became part of it, serving as the administrative office, animal accommodation and a veterinary clinic. It was extensively renovated between 1970 and 1981 to remove the many signs of wear and tear from its various uses and restore its former glory.
Restored to its former glory
Today, the appearance of the Palace is that of an Early Neoclassical 18th century residence. Portraits of its former residents hang in the corridors and exquisite Neoclassical porcelains can be seen in display cases. Concerts are regularly held in the banqueting hall, and there is a zoological exhibition, as well as an exhibition on the history of the palace and its very different inhabitants.","Opening hours

In Pankow you will find the Schönhausen House and Estate: once the summer residence of the Prussian kings and then the seat of the East German head of state, it now houses exhibitions.",,,"A Prussian summer residence developed over the course of history to a guest house for Gandhi, Gaddafi and others. Schönhausen House in Pankow has been an important scene of politics and history. It also has a fascinating new exhibition every year.

A generous gift

The story begins when a manor house was built on the site in 1664. In the period up to 1740 many conversions took place, secret negotiations were held there and court officials lodged there. This changed when King Friedrich II – known affectionately as “Alter Fritz” – gifted it to his wife Elisabeth Christine. She spent the hot summer months there for 50 years and extended it to a Rococo palace. Its opulent rooms with stucco ceilings and brightly coloured floral carpets can still be admired today. At Schönhausen, Elisabeth Christine was really in exile, because her husband, who didn’t want her around, never paid her a visit at her beautiful summer residence.

Schönhausen House under the Nazis and in the GDR

During the Nazi era, the palace was used for exhibitions and as a place to store artworks. 780 paintings and sculptures and around 3500 works on paper by proscribed artists were stored there, some of which were shown in the “Degenerate Art” exhibition.

After the partition of Germany, the first – and only – President of the GDR, Wilhelm Pieck, used the palace as his official seat. The presidential garden is a reminder of this time. In the following years the East German State Council moved in. From 1965 to 1990 it was repurposed as a guest house for official visitors of the GDR. Those invited included Indira Gandhi, Fidel Castro, Muammar al-Gaddafi, Kim Il-sung, Leonid Ilyich Brezhnev and Mikhail Gorbachev. The building is now open to the public and features a guest room with its 1960s furnishings.

The rectangular “round table” where Germany was reunified

The “Central Round Table” set up at the end of 1989 to discuss the reform of the GDR made use of the convivial atmosphere of the casino building at the Schönhausen House. From the fourth round of negotiations in 1989 to 12 March 1990, the reunification of Germany was prepared and a constitution for a joint state drafted, but this never saw the light of day. Technically, the term “Round Table” was a misnomer: the actual table where they met, worked and discussed was rectangular. It was simply named after the democratic negotiations that had taken place in Poland, which were held at a table which actually was round.

Experience the palace with all your senses

Braille panels and audio guides allow barrier-free access for people who are blind or visually impaired to explore the palace. You can touch replica costumes to get a feel of them. There is a video guide to the palace rooms for tourists with hearing impairments. Schloss Schönhausen is an outstanding example of barrier-free sightseeing.

Berlin",52.5181534,13.3969444,Architecture,2,FALSE,"""Zeughaus""",The Zeughaus is one of the most important buildings in Berlin. It houses the Deutsches Historisches Museum. Find out all about the Zeughaus at visitBerlin.de.,,,"What was once an arsenal for weapons is now a museum. The oldest preserved building on the boulevard Unter den Linden is the city’s most important large Baroque building. Today, the pale pink building houses the Deutsches Historisches Museum (DHM) and gives you an insight into 1500 years of German history.
The history of the Zeughaus
The construction of the Zeughaus ran into problems right from the start. In 1667, Elector Friedrich Wilhelm of Brandenburg proclaimed in his will that a building for the military be constructed, but a lack of funds in cash-struck Prussia prevented this at first. Not until 1695 did Elector Friedrich III start building the arsenal – an armoury – naturally inspired by the Sun King’s magnificent Versailles.
The first chief architect was Johann Arnold Nering, who built the palace in Charlottenburg. When he died, Martin Grünberg took over the construction and Andreas Schlüter assumed overall responsibility. The building work took years, with lack of money, changing architects and poor building materials constantly delaying its completion.
In 1875 the arsenal was converted into a “pantheon to the glory of the Prussian army”, a war and weapons museum. After severe wartime damage, the interior of the building was completely redesigned during the restoration between 1949 and 1965. In 1952, the Zeughaus became the Museum for Deutsche Geschichte, and was renamed the Deutsches Historisches Museum in 1990. After extensive restoration, since 2006 it has housed the permanent exhibition German History in Images and Artefacts.
The architecture: Baroque pomp and classical simplicity
The building has four wings, each 90 metres long, surrounding an inner courtyard (Schlüterhof). Its overall appearance is characterised by the harmony between the strict, Neoclassical façade segmentation and the richly decorated Baroque relief sculptures. Your eyes are drawn to the twelve large groups of figures on the roof.
The courtyard
The courtyard holds a surprise – in a building dedicated to the art of war hang the 22 “Heads of Dying Warriors” by Andreas Schlüter. Faces distorted by pain and suffering show a different, more truthful representation of war than the victorious gods of war. The Elector approved it anyway – probably because they were supposed to be the heads of enemies.
The extension
In May 2003, the extension opened, designed by the Chinese-American star architect I.M. Pei, who had already designed the pyramid for the Louvre. The elegant sandstone and glass building fits in harmoniously with the surrounding historic buildings and it houses the temporary exhibitions of the 
Deutsches Historisches Museum.
Zeughauskino
The east wing of the building contains the Zeughauskino. The arthouse cinema, which was renovated in 2004, shows series of films on cinema history – which often include less known films that are worth discovering. Why not take a look?
Café im Zeughaus
Next to the cinema there is a pleasant café to relax in between visiting the museum and strolling down the boulevard Unter den Linden.
Art market at the Zeughaus
Every Saturday and Sunday on the east side of the Zeughaus, you can wander through a market with art and crafts. The stalls with their exquisite displays are very popular with Berliners.",,,,https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/styles/visitberlin_bleed_header_visitberlin_mobile_1x/private/image/Schlossbr%C3%BCcke_09_c_marco_fragasso_DL_PPT_0.jpg?h=0c2904f9&itok=ifEEdMj5,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/zeughaus,,,,

The Köpenicker District Sports Association also uses the idyllic green space. The shore of the Dahme serves as a base for hiking, with a beer garden and snack bar in the summer and cosy hostelries during winter.

Between snacks and butterflies
The Schmetterlingshorst opens its doors in 1898 as a restaurant with a twist. The Czech entomologist and master glass engraver Johannes Bittner exhibits his moth collection in an anteroom. After the building sustains damage during the Second World War, reconstruction begins in 1947. The new tenant also runs a restaurant, and this rustic hostelry becomes a popular excursion destination during the GDR. When it subsequently threatens to fall, once again, into decline, the building undergoes a full restoration by the District Sports Association Treptow Köpenick e.V. Today, the Schmetterlingshorst has become, once again, what it once was: a beloved garden in the countryside. Under the shady canopy of tall trees, you can enjoy a hearty meal and refreshing drink. Since 2007, you can again admire the butterflies and insects, and learn about the fascinating world of arthropods as you explore 80 cases displaying more than 4,000 specimens. Herbert Jacobs bequeathed the ground floor collection in 1952. The cases are arranged so you can view the exhibits close up. You'll see many of the innumerable butterflies, which come in all shapes and sizes, for the first time. Scientists stationed throughout the collection provide fascinating insights into the world of entomology. Art lovers can also take excursions into nature here: painters and photographers regularly exhibit in the butterfly rooms.

The Shell-Haus takes its name from the oil company of the same name. In the late 1920s, its German subsidiary Rhenania-Ossag Mineralölwerke AG needed a new office building in Berlin. And they wanted it to make an impression on the cityscape.
The competition was won by Emil Fahrenkamp. Actually, the architect was not someone noted for unusual concepts. He was in his mid-40s, a professor at the Düsseldorf Academy of Art and, above all, conservative in his designs. But the Shell-Haus that was built between 1930 and 1932 turned out to be his masterpiece.
Not too smooth
The Shell-Haus was unique in its form, construction and materials. Fahrenkamp created the dynamics of a wave – with a series of undulating projections along its windowed façade, adding another storey each time. Its rounded corners and windows enhanced the wave effect.
To create this unusual form, the architect used a state-of-the-art construction method. The six- to ten-storey Shell-Haus was one of the first steel-framed high-rise buildings in Berlin. The external cladding was made of travertine, a pale limestone from a quarry near Rome. Fahrenkamp also used high-quality materials for its windows, with frames made of steel and bronze.
To protect the Shell-Haus from the vibrations caused by increasing road traffic, the civil engineer Gerhard Mensch designed a special reinforced concrete tank for the steel frame to rest on. It extended far below ground level and its side walls were separated by a gap from the components above. In this way, hardly any vibrations penetrated the building with its trapezoidal ground plan.
Although the Shell-Haus was stylistically reminiscent of New Objectivity, Fahrenkamp didn’t completely put the function of the building before its form. The curves of the elegantly undulating façade made some of the floor plans of the offices rather impractical.
An expensive legacy
During the fierce fighting in the final days of the Second World War, the upper storeys were badly damaged. After the war, the Shell Group sold the derelict building to Bewag, the West Berlin electricity board, which repaired all the damage and moved its headquarters into the building.
The Shell-Haus became a listed building in 1958, and was painstakingly refurbished in the 1990s. To replace the damaged travertine on the exterior façade, the owners even had work resume at the long-closed quarry near Rome.
In 2000, Bewag sold the newly renovated Shell-Haus to a real estate company. Since then, the building in the Tiergarten district has had various tenants. First it was the headquarters of the Berlin gas supplier GASAG and since 2012 it has been an office of the Federal Ministry of Defence.",,,"Industrial Architecture

Juni leads west through the centre of Tiergarten Park. If you stroll down it for around twenty minutes, you reach a major intersection – a vast roundabout known as the Großer Stern. And right at the heart of the roundabout, you can find the Victory Column.

Incidentally, in 2008 this was where Barack Obama gave a speech in the year before he was elected President of the United States.

History of the Victory Column

Work on the column began in 1864. Designed by Heinrich Strack, the column was initially intended to celebrate Prussia’s victory in the Second Schleswig War against Denmark that same year. By the time the column was finished in 1873, Prussia was also celebrating victories in the Austro-Prussian War in 1866, and the Franco-Prussian War from 1870 to 1871. In the wake of those military successes, the Kingdom of Prussia successfully united Germany as an imperial power under the Prussian crown. The Wars of German Unification, as these three wars are known in Germany today, were originally commemorated by a column of three segments topped with a bronze sculpture. The bronze reliefs and mosaic frieze decorating the columned plinth also recount the story of founding the German Empire.

The Victory Column first stood on Königsplatz square (today Platz der Republik, in front of the Reichstag Parliament building). In 1938–39, under Hitler’s plans to transform Berlin into his world capital Germania, the column was moved just over 1.5 km to the west to its present location. At the same time, a fourth section was added, raising the column to a height of 67 metres. The Victory Column survived the Second World War largely unscathed. In the mid-1980s, it was then restored and is now listed as a heritage site

The sculpture

The bronze sculpture at the top of the column weighs 35 tons and measures 8 metres and 30 centimetres. Created by Friedrich Drake, this figure represents Victoria, the goddess of victory, the Roman equivalent of the Greek goddess Nike. She is holding a laurel wreath in one hand and, in the other, a spear as a military standard, decorated with an iron cross set in a wreath. Since her helmet is adorned by an eagle, the goddess can also be read as symbolising Borussia, the personification of Prussia. Locals, though, have a less respectful nickname for this gilded bronze statue and call it the Goldelse, the “Golden Elsie”.

A panoramic view

The Victory Column’s viewing platform is set directly below the figure of the goddess – at the top of a spiral staircase of 285 steps. With the staircase narrowing as its approaches the top, this climb requires a reasonable level of fitness and is nothing for the faint hearted.

But the view from around 51 metres up is well worth it! From here, you can enjoy panoramic views across the spreading Tiergarten Park and much of the city. And since the viewing platform is open nearly all year round, this is the ideal spot to enjoy the city with all your senses – with the wind in your hair and Berlin at your feet!

As the first high-rise factory in Europe, the Schaltwerk Hochhaus is now an important example of the Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) style of building: the structure of the façade is created by the rows of windows alone and there are no perimeter block developments or imposing elements. In the 1920s, people loved to see the windows light up at night as they combined with the dark contours of the buildings to become a symbol of the ""Electropolis"".

Berlin",52.5168701,13.3891908,Attractions,1,FALSE,Unter den Linden,"From the Berlin Cathedral to the Brandenburg Gate, and many other landmarks in between – the magnificent boulevard Unter den Linden takes you right through the middle of Berlin.",,,"Unter den Linden is one of the most important arterial roads in the centre of Berlin and is the ideal starting point for getting to know the city. The magnificent boulevard in Mitte is the venerable heart of Berlin and takes you from the Brandenburg Gate to the Schlossbrücke and the new Humboldt Forum. Strolling along the 1.5 km long road, you pass numerous important buildings such as the Humboldt University and the Staatsoper, and landmarks such as the Neue Wache and the Zeughaus. The boulevard also boasts restaurants, cafés and shops.

The history of the boulevard Unter den Linden

The street, known commonly as die Linden (after the lime trees that once lined it) is the oldest boulevard in Berlin, but originally it was nothing more than a bridle path. From 1573, it led from the Stadtschloss to Lietzow, which was later renamed Charlottenburg after Queen Sophie Charlotte, and then on to Spandau. The first lime trees were planted in 1647. After 1701, as royal power grew, the road was continually improved and impressive new architecture was built. This was the work of Frederick the Great, who had it upgraded to a magnificent boulevard. That’s why there is an equestrian statue of “der Alte Fritz” at the eastern end of the street.  

The buildings that sprang up along Unter den Linden over the years included the Zeughaus, the Friedrichstadt and, under Frederick the Great, the Kronprinzenpalais, the Prinzessinnenpalais, the Opernhaus and the Palace for Prince Heinrich, which is now the Humboldt University. Karl Friedrich Schinkel ensured that the different buildings and architectural styles fitted into a harmonious aesthetic concept. Thus, the Neue Wache and the Schlossbrücke were built and the Lustgarten redesigned, turning the boulevard into a complete ensemble. In the late 19th century, the Berliner Dom was rebuilt in the eclectic style of the Wilhelmine era.

After the Second World War, Unter den Linden was little more than a wasteland of rubble – except for the Stadtschloss. But in 1950 Walter Ulbricht, the General Secretary of East Germany’s ruling party, decided to demolish the Stadtschloss. As a symbol of Prussian absolutism it was a thorn in his eye. The other still extant buildings were gradually rebuilt, but the real construction work began in 1958, when typical 1960s buildings with identical façades started to go up. In place of the Stadtschloss, the Palast der Republik was built. After reunification it was found to be contaminated with asbestos and had to be pulled down.

Unter den Linden today

Since reunification, many buildings have been restored and rebuilt. The Lustgarten – which was used as a parade ground by the GDR – became a garden again, just as Lenné’s original plans intended. Just opposite, the Humboldt Forum opened in 2020: State-of-the-art interactive exhibitions await you on an area of around 30,000 square metres and spread over five floors.

Berlin",52.5158527,13.4072399,Museum,2,TRUE,Museum Ephraim-Palais | Stadtmuseum Berlin,"Art and culture in the ""most beautiful corner of Berlin""",,,"Not far from the Museum Island, the Ephraim Palace shines in a proud rococo setting. The ""most beautiful corner of Berlin"" is one of the most magnificent town houses in the capital. The gently rounded corner façade with gilded balcony lattice and Tuscan columns is an eye-catcher. Currently, however, the four-storey gem in the Nikolai quarter is closed until autumn 2021. The historic building has to be renovated.

A journey into the 18th century
The building has an eventful history. It is completed in 1766 by the architect Friedrich Wilhelm Diterichs for the affluent Veitel-Heine Ephraim, jeweller to the Prussian Court and Mint Master. In Nazi Germany, the palace, which is part of the Jewish history of Berlin, undergoes building works. It is adapted to be a base for regional management and other National Socialist administration. Miraculously, the façade and other parts of this beautiful building survive the war. After the Berlin wall is built, the West Berlin Senate plan to use parts of the Ephraim-Palais for the Berlin Museum.

However, since the blueprints are located in East Berlin, the plan never comes to pass. In the 1980s, when both sides of Berlin are preparing to celebrate the city's 750-year anniversary, the palace gives up some building components, and in return receives the archive of the Royal Porcelain Factory from the East Berlin municipal authorities. Between 1985 and 1987 the palace is rebuilt following its original blueprints in the newly developed Nikolaiviertel (or Nicholas' Quarter). The interior is based on the Rococo elements of the façade, and is designed in a more simplified form. The eye-catcher is the spiral staircase: from above, you might believe it is a gigantic shell. The richly decorated ceiling designed by Andreas Schlüter on the first floor is another wonder. The palace, with its tasteful rooms, breathes with the spirit of the time and is the perfect location to explore the alternating exhibitions art and culture in Berlin.

So much to marvel at in Nicholas' Quarter
A stone’s throw from the Ephraim-Palais, you'll find the two towers of the Nikolaikirche (St. Nicholas' Church). The oldest church in Berlin, it rises over the district. In 2010 the church is fully restored, but parts date back to the 13th century. Today it is a museum. A walk through the mighty hall will take you through the permanent exhibition; ""From the Base of the City to the Double Spire."" At interactive media stations you will discover the history of the church and the birth of Berlin. On Fridays, enjoy the weekly organ concerts – the acoustics in the church are excellent for such an event. Right next to the church, you can experience the everyday life of the Biedermeier era in the Knoblauchhaus. The imposing three-storey Rococo building dates from the 18th century and is the former home of the Knoblauch merchant family. On the second floor, multiple photographs, images, everyday objects and copies of letters tell their story.

The Hemp Museum, the only one of its kind in Germany, is just around the corner. Visit to discover the agriculture, industry and legal history of hemp, a product which can be used for building insulation, textile manufacturing and paper production. In ancient China, hemp was reported to cure malaria and rheumatism. A few steps from the Ephraim-Palais is the Zille Museum, where you can view the work of popular painter and photographer Heinrich Zille. A true Berliner, Zille's paintings often portray the working class of the city around 1900 with a sharp sense of humour. In the Direktorenhaus Museum, artists and designers from all over the world present their multi-faceted work. This building is just 200 metres from the Ephraim-Palais and is located in the old Royal Mint.

Berlin",52.5132307,13.3302198,Memorial,1,FALSE,Soviet Memorial Tiergarten,A memorial to more than 2000 Red Army soldiers,,,"A place of remembrance in the centre of Berlin: the Soviet War Memorial on Straße des 17. Juni commemorates the fallen soldiers.

The Brandenburg Gate is top of everyone’s list of sights to see in Berlin, and the Reichstag is also bound to be on it. Between them on Straße des 17. Juni you can stop and see an important piece of Berlin’s history at the Soviet War Memorial in the Tiergarten.

It is estimated that 80,000 Soviet troops lost their lives in 1945 fighting to take Berlin. There are three memorials in the city to commemorate them: one in Treptower Park, one in Schönholzer Heide and this one in Tiergarten. The Soviet War Memorial in Tiergarten was the first to be built and was dedicated on 11 November 1945. The site was designed by the sculptors Lev Kerbel und Vladimir Tsigal and the architect Nikolai Sergiyevski.

The design of the Soviet War Memorial in Tiergarten
You enter the war memorial via its main entrance on Straße des 17. Juni. It is symmetrically laid out, flanked on the left and right by two Soviet T-34 tanks that were the first to reach Berlin. Diagonally behind them are two artillery guns recalling the battle for Berlin. Their salvoes marked the victory over the Nazis. At the centre of the memorial are colonnades bearing the names of the fallen soldiers. The large Russian inscription is translated as “Eternal glory to heroes who fell in battle with the German fascist invaders for the freedom and independence of the Soviet Union. 1941–1945”.

The highest pillar at the centre of the colonnades bears an eight-metre-tall statue of a Red Army soldier. His rifle is slung over his shoulder to signify that the war is over. He holds his left hand over the graves of more than 2000 soldiers. The cemetery is a green lawn behind the colonnades.

The six-hectare site is not the only memorial in and around the Tiergarten. The Holocaust Memorial, the memorial to homosexuals persecuted by the Nazis and the memorial to the Sinti and Roma victims of the Holocaust are all close by and together form a moving reminder of the dark side of Berlin’s history.

Berlin",52.5402771,13.2117834,Museum,2,TRUE,Zitadelle Berlin,"Berlin’s Spandau Citadel, the impressive Zitadelle Renaissance fortress, has a chequered history – from military fortress to cultural and concert venue.",,,"Spandau Citadel, the Zitadelle Renaissance fortress, is just ten minutes’ walk from Spandau’s old town. Today, the old sixteenth-century Citadel hosts a wealth of cultural events – from medieval festivals and banquets, to concerts, plays and performances.

Yesterday: An impenetrable fortress
As you enter the impressive fortress, it’s easy to imagine the sounds of the past – the neighing of horses and shouts of the medieval knights. In these walls, the Renaissance era truly comes alive! The Citadel was constructed in the sixteenth century to protect the city of Berlin. As a defensive fortress, it was designed symmetrically with four bastions connected by four walls of equal length, leaving no blind spots for attackers to hide. The four bastions are called Queen (Königin), King (König), Crown Prince (Kronprinz) and Brandenburg.

The site originally held a thirteenth-century castle. Since the surviving Julius Turm tower was part of that complex, it is now Berlin’s oldest building – and at 34.6 metres high, it is still Spandau’s signature sight. The Julius Turm is open to the public, and the top level offers truly stunning views across Spandau and the River Havel.

The Spandau Citadel is one of the best preserved Renaissance fortresses in all of Europe – and strolling across the grounds inside, history seems to come alive!

Today: A modern cultural centre
Yesterday’s military fortress has become today’s cultural centre – with exhibitions, festivals, concerts, puppet theatre, the popular bat cellar and exhibition, as well as medieval and jousting festivals.

The Spandau Citadel was first opened to the public in 1989. Since then it has hosted a wide range of events – from theatre to international pop music. Museum and tours
Even if the Citadel fortress is only just over a mere four hundred years old – the fortress site has many stories to tell from the last 1000 years. A Slavic settlement excavated by archaeologists dates from around 1050, the oldest traces of human life here.

To find out more about the site, you can visit the Citadel’s varied exhibitions. The west curtain wall shows the remains of a Slavic wall and the later stone castle, while the Commander’s House focuses specifically on the history of the fortress. The Archeological Window offers an insight into the middle ages, and showcases medieval Jewish gravestones thought to have been taken from the Jewish cemetery as building materials. The new setting for the display from late 2015 now allows visitors a closer view of the exhibits.

The regular tours on offer provide a fascinating introduction to the fortress and site. On Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays from March to October, there are three tours a day to choose from (in German). Some tours are offered in English and other languages, and a multilingual audio guide is always available.

But the Citadel is not only about history – it is also a magnet for bat experts and fans! Every year, the fortress provides a winter home to around ten thousand bats. Not surprisingly, one absolute visitor highlight – especially for children – is the vaulted bat cellar, where you can see around 200 flying fox bats. The cellar exhibition is also dedicated to these winter guests. The cellar is open every day, and you can register in advance for one of the popular guided ‘bat tours’ through the vaulted corridors.

In addition to the permanent exhibitions, there are changing exhibitions covering a wide range of topics. From art galleries to exhibitions on historically significant events, the love for details can be felt in every corner of the citadel.

Citadel Music Festival
Every year in summer, the Citadel hosts major national and international names at the Citadel Music Festival, which regularly attracts up to 10,000 fans. Against the backdrop of the illuminated fortress complex, the festival has a very special atmosphere – and this unusual setting only adds to the thrills of the music.

During the festival, the Citadel also holds a lively night market with artisan stalls offer a wide range of goods and bargains.","Opening hours

Today’s Lindenufer dates back to 1880 when the first linden trees were planted, and then in 1892 Lange Mauergasse and Garten-Gässchen were added. In summer 2016, the once-lost urban history of important places will be made accessible to wheelchairs along this green boulevard.
The former cobblestones, a deterrent for any cyclist, have now made way for a four-metre wide paved path with plenty of room for walkers, cyclists and skaters. By the way, cycling fans can hop on their bikes and cycle the 380-kilometre long Havel circular which begins at the source of the Havel in Mecklenburg and runs through Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Berlin, Brandenburg and Saxony-Anhalt, ending at the mouth of the river Elbe. But you are unlikely to see that many cyclists at Lindenufer. The promenade is a quiet path that draws visitors from Spandau’s marketplace to »Altstadt-steg« and directly to Lindenufer. A raised vantage point overlooking the Havel is being built at the end of the bridge and offers a view of the mouth  of the Spree. If you look across to the other side of the Havel, you can see Stresow and a number of disused industrial plants that create a rather nostalgic and melancholic atmosphere.
Before Altstadt-Steg reaches the river Havel, it crosses through a pretty playground that looks very much like a river and floodplain landscape. Children have great fun climbing and balancing on the playground elements built to look like fishing nets, fish traps and river mussels. Past the playground, a memorial shaped like a split stone and a bright column commemorates Spandau’s association synagogue that was built close to here in 1895. It was  destroyed by a fire that was deliberately lit in the Night of Broken Glass from 9  to 10 November 1938. Inside the memorial, an eternal flame is lit as a sign of remembrance. Bearing the words »Everyone has a name«, a name wall remembers the Jewish citizens of Spandau who were deported and murdered during Nazi rule.
Next to the memorial is a lawn where visitors can relax and idly watch the water flowing by. Now we move to Juliusturmbrücke; the underpass beneath this bridge has been transformed into an exciting activity trail with different bubble-like hills made of plastic and steel.
At the southern end of Lindenufer, a batardeau, a structure to regulate water levels, dates back to 1842 and is a reminder of the former fortification of Spandau’s historic town district. Just a short distance from here, Lindensteg leads us to Stabholzgarten. This name recalls the salt barrels (previously referred to in German as »stabholz«) which the Royal Salt Office stored here up until 1749. This garden-like park has been welcoming visitors since 2006 with a spacious lawn, shady trees,  roses and other flowering plants as well as many benchese.

And in its lakeside and woodland surroundings, it’s not just a place for aristocrats to enjoy after hunting. Take a look for yourself at Jagdschloss Grunewald.
The “Jagdschloss Zum Grünen Wald”
In what is now the borough of Steglitz-Zehlendorf, directly by the lake called Grunewaldsee, Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg set up a hunting lodge, and his mistress lived there permanently for several years. In 1542, work began on the “Jagdschloss Zum Grünen Wald”. The water castle in the early Renaissance style was designed by the master builder Caspar Theiss. Over the years, it lost its character as a water castle as the moats were filled and the lake was lowered. The main building was constructed on two storeys with tower-like corner wings facing the lake. A relief sculpture of a stag decorates the entrance, showing that the palace is a hunting lodge.
Modernisation of the palace
The palace was not converted to a baroque building until 1699 under Gran Elector Friedrich Wilhelm. King Friedrich I of Prussia had the façade painted a brilliant white, and also added many baroque elements between 1705 and 1708: decorated stucco ceilings and fireplaces to keep warm in winter. The doors and windows were also modernised and an additional storey built.
Under Frederick the Great and his successor Friedrich Wilhelm II, the palace became less significant, as the Hohenzollerns were not keen hunters. Around 1800, it was given the name it still has today. Not until the 1820s did regular hunting events revive the lodge and the surrounding area. But everyone was talking about it after 1891, when Kaiser Wilhelm II turned it into a pleasure palace.
Exhibitions at Jagdschloss Grunewald
In keeping with the spirit of the Renaissance, Elector Joachim II commissioned portraits, passion scenes and paintings from the renowned artist Lucas Cranach the Elder, and later his son, Lucas Cranach the Younger. Jagdschloss Grunewald now has a permanent exhibition with the works of these important painters. Another exhibition features portraits of the rulers of Brandenburg and Prussia, and many historical royal hunting trophies.
The lodge and its grounds have been the location for many well-known films and series, including

A cemetery full of real-life stories – the fight against diseases, the struggle for tolerance and resistance against dictatorship. The Alter St. Matthäus-Kirchhof has many tales to tell.

History of the cemetery
On 25 March 1856, the cemetery of the church of St. Matthew was consecrated the prosperous Tiergarten neighbourhood also known as the Geheimratsviertel. The area was home to merchants, artists, administrators and of course Geheimrate, the highest officials of the royal court. The area was almost completely destroyed in the Second World War, and today the church is among the buildings of the Kulturforum, including the Neue Nationalgalerie, the Staatsbibliothek and the Philharmonie.
Ornate 19th-century tombs and 50 graves of honour for distinguished figures can be found at the churchyard in Schöneberg, bearing witness to the cemetery’s rich cultural heritage.

Graves of famous figures
The Alter St. Matthäus Kirchhof contains the graves of the brothers Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm. The two fairytale writers are buried next to each other and you can recognise them by their modest, plain gravestones.
Rio Reiser, sometimes known as the King of Germany after his hit song König von Deutschland, is also buried at the cemetery, after his grave was moved here. A slab on the ground marks his grave, and fans often leave photos, flowers, crowns and other tributes there.

The grave of the physician and hygienist Rudolf Virchow, who became famous for his theory of cellular pathology, can also be found at the cemetery, as can that of May Ayim, the Afro-German poet and activist.

Memorials
A memorial stone recalls Claus von Stauffenberg and the other members of the plot to assassinate Hitler on 20 July 1944. They were first buried in the cemetery, but Heinrich Himmler had their bodies exhumed and burnt, and their ashes scattered anonymously on a sewage farm
Another place of burial and remembrance is the “denk mal positHIV” for people who have died of AIDS.

Garten der Sternenkinder
Sternenkinder – star children – is a loving name for miscarried or stillborn children. This is a place where parents can grieve and remember them.

Gründerzeit mausoleums
You must take a look at the lavishly designed and decorated mausoleums and tombs from the Gründerzeit – the rise of German industrialism in the late 19th century. Many rich citizens were laid to rest here at the cemetery. The tomb of the von Hansemann family and the Renaissance-inspired grave of Carl Hofmann are particularly interesting testimonials of the era.

Café finovo
The cemetery is intended as a meeting-place, and the lovingly furnished Café finovo is ideal for this.

It was designed and constructed between 1923 and 1925, making it one of the first estates to be built in the Neues Bauen style in Berlin.
Instrumental ensemble on the outskirts of the city
The architect Erwin Gutkind was commissioned to design it in 1923. Until the early 1920s, he had been working as the head of department for estate and urban planning at the Prussian Ministry for Social Welfare where he published works on Neues Bauen. His writings dealt with the design of houses on the outskirts of large cities, among other things.
In 1922, one year before he was awarded the contract for the estate in Staaken, Gutkind wrote:
“In [the suburban estates around Berlin] the key note of the mass and the sequence should barely be heard. The houses are earthbound in their basic form and layout, but not inhibited. The individual houses should not stand in rural isolation but be joined together to form groups”.
The architect thus designed the estate, which was his first project in Berlin, as a sequence of 21 semi-detached houses, plus a free-standing model house.
Neues Bauen in Staaken
The houses were designed according to the principles of Neues Bauen. Flat roofs, clear lines, and geometric basic forms determined their appearance. Gutkind achieved interesting effects by 
combining cube-shaped building parts of different heights: an ancillary building was assigned to each main building, which created the striking staggered façade.
Gutkind’s serial design, which involved repeating the same basic design 21 times over, was unusual at the time. He completed the project quickly and cost-effectively by using prefabricated parts.
The façades had a horizontal structure: the lower part of the houses was plastered in white and the upper half was clad with clinker bricks. Gutkind later used this material mix for other Berlin buildings, such as the Ollenhauerstrasse residential complex in Reinickendorf or the Sonnenhof complex in Lichtenberg.
Since the bricks used for the Staaken estate were not weather-resistant, most residents covered them with a layer of plaster a few years after they moved in. Today, the brick layer has not been preserved on any of the houses.
Over the decades, they also made structural changes to the windows, doors and façades of the houses. Erwin Gutkind’s envisaged appearance of the estate is hardly recognisable these days. The residential complex in Staaken has been under a preservation order since 1992.",,,Grand Tour of Berlin Modernism,https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/styles/visitberlin_bleed_header_visitberlin_mobile_1x/private/image/Staaken_4_Simon_final_bearbeitet_CMYK_DL_PPT_0.jpg?h=06f6671c&itok=ysqvei-L,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/staaken-low-rise-estate,,,,

Berlin",52.5377364,13.410289,Architecture,2,FALSE,Stadtbad Oderberger Straße,"At the beginning of the 20th century, swimming pools were not just for swimming. Visitors went to wash and shower.",,,"Bathrooms were a luxury in times of the German Empire. In 1910, only ten percent of Berliners were able to shower or bath in their own homes, which was not only a lack of comfort, but also a danger to hygiene.

Ludwig Hoffmann, head of the municipal planning and building control office of Berlin, provided an answer to the rapidly growing population of the imperial capital with the construction of four municipal baths. Between 1899 and 1902, one of them was built in Oderberger Straße in Prenzlauer Berg.

Hoffmann's design was characterised by a rational organisation of the building. Right behind the entrance area, bathers would find cash desk and waiting areas for washing facilities on both sides. Separate stairwells led to the ladies' and men's changing rooms. The 63 showers and bathtubs were located in the side wings. Here, too, Hoffmann paid attention to state-of-the-art technology: the partition walls between the washing cubicles ended three centimetres above the floor – this facilitated ventilation and cleaning.

The largest part of the municipal baths was taken up by the indoor swimming pool, extending over three floors. Here, too, the building was well thought-out: instead of skylights, highlights on the side walls ensured pleasant lighting. The roof construction also prevented moisture on the ceiling.

The swimming pool itself, on the other hand, still reveals to this day that swimming in the municipal baths was only one possibility besides bathing and showering: measuring just 20 by 12 metres, not a great many visitors can be active in the pool at the same time.

Functionality in a wasteful outer shell
The fact that the Prenzlauer Berg municipal baths are purposefully designed only becomes apparent to the observer at second glance, as numerous decorative elements take attention away from this. Ludwig Hoffmann, who chose an Italian Renaissance façade for the Kreuzberg municipal baths, lent the building on Oderberger Strasse the appearance of a German Renaissance palace. High saddle roofs and roof superstructures with gables reinforce this historic design approach.

The Renaissance-style entrance is also reminiscent of historic town hall portals. Only a relief above the portal points out the actual significance of the building: water nixies bathing a bear.

The historicist stylistic elements are also continued inside. Here Hoffmann opted for a church look: a vault arches over the three-storey indoor swimming pool, while galleries and arcades adorn the sides of the hall. Arched windows frame the highlights and heighten the sacred feel.

The sculptor Otto Lessing provided both the façade and the interior spaces with numerous sculptures dedicated to the theme of water.

""Yes, yes, Hoffmann, we have all done him a disservice!""1 This is what the architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe is alleged to have said about Ludwig Hoffmann in 1956, who at that time had almost been forgotten.

For 28 years – from 1896 to 1924 – Hoffmann was head of the municipal planning and building control office of Berlin and oversaw the construction of a total of 300 public buildings during this time. Among the most famous are the Märkisches Museum and the Virchow Hospital. But the young Modernist architects did not hold Hoffmann in high regard. They criticised his traditionalist style and were relieved when Martin Wagner, a progressive urban planner, became the head of the office in 1926.

Hoffmann's construction survived the Second World War. The roof and windows were broken, but the building was spared any worse damage. In the GDR, swimmers used the indoor swimming pool once more. However, in 1986 cracks in the pool became noticeable and the authorities closed the municipal baths.

The bathing facility on Oderberger Straße had been closed for three decades. Only in 2016 did this change. Private operators renovated the indoor swimming pool in line with its listed status and today run the building as Hotel Oderberger. The Berlin Landesdenkmalamt (State Monument Office) awarded them the Ferdinand-von-Quast Medal 2017.

Heinrich Zille is not just ""brush-Heinrich"", as Berliners fondly refer to him, but a keenly observing journalist of the Berlin lower class, or ""Milljöh"" of the imperial age. He documents human misery, and is the mouthpiece of the social losers of that era: the ""children of the street"", according to the title of his famous picture book. Zille gives a voice to the scorned; the labourers, drinkers, little crooks and whores. Like no other, he packs his social and critical observations with humorous drawings and stories. The Zille Museum presents Zille and his work in all creative periods.

Located in the historic buildings of the Nikolaiviertel, once a showcase for the GDR, is the Zille Museum. From the outside it looks like a small shop. Through the narrow passageway, you can go straight to the museum shop which sells postcards and books. You then go into the museum with its surprisingly wide rooms. Bright walls, solid parquet and muted lighting make the museum look like a picture gallery. In contrasting images, Zille's simple motifs are from everyday life in Berlin; you will see drifters all around the Wannseestrand, dancing women, a pregnant woman holding two children in her arms. Over 150 exhibits of painters, graphic artists and photographers are presented here: milieu studies, portrait sketches and nudes - ""doodles"", as Zille calls them. They are pinned to the walls or lie open in glass cases. There is a lot to be found in the cabinet titled ""Erotic of the Master"". Zille writes and draws under the pseudonym W. Pfeifer in the collection titled ""Surgery"", which the censors of 1921 promptly forbid. You will see excerpts of this work, including pornography from the turn of the century. Take a look into the cinema room. Here you can enjoy excerpts from the film ""Det war Zille sein Milljöh"" (1980). They show unique recordings of the artist and his Berlin. Below are interesting self portraits of Zille.

People needed housing, but it was about much more than that. The Cold War had Berlin in its grip, dividing the city into east and west. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) wanted to prove something: that the GDR had more to offer the working class than the capitalist West – not just simple apartments, but real palaces!
And the newly constructed buildings were indeed luxurious: instead of being cold, cramped and lacking hygiene, they had flats with a floor space of up to 145 square meters, with lifts, rubbish chutes, stucco ceilings, parquet floors, double glazing, doorbell systems, hot water and central heating.
But the buildings were not just meant to convey the feeling of a palace, they also had a representative function, proclaiming the supremacy of socialism.
Showcase project of the GDR
Between Frankfurter Tor and Strausberger Platz, on the street renamed Stalinallee in 1949, work on Berlin’s first major socialist prestige building project began in 1952. The thoroughfare was made unusually wide – no coincidence, because the streets of the city centre had to have enough space for civilian and military parades. The prototype was the Weberwiese tower block built in 1951/52. 
The chief architect of the new Stalinallee, Hermann Henselmann, set the standard for the street: well-equipped on the inside and with decorative façades on the outside.
Schinkel and classicism as a benchmark
The architects were inspired by the socialist realism and socialist classicism of the Soviet Union. Even before the Second World War, the cultural policy of the USSR had put an end to the sober, functional architecture that was characteristic of the Russian avant-garde. Schinkel and 19th-century neo-classicism were the model for the GDR, and the residential buildings designed by the architect Arkady Mordvinov in Moscow in the 1930s were the benchmark for Stalinallee. Because of its monumental ornamentation, critics ridiculed socialist classicism, calling it the wedding-cake style.
Propaganda instead of integration
On 3 February 1952, prime minister Otto Grotewohl laid the foundation stone and work started. Thousands of construction workers, including numerous volunteer helpers, put up the first brick buildings on Stalinallee. Initially, there was great enthusiasm, and many hoped to get one of the coveted apartments. The SED left nothing to chance: newspapers and posters constantly celebrated the buildings of Stalinallee. Since November 1951, people had been hearing about the reconstruction plans in the cinemas and on the radio. A film called “The New Apartment” featured the “Reconstruction Waltz”, which was often played on the radio:
Weit wie der Himmel, hell wie die Sonne schön / baun wir Häuser, schnell solln die Kräne sich drehn / Wir rufen: Hau ruck! Hau ruck! / Wir packen zu, und die Häuser erblühn / Hau ruck! Hau ruck! Für unser junges Berlin!
[High as the sky, bright as the beautiful sun / We’ll keep on building as long as the tower cranes run / We’ll call out: Heave ho! Heave ho! We’ll get stuck in, and up the buildings will go / Heave ho! Heave ho! For our new Berlin!]
But despite the propaganda, there was general dissatisfaction with the economic and political situation in the GDR. In 1952 alone, 182,000 people left the country for the West. The death of Stalin on 5 March 1953 initially changed little. To speed up the development of the GDR, the SED politburo decided in May 1953 to raise labour targets by ten percent. This decision was the last straw. People protested throughout the country, demanding not only economic improvements but also free elections and an end to SED rule.
The people’s uprising
In Berlin, workers on Block 40 of Stalinallee learned on 16 June 1953 that their colleagues building the new hospital in Friedrichshain had written a resolution against the increased labour targets. They downed tools in solidarity and marched down Stalinallee. Soon, they numbered 2,000 workers, and by the time they reached the House of Ministries on Leipziger Straße, the crowd had swelled to 10,000 people.
The rest is history: news of the demonstration spread and the protests escalated on 17 June 1953. The government reacted helplessly and Soviet troops crushed the uprising within a few hours.
The end of ornamentation
Henselmann continued construction on Stalinallee until 1958, by which time De-Stalinisation was also beginning to affect architecture. The Stalin memorial was removed, and the avenue received its current name, Karl-Marx-Allee, in 1961. The “wedding-cake” style was considered outdated. For the second construction phase between Strausberger Platz and Alexanderplatz, the authorities decided on a complete shift in building policy. Cultural buildings such as the Kosmos and International cinemas and the Café Moskau were built in a functional style using industrial pre-production based on prefabricated residential building types.
The flats in the former Stalinallee were still in demand, but deterioration soon set in. They became less comfortable, water pipes rusted, windows became draughty and roofs leaked. They had been put up too fast using poor quality materials in the rush to create a grand boulevard. Even in the 1950s, ceramic tiles were starting to come loose from the outer façade. By 1989, half of them had fallen off, leaving bare masonry behind, some of which the municipal housing authority concealed with temporary plastic panels.
In a historical irony, it was the end of the GDR which finally slowed down the Karl-Marx-Allee’s decay. Today the buildings on the street are listed as protected historical structures. The nearly 2,600 apartments were fully renovated in the 1990s, but this had its price: the former workers’ palaces were sold to private property funds.",,,Grand Tour of Berlin Modernism,https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/styles/visitberlin_bleed_header_visitberlin_mobile_1x/private/image/Strausberger%20Platz_c_Scholvien.%28633%29_DL_PPT_0.jpg?h=2854da88&itok=_PG1ucIB,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/stalinallee,,,,

",,,"Before the Second World War, Berlin has nearly 100 exhibitions about technological development. The Deutsches Technikmuseum in Kreuzberg follows this tradition. With an area of 26,500 square metres, it is one of the biggest technological museums in Europe. Here, on the site of the old Anhalter freight yard at Gleisdreieck, you can expect exciting interactive exhibits across various fields, including transport and communication technology. Here you can explore the exciting history of ships, fighter planes and steam locomotives.
Between ""Raisin Bombers"", ""old aunts"" and Tropfenwagen cars
The Deutsch Technikmuseum opens its doors in 1983 as a ""Museum for Transport and Technology"". In 2003 the Museum receives a futuristic new building and modern makeover. A Douglas C-47B Skytrain ""Raisin Bomber"" dating from 1948-9 perches above the entrance. There is also a loading area for the former Anhalter freight depot, located on the grounds of the Deutsches Technikmuseum. This is where you'll find the ""Museum of the Future"", the new main building. This area allows for further exploration into the burning issues surrounding man and machine, and the rapid advancement of technology. Additionally, visit the Science Centre with its array of fascinating experiments involving electricity, magnets and bizarre light effects. In the engine shed, you'll find steam locomotives and everything relating to rail travel - for example, classic rail uniforms. Take in no fewer than 40 historical rail vehicles, including the opulent salon car of the last German Emperor.
Naturally, there are also detailed models to admire, including that of the old Anhalter railway station. Among the exhibited aircrafts is the good old ""Tante Ju"" (Aunt Ju), the famous propeller plane
 produced between 1932 and 1952. The maritime history department of the museum features 1,500 exhibits from the last 10,000 years. Marvel at a 33-metre long cargo ship from 1840. At that time, this majestic craft ran between the Elbe and Vistula rivers. Another popular feature is the 
Museum's Ship Simulator, where you can captain your ship safely into port. Car lovers will enjoy a collection ranging from horse-drawn carriages to the steam car and rotary engine. There is also an original Rumpler Tropfenwagen, built between 1921 and 1925. There are only two known specimens of this quirky, streamlined vehicle left in the world. Take a stroll through the museum park, with its brewery and numerous mills.

Botanist Franz Späth called this garden home during the 19th century. At that time, as well as today, the park is a recreational space consisting of stately old trees, elaborate and attractive stone architecture and a large pond. However, the park is also used for research: since 1961 the arboretum has belonged to the Institute of Biology at Humboldt University.
A green oasis in the heart of the city
Franz Späth is a gardener, botanist and tree nursery owner during the 19th century, and thus it is not surprising that the design of his garden is important to him. He creates the arboretum in 1879 and uses it to display his tree nursery. The architect is garden director Johann Heinrich Gustav Meyer, and the arboretum becomes a park in the style of English landscape gardens. Over the years, many prominent visitors plant trees here, including Reichskanzler Otto Fürst von Bismarck who picks up the spade in 1884. Since 1961, when Humboldt University takes over, research and teaching becomes an important aspect of the facility. In 1966 the park is opened to the public. Today the Späth-Arboretum covers a total area of 3.5 hectares and is divided into 32 sections. Directly at the entrance is Späth’s stately home covered with climbing ivy. From here, visitors walk along winding paths to the large pond where reeds and sedges grow, providing a beautiful photography opportunity. The oldest tree in the park is a Whitebeam, dating back to 1880. Dotted among the trees, you will discover sculptures including Robert Metzke's ""Young Girl"", and there is an attractive rock garden complete with mountain plants to visit. As you walk around, you can discover more information about plant classification on display boards, as well as beds with medicinal and spice plants. The park also hosts popular concerts at the beginning and end of each season.

Berlin's botanical gardens
Around 12 km west of the Späth-Arboretum lies Berlin’s botanical garden in Berlin-Lichterfelde. Here are specimens from almost all vegetation zones on Earth including plants from the Alps, Asia and the tropical rainforests. Exotic plants in the Great Tropical House include palm trees, giant bamboo, bromeliads and fig trees. The Botanische Garten is the largest in Germany with some 22,000 species of plants. The Botanische Museum showcases the history of botany and details the internal structure of plants. The Blankenfelde-Pankow Botanical Park is located to the north of Berlin. There are about 6,000 species of plants here, many of which are endangered. The 31-metre-wide Geological Wall consists of more than 100 types of German rock. The park also includes fallow deer and an apiary. Café Mint's team invite you to relax in the old greenhouse.","Opening hours

The former Tempelhof airport is now a public park – and not for the first time in its history. Originally the Tempelhofer Feld was a parade ground. At the weekends and on public holidays, as soon as the military cleared the site, the locals would swarm in their thousands to Tempelhof to enjoy their leisure time. Whole families would come with their baskets full of food, deckchairs and sunshades to have picnics there. At the beginning of the 1920s, Tempelhof airport was built on the site. After the airport closed in 2008, the city of Berlin reclaimed the 386-hectare open space and one of the world's largest buildings in a central location for public use. Today, the area has a six-kilometre cycling, skating and jogging trail, a 2.5-hectare BBQ area, a dog-walking field covering around four hectares and an enormous picnic area for all visitors.
The three entrances (Columbiadamm, Tempelhofer Damm and Oderstrasse) are open from sunrise to sunset.

Dogs can also romp to their heart's content - without disturbing other visitors. Three fenced-in dog runs ensure that animals and humans won't get in each other's way. You can marvel at even more urban nature in the urban gardening section, where residents and others grow lettuce, carrots and tomatoes on raised beds.
Around Tempelhofer Feld
Without doubt, the vast Tempelhofer Feld is the highlight of the district, but there’s plenty going on in the streets all around it.

Enjoy a fantastic view of Berlin from Teufelsberg!",,,"Look to the east and see the TV Tower and cathedral sparling in the setting sun. 114 metres up on a hill of rubble, the view of Germany’s capital is uniquely beautiful. Teufelsberg played the role of its life in the drama known as the Cold War – as an American listening station.
Up on the slopes
In the early 20th century the area was covered in bogs and mud, but that all changed when the Nazis came to power. As part of the plans for Germania – Hitler’s vision for a completely renewed Berlin – work began on the construction of a university faculty for military technology, but it was never completed, and destroyed in the war. After the war, trucks brought rubble from the rest of the devastated city to the site near Heerstraße and it soon piled up to become the highest point in West Berlin. The dumping stopped in 1972, trees were planted to make the man-made hill more attractive, and a ski slope was built complete with a ski lift, a ski jump and a toboggan run.
The NSA era before the whistleblowers
The Americans also soon recognised the usefulness of the artificial hill. From the 1950s onwards, antennas and radomes were erected on its two hilltops for espionage and intercepting communications. Huge dishes were built for intercepting, listening to and jamming radio signals from the Eastern Bloc.The field station was used by the American forces until the end of the Cold War in 1989. The four striking radomes are what still gives Teufelsberg its mysterious aura today, because not until 2020 when the archives are opened will the public be able to find out find out what was listened to, and what methods were used.
After the end of the Cold War and the departure of the allied forces, the complex was used for air traffic control until 1999, when the city government sold it. However, all the plans for a new use came to nothing. In 2007, the American film director David Lynch wanted to buy the complex in in order to set up a “Vedic Peace University” with the controversial Maharishi Foundation.
Today, tours are available where you can view the remains of the complex with its five large radar domes. The listening station is now probably the most well-known of Berlin’s formerly secret sites. The ruins of the station and its satellite dishes are covered in graffiti and exude a morbid charm. You can still feel the spirit of the Cold War which once permeated the city.
Guided Tours
On the Teufelsberg there is the opportunity for all visitors to open up terrain and accessible parts of the building in various guided tours. An approximately 90-minute historical tour is offered as well as a flashlight hike or a quiet ascent. In addition, private tours can be booked. Further information can be found on the Teufelsberg website.
The viewing platform of the former radar station may not be entered at the moment.
Since reunification, Teufelsberg has become a popular destination for day-trippers. In winter it’s the perfect place for tobogganing and mass snowball fights. In summer, Berliners gather here to have a picnic and enjoy the beautiful sunset – as well as the nearby Teufelssee. All year round, people fly kites and go paragliding, mountain-biking and hiking in the Grunewald forest. Sailing boats glide over the Havel in summer. The Havelhöhenweg, the footpath along the Havel, goes all the way to the Wannsee open-air lido in Zehlendorf and affords beautiful views of the river and lakes.","Opening hours (additional information)

Fast forward into the present day, and the Tieranatomisches Theater now holds exhibitions and events with the animal world still taking centre stage. Themes range from animal anatomy to human’s use of animals in day-to-day life, and at the same time, the impressive auditorium serves as a stage for the most recently applied science. Humboldt University students are invited to showcase their research findings, and the museum also works with artists, film-makers and institutions to create modern exhibitions, events and lectures. Impressive acoustics have even led the venue management team to organise concerts and recitals in the theatre.


The Tieranatomisches Theater: a theatre of applied science

This 18th century neoclassical gem exudes the charm of the leafy area it resides in. Having been built for research purposes in the control of animal diseases and then being used for the training of veterinarians, the venue is renovated in 2012 and re-opened to the public. Today, the Hermann von Helmholtz Zentrum für Kulturtechnik works with artists, students and institutions in presenting special exhibitions. Expounding on the idea that science should be available to all, a tour of the Tieranatomisches Theater begins in the entrance hall and continues through many rooms, each of which is packed with animal skeletons, photographs and other artefacts pertaining to natural history and science. The permanent exhibition, ""Das Tieranatomische Theater – Architecture and Science History"" gives you an exciting insight into the 200-year history of the auditorium. Guided tours, cinematic experiences and listening pieces make for an interactive visit, and there are regular public lectures and events. To sit in the amphitheatre with its white-painted rows of wooden seats all pointing towards the lectern, is to sit within a piece of history. Berlin’s oldest academic facility boasts a domed roof which towers overhead, covered in paintings of humans and animals.

Berlin",52.4641082,13.3266426,Architecture,2,FALSE,Titania-Palast,The Titania-Palast is one of the few remaining Berlin cinemas from the glamorous early days of sound film.,,,"Berlin during the Golden Twenties. The metropolis beckoned and people flocked to the cinemas. In 1927/28, at the transition from the era of silent films to sound films, a picture palace was built in Steglitz, whose luxurious furnishings made going to the cinema a truly special experience.
Austere form and sophisticated light architecture
The architects Ernst Schöffler, Carlo Schloenbach and Carl Jacobi designed the exterior of the Titania-Palast with the striking forms of New Objectivity. Typical of 1920s architecture is the
 assembly of several cube-shaped structures. The simple façades were divided by horizontal wall strips, crossed by narrow, vertical windows, while in the lower third, these were framed by round arches. In 1928, the architecture critic Leo Adler mocked the ""confusion of the outer appearance"".
The most unusual feature of the building is the approximately 30-metre-high tower at the corner of the building. Its descriptions range from ""steamer chimney"" to ""ladder to heaven"".
At night, the building transformed and revealed the aspect that Schöffler, Schloenbach and Jacobi wanted to focus on in the Titania-Palast: the light architecture. The electric light, symbol of the pulsating city of Berlin, was used in different ways. 27 opal glass light strips turned the corner tower into a light tower at night, making the cinema visible from afar. The cinema name TITANIA PALAST was mounted in neon tubes, while the announcements for the films above the entrance also lit up.
Even Leo Adler, who otherwise did not have much good to say about the building, stressed appreciatively:
""In the use of modern lighting technology, the Titania-Palast in Steglitz can for the time being indeed be described as a crowning achievement.""
Luxury and organic elements
As a result of reconstruction in the 1950s and 1960s, nothing has remained of the interior of the Titania-Palast. In January 1928, when the cinema opened with the screening of the silent film Der Sprung ins Glück (The Leap into Happiness), the film stars and premiere guests were surprised by the contrast between the austere, functional exterior of the building and the luxuriously furnished cinema hall inside.
A large Art Deco foyer, walls covered with red velour and gilded elements conveyed exclusivity. Intended to hold around 2,000 audience members, the hall was designed in soft, organically flowing forms: a round light dome on the ceiling, curved walls and shell-shaped arches around the screen transported the audience in those days to a temple of the modern medium of film.
Cultural significance of the Titania-Palast
From its opening until the post-war period, the Titania-Palast was more than just a cinema: it became an important cultural centre in Steglitz. Before the Second World War, theatre performances were held here in addition to film screenings. In October 1929, the first sound film flickered onto the screen. The cinema was even designed to accommodate an orchestra of up to 60 people. Not least for this reason, in May 1945 it provided the venue for the Berlin Philharmonic's first post-war concert. And on December 4, 1948, the founding ceremony of the Freie Universität Berlin took place in the Titania-Palast.
After the reconstruction of the sixties, retail stores rented the rooms for several decades. In the mid-1990s, plans were drawn up for conversion and renewed use as a cinema, and in 1995 the first film screening in 30 years took place. Today's cinema has seven projection halls and the only things it has in common with the Titania-Palast of the 1920s are the façade and the name.

Immediately after the construction of the Berlin Wall, the GDR erected the check-in hall at Friedrichstraße railway station in 1962. It was used for passengers crossing from East to West Berlin. The glass and steel pavilion was very much in keeping with the architecture of the era.
Only passengers who wished to travel to West Berlin on the S-Bahn or U-Bahn could access the Tränenpalast. Policemen checked passports and visas, customs officers checked luggage and finally passports were checked thoroughly once more before onward travel was permitted.

At the boundary between Mitte and Kreuzberg, you'll find one of Berlin's most important modern art collections. The Berlinische Galerie tells the story of modern art from 1840 onwards and puts on hot-ticket temporary exhibitions by Berlin's fiendishly productive artists. Works encompass all media from photography to painting, installation to architecture, and digital artworks. Dada and the Eastern European avant-garde are the main focus of the museum. You can also learn about the history of art in the once divided and now re-united German capital.
History and atmosphere of the museum
The Berlinische Galerie's collection is founded in the Berlin district of Charlottenburg in 1975, but the collection migrates many times during its history. From 1978 onwards it forms part of the New National Gallery, before becoming the 'Gallery of the 20th Century' at Bahnhof Zoo. In 1986, it moves to nearby Martin-Gropius-Bau. Its final resting place is commissioned following its re-designation as a public collection in 1994, and is completed in 2004. The current museum is located on Alte Jakobstraße at the end of a trail of open-air artworks that comprise the ongoing exhibition Kunst - Stadt - Raum. Directly outside the museum entrance are several rows of letters in yellow boxes. Try to discover the names of the famous artists! Experience 4,100 square metres of art stretching from Classical Modernism through to the most contemporary installations, encompassing the Expressionist, Dada and New Objectivity movements. Architecturally speaking, the museum is easy on the eye. Its central space is a former industrial hall and is now radiant in luminous white. Two striking sets of free-standing steps traverse the space, connecting the permanent exhibition upstairs with the temporary exhibitions on the ground floor. The gallery offers new perspectives on contemporary art, re-contextualizing artworks such as Georg Baselitz's 2007 A Modern Painter (Remix). Above you floats a painter, amid a proliferation of brushstrokes, with a tangle of roots beneath. Or is it supposed to be an inverted tree? As a major gallery partner, the artist uses his works to turn perceptions of contemporary art on their head.

The path carries on past lovingly kept houseboats and then the view opens up to the Stralau peninsula, the Insel der Jugend and the people relaxing in pedal boats on the river.
Treptower Park is the perfect place for a day out. In 84 hectares of greenery you can stroll along the riverside path, across sunny lawns, past the rose garden and along the shady avenues of plane trees. When it was opened in 1888, Treptower Park was a novelty for the time, a public park open to all the city’s inhabitants. Gustav Meyer, a pupil of Lenné, designed the park in the English style.
From pleasure boats to seaplanes
Walking, jogging, cycling – whatever pace you like to keep up, Treptower Park has the right routes for you. The riverboat jetty is a good place to start your tour of the green idyll. Slightly further on is the 
Insel der Jugend, a small island that you can reach by crossing an old bridge called the Abteibrücke, where you can hire a pedal boat, a rowing boat or even a barbecue boat. Just before you get to Plänterwald, you can take a break at the Klipper, a restaurant on a sailing ship where you can enjoy some cake or a smoked fish. This is also where the red seaplane takes off in summer, offering an aerial view of Treptower Park and Berlin. If you’re on a bike, carry on along the riverbank past Plänterwald and the former Spreepark amusement park to the ferry. This takes you to the other side of the Spree, where the cycle path carries on towards Müggelsee.
Things to see in Treptower Park
If instead of starting off along the riverside path you cross the street called Alt-Treptow, you first come to a huge grass area for playing and sunbathing. In the middle of the park is the Soviet War Memorial, which was built after the second world and is a cemetery for 5000 Soviet soldiers. Right next to it is the Archenhold Sternwarte, an observatory with the world’s longest refracting telescope, where you can take part in night-time stargazing away from the city’s light pollution.
Not far from the observatory and the war memorial is what used to be the Spreepark amusement park, where you can still see the big Ferris wheel. The former funfair is now being converted for a new cultural use. There are guided tours of the mysterious, closed site at weekends.
Charming old buildings and riverside paths: the Alt-Treptow neighbourhood
Alt-Treptow is changing from an insider tip to a popular residential area – especially for families.

The memorials are not just places of remembrance, but also military cemeteries. 7000 soldiers of the Red Army are buried in Treptow alone.

Berlin",52.5126765,13.4111807,Architecture,2,FALSE,Märkisches Museum underground station,Art below ground,,,"In 1896, Berlin began building elevated and underground railways, and by 1903 29 million passengers were using the new transport routes.

In the 19th century, Germany became one of the leading industrial nations, and the commercial use of electricity offered great economic potential.

But Berlin wanted more than just a functioning metro system, more than just tracks and stations. It demanded an artistic design for its transport network. This required an architect with a vision, and the city found him in the shape of Alfred Grenander.

Grenander was a Swede, but the focus of his work was in Berlin. He found a common architectural language for all the underground stations he designed here. When you walk through the station at Märkisches Museum, you’ll notice the coloured tiles. Grenander used them to cover the walls, and used different colours to indicate the different lines. At the same time, he gave each station an individual look – and Märkisches Museum station was no exception.

Built close to the water
At the turn of the century, Spittelmarkt was located right in the middle of Berlin’s city centre. In 1908, underground trains began running from there to Potsdamer Platz and to Charlottenburg, which was still a separate town. Berlin’s city councillors wanted an extension to the east – to Alexanderplatz and to Schönhauser Allee. The challenge was to build a transport line close to the river Spree without water getting into the underground tunnels. This was most difficult of all at the station then known as Inselbrücke, which later became Märkisches Museum.

Grenander found a solution by dropping the station more than six metres below street level. This depth opened up new possibilities: there was no need for steel girders to hold up the ceiling, and Grenander used the additional depth to install a basket arch vault that needed no girders. The only other structure like this in Berlin is at Platz der Luftbrücke U-Bahn station.

The building work took two years to complete. On 1 July 1913, the first underground train travelled from Spittelmarkt via Inselbrücke and Klosterstraße [internal link] to Alexanderplatz.

Into obscurity
The station didn’t get its present name until 1935, when it was renamed after the nearby Märkisches Museum, which showcases the history of the city of Berlin.

Grenander’s construction was very nearly completely lost. In the final days of the war, German and Soviet troops even fought in the underground railway tunnels and in May 1945, German units flooded Märkisches Museum station.

However, it was back in business astonishingly quickly, with the first post-war trains running on 31 June 1945. When the Allies divided up the city, the underground railway was not affected at first.

This changed when the Berlin Wall went up in 1961. For 28 years, Märkisches Museum station was on a little-used side route. Travel to West Berlin was prohibited. Not until 1993 was the entire route of the U2 line from Ruhleben to Pankow restored.

Today, the station at Märkisches Museum has been fully refurbished and restored to its former glory. Look out for Grenander’s stylistic elements: the green-framed billboards on the side walls, the specially-made tiles that replicate the originals, the oval station signs and the wooden benches.

Our tips for nearby Märkisches Museum U-Bahn station
Whatever you do, don’t miss a visit to the Märkisches Museum. There are also other sites of Berlin Modernism nearby. Two stops down the U2 is Alexanderplatz, where Karl-Marx-Allee begins. This monumental boulevard features icons of GDR architecture such as the Haus des Lehrers, Kino International or the “workers’ palace” apartment blocks on Stalinallee [internal link], now known as Karl-Marx-Allee, between Strausberger Platz and Frankfurter Tor. Another sight near Märkisches Museum station, on the other side of the Spree, is the historical heart of Berlin, the Nikolaiviertel, which was restored in the 1980s.",,,Grand Tour of Berlin Modernism,https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/styles/visitberlin_bleed_header_visitberlin_mobile_1x/private/image/U_Bhf_MaerkischesMuseum_299726_c_visitBerlin_Foto_Angela_Kroell_DL_PPT_0.jpg?h=2f83cd36&itok=Nze8-3U0,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/markisches-museum-underground-station,,,,

Between clinker buildings and chimneys, dancers perform exciting choreographies and performances. Whole festivals of dance are even held at the site. New ideas are not just translated to movement – the artists also put on concerts, discussions and talks.
Once a tram depot, now artists’ studios
The large halls and warehouses on the site of the Uferstudios once housed trams and buses. The building complex was designed in the 1920s by the architect Jean Krämer for the Große Berliner Straßenbahn-AG on the banks of the Panke. Today, 14 large studios and ateliers offer international choreographers, dancers and other performance artists new and inspiring facilities for their work. Where everything used to be about innovation in public transport, the focus is now on movement as an art form.
The Uferstudios were ceremonially opened as a centre for contemporary dance in 2010. Since then, they have been a state-of-the-art location for production, rehearsals and training, as well as for public performances and events. There are facilities for freelance artists, as well as for established Berlin dance studios. These include:
The Tanzfabrik with its 30 years of experience in dance production and training. It occupies two studios, where it puts on courses, workshops and festivals.
The Tanzbüro Berlin is a network for the city’s dance scene and provides advice for artists.
The ada studio provides a stage for young choreographers and up-and-coming talent.
The Hochschulübergreifende Zentrum Tanz Berlin (HZT) teaches Bachelor’s and Master’s courses in dance, choreography and performance. The HZT occupies five studios and has a mediatheque, seminar rooms and offices.
Enjoy a coffee after the dance
Next-door Café Pförtner also pays tribute to the site’s former use as a tram and bus depot. In an old converted bus, you can enjoy the dishes while analysing the performances at the Uferstudios. Using natural ingredients, the cooks conjure up treats such as grilled asparagus with hazelnut dressing or white chocolate mousse. There’s a new menu every week. So feel free to come again, because at the Uferstudios too, the programme is always changing.","Opening hours

Berlin’s garish “pink tube” – the Umlauftank 2 on Schleuseninsel (sluice island) at the edge of the Tiergarten.",,,"In the opinion of architect Hans-Günter Merz, the Umlauftank 2, or UT2 for short, whose refurbishment he took charge of from 2014 to 2017, is “a cheeky structure”. As a research facility of the Technical University of Berlin it is used for flow measurement. The predecessor institute, the Versuchsanstalt für Wasserbau und Schiffbau (research institute for hydraulic engineering and shipbuilding), previously conducted tests here during the era of the German Empire. In 1967, the architect Ludwig Leo designed the new Umlauftank 2, which went into operation in 1974.
But the UT2 is more than just a research facility: Leo designed the “pink tube” as a counterpoint to the megalomaniac architecture of the National Socialists.
In the 1930s, the architect and general building inspector of the imperial capital, Albert Speer, widened today’s Straße des 17. Juni. It played an important role in the plans for the “global capital Germania”. In the 1970s, Ludwig Leo incorporated his enormous bright pink tube within the field of vision of this Nazi urban planning – and sent a clear signal.
Real eye-catcher
In the construction of the circulation tank, the architect focused primarily on the technical requirements. The colours reveals the function to the observer. The “pink tube” forms the water circuit. Inside, a turbine sets water masses in motion, generating a flow velocity of up to ten metres per second. Here, researchers test ships and ship models in real conditions. The vessels that fit into the 120-metre tube can be up to nine metres long.
This leads through a five-storey building clad in blue aluminium panels. It houses the laboratory hall, test benches and offices.
Renovated gem
The Umlauftank 2 is the largest in the world; international researchers and engineers travel to Berlin to use it for their experiments. And not only in the field of nautical science. Scientists have also studied the movement of penguins here.
For a long time, the Umlauftank 2 rusted away. The pink shell, made of polyurethane foam, did not age well. From 2014 to 2017, the Wüstenrot Foundation financed the restoration of the monument. Since then, Berlin’s idiosyncratic industrial monument has shone again in its pink and blue splendour.
Our tips for nearby the Umlauftank 2
In the vicinity of the Umlauftank 2 there are further Berlin Modernist sites to discover. For example the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church at Breitscheidplatz. Or take the 100 bus (direction Alexanderplatz) to the Lützowplatz stop. On the other side of the Landwehrkanal you will find the

Berlin",52.4936319,13.4299424,Architecture,2,FALSE,Former Kottbusser Ufer substation,"For the architect Hans Heinrich Müller, substations were more than just functional buildings: he gave each one an individual touch.",,,"By order of the BEWAG (Berlin municipal electricity board), Hans Heinrich Müller designed a total of 40 substations in the 1920s. They were not meant to be purely functional buildings, Müller wanted more. His substation on the former Kottbusser Ufer, which is today called Paul-Lincke-Ufer, looks like a church in North German Brick Gothic and was soon called the “Cathedral of Electricity”.
Bathed in light day and night
“Berlin is modern, modern due to its light, its fight against the night ... . I have now been in Berlin for eight days and have not noticed the night at all. ... Berlin is a single block of light.”
This is how the French painter Fernand Léger expressed his enthusiasm for Berlin's brightness in the 1920s. At that time, it was not yet common for a city to be illuminated at night. It was new, modern, and exciting. And Berlin owed it to electricity.
Electricity can only be supplied with the appropriate infrastructure – including substations. They reduce the voltage of electricity generated in power plants, enabling it to be used by industrial end users or private households.
Demand for new substations. In 1920, the Prussian State Assembly united the core city of Berlin with Charlottenburg, Neukölln, Spandau and other towns in the surrounding area to form Greater Berlin. This made the city the third largest metropolis in the world. However, it still lacked a common infrastructure, so BEWAG tasked Hans Heinrich Müller with setting it up.
Functional building with ambition
The substation erected on Kottbusser Ufer between 1926 and 1928 was the first to be built in the south-east of the new metropolis. The building resembled a nave with a bell tower.
However, Müller's substation was not a historicist building but a work of modernism. The building rests upon a steel skeleton and the brick façade is superimposed. Although Müller focused on the classical Brick Gothic style, he experimented with it all the same. The bricks have nuances of colour that make the façade appear less severe and the windows, which vary in size depending on the floor, also break up the massing of the building. The architect integrated expressionistic segments such as the dentil cornice into the façade.
Müller took care to adapt the height and orientation of the substation to the surrounding buildings. As a result, the building does not appear isolated despite its monumentality. The rooms and layout are geared towards its function: the architect grouped the transformer and cooling wing, phase shifter and machine hall, control room, switch house, residential house, and self-supply wing around a rectangular courtyard.
The substation on Kottbusser Ufer survived the Second World War. BEWAG closed it down in 1989, and it has meanwhile been restored as a listed building. While you won't find any cables and machines there today, you will find an event location and the Volt restaurant.",,,"Industrial Architecture

Urban Nation - Network
At regular intervals URBAN NATION, a young Berlin Street art network, brings national and international icons to the city. Street art greats like Handiedan, Jeff Soto and Dan Witz have all shaken their cans here. Their artworks can be seen all over this street and in the neighbouring streets, sometimes as meter-high murals, sometimes very small, almost hidden on posts and shutters.

A whole house as a work of art
The four-storey residential and commercial building at number 7 stands out particularly. It can already be seen from the above-ground subway. At regular intervals, a street artist transforms the entire facade into a gigantic mural. ONE has sprayed the word ""Revolution"" in meter-high, colorful letters on the façade. DALeast has let a golden eagle fly over the house. And the Iranian brothers IcyAndSot showed a wall falling scene on the building, based on an original photo.

A network becomes a museum
The Gründerzeit building was converted into the URBAN NATION MUSEUM FOR URBAN CONTEMPORARY ART by 2017 according to the plans of the GRAFT architectural office. The museum is a worldwide unique contact point for exhibitions, research and exchange around Urban Contemporary Art. It presents regularly changing exhibitions from its own unique collection and houses the Martha Cooper Library. The photojournalist was the first to make the emergence of Urban Art visible through her photo documentaries.

Changing Walls
As is typical for Urban Art, the museum with its changing murals will always change its appearance and itself become a work of art. The museum is a place for working, cross-media exchange, networking, research and teaching. There are educational formats and interactive workshops. A highline - a footbridge that runs through the space - makes it possible to view the artworks both from a distance and from very close up. Behind Urban Nation is Berliner Leben, a foundation of Gewobag. Its goal is to promote art and culture. In Schöneberger Bülowstraße this has been more than impressively achieved.","Opening hours:

The inconspicuous villa on Reichpietschufer has an interesting and varied story to tell.

The history of the villa
One of the last remaining villas in the Tiergarten was built between 1860 and 1862 as a private residence for Baron August von der Heydt. The Neo-Renaissance building was also designed for representative purposes, with the gardens designed by the famous landscaper Peter Joseph Lenné. Later a minister under Bismarck, von der Heydt lived in his idyllically located villa until his death in 1874.

Von der Heydt’s son Eduard rented the villa to China’s first envoy to the German Empire. Once Liu Xihong moved in, opium and tobacco smoke soon rose from the villa by the Landwehrkanal. He turned the villa into a guest house, serving exotic dishes and delicacies such as dried duck, ham and shark fins.

In 1890 the property returned to the von der Heydt family. August’s great-nephew Karl was a banker and art collector. He threw wild parties and established the house as a salon for Berlin’s high society. Many poets, including Rainer Maria Rilke, were frequent visitors. After the First World War, the villa was bought by the “Allgemeiner deutscher Sportverein e.V.” (German Sports Club). The name was misleading, however, because it was really an exclusive club for illegal card games such as poker and baccarat. A raid in 1933 put a stop to the illicit shenanigans.

Destroyed and rebuilt
After the bombing of the Second World War, all that was left of the house was its basement, which was used for a time as an illegal schnapps still. Later, chocolates and sweets were made there. In 1966 the Villa von der Heydt was declared a historic building and its recovery from the troubles of the previous decades could begin. In 1971, planning began on rebuilding the upper floors and renovating the basement vaults, and the villa was restored between 1976 and 1980. Since then, it has been the official seat of the President of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation.

The villa is situated in the Calandrelli complex in the shade of tall old trees – the best place to view it is over a leisurely coffee in the cafeteria of the neighbouring Bauhaus archive.

GDR opponents, people who helped others to flee and political prisoners are all familiar with the former Stasi prison. Today the Berlin Hohenschönhausen Memorial remembers their story. Contemporary witnesses guide you over the site that houses 44 years of political persecution. Large parts of the building have been preserved and give you an authentic impression of the prison conditions between 1946 and 1990. It is therefore no wonder that the memorial attracts more than 400,000 visitors every year.

The permanent exhibition Inhaftiert in Hohenschönhausen – Zeugnisse politischer Verfolgung [Incarcerated in Hohenschönhausen – Witnesses of Political Persecution] shows 300 photos and nearly 500 artefacts including prison clothes and letters from inmates. It depicts the everyday lives of the inmates as well as the story of the former Stasi prison. Now for the first time, separate part of the exhibition looks at the world of the culprits.

Since 28 March 2019, the special exhibition Stasi in Berlin shows the dimensions of this state repression both in the capital of the GDR and in West Berlin. On a walk-in, 160 square meter aerial photograph, visitors explore numerous service objects and thousands of conspiratorial apartments with the help of tablets. Photos, videos and documents illustrate the extent of surveillance. Visitors follow in the footsteps of numerous individual fates - surveillance measures, kidnappings, arrests. What is surprising is how strongly the Stasi was also present in the western part of the city.

History: from an industrial kitchen to a Stasi prison
A special Soviet camp was set up on the site of a former industrial kitchen in the north-east of Berlin at the end of the Second World War. After the camp was closed in October 1946, the central Soviet custodial prison for East Germany was established in the cellar of the building. The Ministry for State Security took it over in 1951 and expanded it with a new building in 1961 and used it until 1989 as a central custodial prison. Thousands of political prisoners were incarcerated here included nearly every famous GDR opponent.

The prison was sited in a restricted military area that was hermetically sealed from the outside world. The area was not even marked on any East German city map. Today, the site of the former prison of the Ministry for State Security in Berlin-Hohenschönhausen stands for the history of political persecution in the Soviet-occupied zone and the GDR like almost no other location in Germany.

On the top of the hill stands a national monument and there is a small, romantic park. Nowhere else in the city can you enjoy the atmosphere of a babbling waterfall.
From a vineyard to a national memorial
In the 18th century, Berlin’s highest hill was known as Tempelhofer Berg or sometimes Runder Weinberg (“Round Vineyard”). Not a lot of people know it, but Berlin was once a wine-growing region, and vines really were grown on Tempelhofer Berg right up to the 18th century. The tradition was revived in 1968, and you can acquire a drop of the Kreuz-Neroberger white wine in return for a donation and sample the Berlin tipple for yourself.
In 1818, the foundation stone was laid for the construction of a national memorial in the Neo-Gothic style, designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel. The monument was dedicated in 1821 by King Friedrich Wilhelm III. It symbolised the victorious campaign over Napoleon Bonaparte and the liberation of Europe from French domination. The monument eventually led to the creation of the park 73 years later.
A waterfall right in the middle of Berlin
The Riesengebirge – the mountains now known as the Krkonoše on the border between Poland and the Czech Republic – were once the top destination for nobles and wealthy Berliners whenever they had time to spare. The waterfall that can now be admired in Viktoriapark is a replica of a waterfall from those mountains, rendered as accurately as possible using geological studies.
In 1888, Kaiser Friedrich III decided that the monument needed surroundings that befitted it. The park is named in honour of his English wife Victoria. The idea of the waterfall came from Hermann Mächtig, the city’s director of parks and gardens. Made of large rocks, the waterfall is deceptively true to its model in the mountains – the only difference being that the 24-metre-high waterfall is in the middle of the city and powered by a pump.
The beer garden in Viktoriapark
At the foot of the Kreuzberg, Golgatha is not just for beer drinkers. It has a large beer garden and terrace where you can relax and dance in the evening. Another popular place to go is the Osteria No. 1 on Kreuzbergstraße.

Berlin, Reinickendorf",52.5675711,13.3510702,Architecture,2,FALSE,Weiße Stadt (White City),"The Weiße Stadt in Reinickendorf, built between 1929 and 1931, ranks today as one of the key housing estates of Berlin modernism.",,,"At the end of the 1920s, Martin Wagner, head of the municipal planning and building control office, had a problem: the income from the house interest tax, which he had introduced in 1924 to finance the construction of social housing, was declining rapidly due to the poor economic situation. Nevertheless, he had to create more living space and there was a particularly urgent need for small apartments.

More space for experiments

Wagner set up a special construction programme and made 15 million Reichsmark available from budgetary funds. Without the money from the house interest tax, the architects no longer had to comply with requirements such as floor heights or room sizes. This was an enticing opportunity that promised greater freedom.

Three architects, Wilhelm Büning, Bruno Ahrends and Otto Rudolf Salvisberg, were commissioned by Wagner to build more than 1,200 new apartments in the Reinickendorf district along the Schillerpromenade (today’s Aroser Allee).

Despite the greater scope for design, cost-saving construction was the top priority here too. The best way to save money was to incorporate uniform elements such as doors, windows and stairwells. The three architects even agreed on a common house depth of exactly 9.40 metres.

One of the measures shaped the appearance of the housing estate: the uniformly coated white plaster gave it its unmistakable appearance as well as the nickname “Weiße Stadt”, or White City.

White houses, three variations
Salvisberg designed the urban development concept: green spaces for collective use and a mixture of edge and ribbon development. The Aroser Allee formed the centre, with a bridge structure in its centre designed by Salvisberg himself.

The view down the avenue is still the most famous image of the housing estate to this day. Arriving from Emmentaler Straße, the viewer first sees Ahrends’ buildings standing like a gateway. At five storeys, they tower above all the other buildings and give the housing estate the appearance of a fortress.
This is an effect that Ahrends stressed with further elements: the tiny windows on the top floor look like loopholes, in addition there are permanently fixed flagpoles. The architect thus emphasised the ideological aspect of the new housing estate as that of a loyal community.
The row buildings along Aroser Allee also form part of Ahrends’ work. He made use of expressionist elements to give them an individual look. For example, the stairwells are framed by bricks and the window and door frames are offset in vibrant colours from the bright white façades.
The bridge building, a 40-metre-wide reinforced concrete structure by Otto Rudolf Salvisberg, sits enthroned in the middle of Aroser Allee on four rows of columns. The design appears elegant, almost weightless between the rows of houses on the left and right. Salvisberg’s construction uses what are known as access balconies. This means that the residents enter the apartments via external entrances. In this way, the architect could save a staircase and at the same time ensure good ventilation of the apartments, wholly in keeping with the concept of New Objectivity.
The architect Wilhelm Büning concentrated primarily on row buildings. Strictly speaking, this basic principle requires all buildings to be oriented in a north-south direction. This creates ideal lighting conditions in the apartments. However, Büning did not adhere to this principle; he arranged his houses in a fan shape between Genfer Straße and Schillerring. His framed stairwell windows are an eye-catcher, and the protruding parts of the roofs contrast in colour with the white façades.
Together you are less alone
The outdoor facilities of the Weiße Stadt were designed by landscape architect Ludwig Lesser, who had already collaborated on another housing estate, the Gartenstadt Falkenberg. Unlike there, he no longer created tenant gardens, but primarily designed areas for collective use. Green spaces, with children’s playgrounds and seating, which were also embraced by adults.

This community aspect of the housing estate was complemented by the unusually high social standards of the Weiße Stadt. The residents had access to a large number of welfare institutions such as a nursery, doctor’s practice and more than 20 shops. A district heating plant with a connected laundry also made the housing estate self-sufficient in terms of energy requirements.

Shortly after its completion, the Weiße Stadt was already regarded as a successful example of modern housing construction. Photos of the white façades appeared in the international press. Damage caused during the Second World War was subsequently repaired under the supervision of Wilhelm Büning between 1949 and 1954.

The Zucker-Museum has been in existence since 1904. For a long time it's reserved for trade visitors, and at times, it is part of the Technische Universität Berlin. In 1988, it becomes a regional museum. In 2012 the collection moves (from the Institute of Food Technology) to the Deutsches Technikmuseum. The redesigned exhibition finally opens in 2015. Entrants to the museum may be surprised that the expected sugary sweets are nowhere to be seen. Instead, you find a Japanese spider crab, cellulose, a balloon, paper cups, plastic bags and many other familiar everyday objects. The exhibition concept arouses curiosity. Gradually visitors learn how our world is to a large extent made from sugar. Plants store the sun's energy in it, the exoskeletons of crabs are made of the substance and the polymer is also the basis for many modern materials, such as plastic. Find out why without sugar, there would be no alcohol. Learn why with a historical distillation apparatus.

The entire exhibition is integrated into the Deutsches Technikmuseum; A modern establishment that focuses on interaction and discovery. Huge glass display cases show historic sugar cans and sugar bowls. Witness sophisticated everyday culture in the noble salons, or see how an old-fashioned sugar cane mill works. Between the 16th and 18th centuries, cities like Antwerp, Hamburg and London arise as major European trade hubs and refining centres. A model ship shows how the sweet, brown mass is transported in barrels across the Atlantic. Pictures and lithographs show the arrival of the first cargo of sugar in Antwerp. In 1749, Berlin chemist Andreas Sigismund Marggraf discovers beet sugar. Franz Carl Achard, the Director of the Royal Prussian Academy, breeds sugar beet and produces sugar in Berlin up until 1783. A model shows Achard's beet sugar factory.

The façades of the Niederschönhausen residential complex featured neoclassical elements, which the architect Paul Mebes extolled in his book on this ideal.

They consisted mainly of red Brandenburg bricks. Only the upper third of the building blocks had plain white decorative bands. Mebes notably broke up the massing by structuring the buildings: loggias with half-round openings, protruding alcoves, and gables gave the houses their symmetrical structure.

Reducing the buildings to basic geometric forms conveyed a feeling of tranquillity, which was further enhanced by the planting. The greenery created a harmonious contrast to the red façades.

Besides breaking with the Wilhelminian architectural style, the focus was also on improving living conditions. The intention was for tenants to be able to enjoy more light and sun in the Paul Francke housing estate, which is why all the apartments were situated in a sunny position and had a loggia overlooking the greenery.

The Niederschönhausen residential complex marked the beginning of Paul Mebes’ many years of design activity in Berlin. He designed numerous building projects together with Paul Emmerich, including other residential complexes.

In the field of architecture, the focus was no longer on striving for modernity, characterised by the demolition of old buildings and the 
construction of new estates on the outskirts of the city. The focus of urban development – also due to protests from parts of the population – was on upgrading of the inner cities and a renaissance of the industrial revolution era houses. This was done by means of the renovation and gutting of old buildings on the one hand and by the construction of new residential complexes on the other. 
Retreat in the city
Such a complex was built in 1981 in southern Friedrichstadt. Today centrally located in the city centre, when the city was divided the site was close to the Berlin Wall.
After renowned architects such as Hans Kollhoff had already completed housing projects there, the Luxembourg architect Rob Krier took on the task of planning the Ritterstraße-Nord residential complex between Lindenstraße and Alte Jakobstraße. Krier had already designed the Ritterstraße-Süd section at the end of the 1970s, but this second part to the north of the street was much larger with a total of 315 apartments in 35 buildings. The complex was thus one of the largest projects of the IBA.
Krier's most striking design feature: the arrangement of perimeter block buildings around residential courtyards, which can only be reached via gatehouses. Feilnerstraße forms a central axis, around which four apartment blocks are grouped. With this closed building design, the architect wanted to keep the living space “completely shielded from its shattered environment”. In spite of the inner city location, there were to be opportunities for retreat and relaxation. 
Seamless transition
A total of seven architecture companies were involved in the individual designs of the buildings, among the architects was Axel Schultes, who later designed the Federal Chancellery [internal link]. Together, the offices developed the concept for the complex and created individual yet harmoniously coordinated buildings. 
The style is postmodern, which also means that a widely varied mix of materials and shapes can be found here. On Ritterstraße and in the interior, the façades are brightly plastered, a contrast to the reddish-brown brick façades facing Lindenstraße, Oranienstraße and Alte Jakobstraße. 
One of these brick buildings is also the former National Debt Administration at the corner of Oranienstraße and Alte Jakobstraße, which today houses the Health, Care and Equality department of the state of Berlin. The expressionist building designed by architect German Bestelmeyer dates from the Weimar Republic. After its renovation, it blended seamlessly with the Ritterstraße-Nord residential complex, in line with the IBA's plans for the continued use of modernised old buildings.  
Playful use of historical references is an important part of postmodern architecture. The best example is the Feilnerhaus at Feilnerstraße 4, designed by Rob Krier. This used to be the site of a 
classicist residential building designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, which burnt down during the Second World War. The proportions of the building and structural details such as cornices and window dimensions are reminiscent of the previous building. Krier also borrowed from history in the use of arcade arches, which divide the brick façades on Feilnerstraße. 
Space for places 
The central point of the residential complex is the Schinkelplatz, a 30-meter-wide square, framed by four gatehouses. From here all parts of the complex can be reached, passages in the corners of the square lead to the four large garden courtyards. Each of them follows an own design concept of the architects Jasper Halfmann and Klaus Zillich. To the northwest is the Pergola garden, with plant-covered porticoes and a children's playground. In the northeastern courtyard there are small tenant gardens for the residents of the ground floor apartments, here another pergola provides privacy. Such colonnades are also found in the other two yard gardens, the ""Zellgarten"" (cell garden) and the ""Gehirngarten"" (brain garden). For the latter, Halfmann and Zillich were inspired by a cross-section of the human brain. 
The surroundings of the residential complex, about which Rob Krier spoke in the early eighties, have not been “shattered” for a long time now. But the residential courtyards continue to create a perfect retreat for all those who need a break from city life. ",,,Grand Tour of Berlin Modernism,https://www.visitberlin.de/system/files/styles/visitberlin_bleed_header_visitberlin_mobile_1x/private/image/Wohnanlage_Ritterstrasse_BIT_1974_c_LDA_Foto_Bittner_DL_PPT_0.jpg?h=7a33394f&itok=TM21M9rF,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/ritterstrasse-nord-residential-complex,,,,

The estates, built between 1919 and 1934, are outstanding examples of the residential architecture of the 1920s.

In contrast to house building in Berlin in the time of the German Empire with dark backyards and cramped flats without any daylight and lacking basic hygienic facilities, bright, light-filled apartments were created. The buildings are important witnesses to the social housing not only of that period but also of the entire 20th century.

Light and Air
Berlin’s rise to a metropolis in the 19th century went hand in hand with enormous housing problems. Factory workers lived in confining, dark flats in tenement buildings with several backyards. Changes in the law at the end of the 19th century, combined with the founding of housing cooperatives, enabled a residential building programme based on social reform, the realisation of a new social living culture and concepts of life derived from the English garden city model. Light and air were the declared goals. These housing estates were built in the plain, straightforward aesthetic Bauhaus style without any decorations or frills – albeit with plenty of colourful designs. The period of democratic housing building came to an end in 1933, since the Nazis had a completely different, anti-modern concept of housing building. Fortunately they hardly changed the existing buildings and most of them survived the Allied bombing raids of the Second World War intact. Today the flats and houses of the Modernism housing estates are much coveted in the property market.

Time and time again, German history was made here. It is where Dietrich Bonhoeffer worked, and also where opponents of the East German regime met and set up a secret library.

The history of the Zionskirche
The church owes its existence to a failed assassination. In 1861, Kaiser Wilhelm I, grateful for having survived an attempt on his life, donated funds to build a new votive church. After a number of arguments between various authorities, work began in 1866. At what was then the highest point in Berlin, a church was built with a brick and terracotta façade. The architect August Orth chose what was then the very popular Berlin Historicist style: Neo-Classical combined with Gothic elements. After all, the church was not only intended as a place of worship, but also as a patriotic expression of royal gratitude.

In the Second World War, bombs destroyed the roof, the organ, the altar and the choir windows. At the end of the war, Berliners looted the church in search of firewood. Later damage to the roof was not repaired, which meant that church was in a very poor state for a long time. Restoration began at the end of the 1980s, beginning with the roof, and now continuing in the interior. The Zionskirche reopened in 2002 and services are held there every Sunday.

Dietrich Bonhoeffer - a man of courage
Dietrich Bonhoeffer worked in the parish from 1931. After the Nazis took power he joined the resistance. He was arrested in 1944 and executed at Flossenbürg concentration camp on 5 April 1945 – just before the end of the war. A bronze memorial to him was erected on the west side of the church in 1997.

Opposition in the GDR    
In the mid-1980s, opposition groups such as the “Zion’s Church Peace and Environmental Circle” began meeting in the basement of the church. It was also where they hid the “Umwelt-Bibliothek” (Environmental Library), containing officially prohibited books and magazines on environmental and human rights topics. Following a raid, the Stasi arrested some of the members, which only brought the group to wider attention. Supporters held vigils and the events were closely reported in the Western media. The arrested members were soon released and the group gained great popularity, becoming a driving force in the civic movement that led to the end of the GDR.

The permanent exhibition in the Zionskirche
“Erinnerung wird zur Kraft der Gegenwart” (memory becomes the power of the present) is a quote by Dietrich Bonhoeffer and is the title and guiding motif of an unmissable exhibition on the Zionskirche and its turbulent history. The exhibition deals with Bonhoeffer’s struggle in the resistance, as well as the story of the Environmental Library and the commitment of the community, thus showing how closely the church is linked with German history.

"Akazienhof, 12524 Berlin",52.4118315,13.56790657,History,1,FALSE,Gartenstadt Falkenberg estate,"Here, following the English model of garden cities, architect Bruno Taut first plans an estate with colourful facades.
",,,"A colourful garden city estate
Berlin's population nearly quadruples in the late 1800s. Around 1910, the city is bursting at the seams. Many people are living in overcrowded tenement blocks built rapidly to provide cheap housing. These large blocks of four to five storeys have front, lateral and rear buildings often enclosing several courtyards. The apartments, especially in the rear courtyards, are often cramped, dark and unhealthy.

Living in such conditions, how can workers in cities remain healthy? That pressing question is already driving social reform in England in the shape of the garden city movement - and their ideas strike a chord in Germany as well. Founded in 1902, the German Garden City Association (Deutsche Gartenstadtgesellschaft) sets up a building society for greater Berlin and purchases the plot of land around Falkenberg in Berlin's Altglienicke district. In 1912, it then commissions Bruno Taut, just 32 years old, to design a new residential estate on the model of a garden city.

A residential estate with a community feeling

In the three years between 1913 and 1916, a total of 128 homes are constructed. Taut begins in 1913 by designing 23 residential units in the intimate ""Akazienhof"" cul-de-sac development. Around a central greened square, he sets 34 terraced houses for individual families, as well as two semi-detached and one detached house.

This ensemble, arranged in groups, creates something of a small village atmosphere. Here, many years before he designs the Hufeisensiedlung residential estate, Taut is already applying his principle of constructing a self-contained residential courtyard. Rather than the view from the window seeking to force people to become neighbourly, it is intended to encourage a sense of community. In 1913, the first tenants already move in. Over the course of the next two years, the first buildings are followed by a further 94 residential units along the Gartenstadtweg street. In 1916, despite the First World War, some individual houses are still built.

In his design, Taut breaks with traditionally uniform designs in architecture. Instead, as you'll notice when you stroll through the estate today, the units are not arranged symmetrically, but form groups of one and two-storey buildings. Some are set back from the street to avoid straight axes. It almost seems as if the houses personify the individuals living there, each for itself yet unified in their shared space.

This impression is strengthened by one particular feature - for the first time, Taut uses coloured plaster on the external walls. For example, along Gartenstadtweg, he has 14 colour tones in different combinations, leading the development to be nicknamed the ""paintbox estate"".

Moreover, Bruno Taut crucially moves away from the florid designs in the early years of Imperial Germany towards the reduced formal vocabulary later characteristic of modernist architecture. Nonetheless, he still employs standard design elements, with saddleback roofs, red beaver tail tiles and wooden window shutters evoking a rural lifestyle.

The spatial setting matters

Landscaping plays a key role in the idea of the garden city. Taut's residential estate in the Altglienicke district is Berlin's first housing development with an elaborate plan for greening and landscaping.

The estate's built and open spaces form a dialogue, with the lines of avenues and hedges emphasising the spatial design and plants and shrubs blending in with the overall colour scheme. Bruno Taut defines this concept as ""outdoor living space"", an important feature of his architectural oeuvre - and one still visible today in the Falkenberg Garden City.
","Please remember:
When you visit the Gartenstadt Falkenberg estate, you are visiting people's homes. We would ask you to respect their privacy! Thank you!","The garden city movement emerged in England in the late 1890s and early 1900s. The leading founding figure of this approach to urban planning was Ebenezer Howard, who propagated the ""marriage of town and country"". He saw garden cities as a middle ground to battle overcrowding and slums in large cities without reverting to the potential backwardness of purely rural life. Instead, his garden cities were economically independent and organised to develop and support a sense of community.

",,,"Innovative housing in Berlin’s Wedding district
In Berlin's first housing association project, architect Bruno Taut successfully applied his innovative ideas for urban architecture.

1924 is a key year in the development of reform housing projects in Berlin. Martin Wagner, then city planner for the Schöneberg district, calls for the introduction of a rent tax. After hyperinflation, the devaluation of mortgages leaves many landlords practically debt free. Through the rent tax they contribute to funding the housing so urgently needed in the municipality of Greater Berlin, formed just a few years before.

1924 also sees work starting on Berlin's first inner-city housing association project. In its role as a property developer, the Berliner Spar- und Bauverein, a savings and building society, finds a site in the north of the city. Between 1924 and 1930, a total of 303 apartments are constructed here in three building phases .

The Neues Bauen movement in Berlin

The Schillerpark estate is not the only project of this kind. During the six years of its construction, other reform housing estates are also built, from a large estate in Britz to the 'White City' in Reinickendorf, the Carl Legien 'residential city' and the spreading Siemensstadt estate. Today, together with the Falkenberg Garden City, they are all inscribed as the UNESCO World Heritage Site Six Berlin Modernism Housing Estates.

For its new development in Berlin's Wedding district, the Berliner Spar- und Bauverein commissions Bruno Taut. Before the First World War, Taut establishes his reputation with his plans for the Falkenberg Garden City. Now, in the Schillerpark estate, he experiments with new ground plans for semi-open blocks. The buildings are set parallel to the street and create large courtyards as in perimeter block developments, but Taut divides the rows of houses at various points to open the courtyards to the street.

The traditional saddleback roofs are also out. His inspiration for the pent roofs and red brick façades comes from Holland, influenced by the Amsterdam School style of architecture. That influence can also be seen in the division of the rooms and the exterior façades.

Although the rent tax provides the funding, it comes with conditions attached: building can be a maximum of three full storeys (excluding attic floors, which Taut also constructed here). Each apartment must also have one room of 20 sq. metres.

Attractive green spaces for life quality

Through the openings to the street, the courtyards between the houses become a semi-open 'outdoor living space', as Taut called it. Moreover, his architecture also aims at creating a community feeling and encouraging social encounters.

A high percentage of the original residents are traditional left-wing supporters. After the National Socialist seizure of power in 1933, most have to move. While some are imprisoned or held in concentration camps, the Schillerpark's new residents are all sympathetic to the Nazi Party.

During the Second World War, the Schillerpark estate is badly damaged. In 1951, rebuilding starts overseen by Bruno Taut's brother Max. In the 1990s and 2000s, the buildings and landscaping are refurbished and restored.

",,,"Berlin’s lido
In May 1927 a fire breaks out at the Wannsee lido - just one day before the season is due to start! The thatch-roofed reception building is in flames. The fire brigade just manages to prevent the fire spreading to the other wooden buildings and adjoining woodland. But the good news is that the opening can still go ahead and the bathing season can begin.

Don't forget your cossie! 

Most Berliners live in small apartments with inadequate sanitary facilities. So when the weather's fine, they head out of the city en masse. Everyone wants to get into the countryside, and above all close to the water. As a result, public transport, outdoor swimming pools and country pubs and restaurants are all hopelessly overcrowded. Social Democrat city councillor and long-time director of the Wannsee lido, Hermann Clajus, wants to offer his guests a place to relax with friends and family, recharge their batteries and enjoy some healthy exercise. A place for city dwellers to drink in the sunlight and fresh air. 

Despite the near-disaster at the start of the season, in July 1927 the Wannsee lido welcomes a record number of visitors, with 65,000 people heading there to cool off. People are packed like sardines on the 800-metre stretch of sandy beach and there's barely room to move in the water. The ice cream and pickled gherkin sellers are doing a roaring trade. Gramophones play music, there's dancing on the beach and long queues form at the water slide. But despite the crowds, the place still has a calm, relaxed atmosphere. Trained lifeguards are on hand to keep people safe in the water. There's beer on sale in the restaurant, but no schnapps. Volunteer marshals ensure that peace, decency and cleanliness is maintained. There's also a lost and found office and a meeting point for lost children.  

Redevelopment in the style of the New Objectivity movement 

The near-catastrophe of the fire is seen as a good reason to work on extensive plans for redeveloping the lido. Martin Wagner, the new head of Berlin's municipal planning department, wants to provide the city's residents with more green spaces and sports facilities. He joins forces with architect Richard Ermisch to plan a ""cosmopolitan city lido"" that reflects the concepts of the New Objectivity movement.  

Their plans don't all come to fruition, but the new Wannsee lido is completed in 1930 and is as big, modern and popular as ever. Gardens are laid out above the embankment and yellow brick buildings are built along the beach. There are changing rooms and sanitary facilities, colonnades offering protection from sun and rain, sports facilities, scenic walking trails, a row of shops and a new beach restaurant. Even today, the complex is considered a prime example of the New Objectivity style and a monument to the socio-political ambitions of the 1920s. 

Unfortunately, peace doesn't always reign at the lido - the growing political tensions even find their way to the beach. In the summer of 1930, the Nazis provoke several mass brawls. In March 1933, the director of the lido, Hermann Clajus, finds himself faced with imminent dismissal and arrest. He commits suicide.

Hilde Steinbrink stares defiantly down the barrel of the gun. The young revolutionary stands with her back to the wall. Around her lie the bodies of her comrades who have already been executed. She waits for the order to fire. Later on, in court, she recalls: ""I didn't say a word, because by then I didn't give a damn"". 

But the order to fire is never given. Instead, the soldiers hurl abuse at the Spartacist. ""See, gunpowder's too good for you, we'll rip you open and cut you up so that everyone has a piece of you!"" 

Battle for the Vorwärts building 

On 5 January 1918, mass protests break out when police chief Emil Eichhorn, a supporter of the radical Spartacist League, is fired. The demonstrators spontaneously decide to occupy Berlin's newspaper district. Hilde Steinbrink, a mother of two from Neukölln, joins other revolutionary workers to storm the headquarters of Vorwärts, the newspaper of the SPD party. The Social Democratic government under Friedrich Ebert is worried that there could be a Russian-style coup. So this amateurish uprising provides an opportunity to crush the ""Bolshevik menace"", as the movement has been dubbed by the press over recent weeks. 

SPD member and later Minister of Defence Gustav Noske sends troops marching into the centre. The poorly-armed revolutionaries are no match for the battle-hardened former soldiers that make up the Freikorps. On the morning of 11 January, they turn their machine guns and mortars on the Vorwärts building.  The revolutionaries realise their situation is hopeless, so they send out a delegation with a white flag to negotiate terms. But the bombardment continues until the occupiers offer their unconditional surrender. 

""Beat Red Rosa to death!"" 

Between 200 and 300 revolutionaries, including 20 women, step out onto the street with their hands up. The government's troops greet them with blows, kicks and insults. Hilde Steinbrink is a particular target of their hatred because they think she fired the machine gun that claimed the most Freikorps victims. They also believe she is actually Rosa Luxemburg.  

Jeered at by the soldiers and beaten with sticks by passers-by, the prisoners are herded to the nearby Dragoon barracks. There they are set about with rifle butts and riding whips. Finally, they are lined up against a wall and forced to look at the grotesquely arranged corpses of their comrades who attempted to negotiate with the government. 

The soldiers mockingly tell them to expect the same fate. For an hour, they stare down the barrel of the machine gun, fearing for their lives. The cruel game is only brought to an end when Friedrich Stampfer, editor-in-chief of Vorwärts, intervenes. Four days later, the leaders of the Spartacist movement, Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, are captured. This time, no-one is there to save them.
",,"On 7 July 1919, Hilde Steinbrink and 11 of her comrades are sentenced to one year in prison for ""being a member of an unauthorised armed group"". The court finds no evidence that she actually fired the machine gun. The soldiers who murdered the negotiators at the Vorwärts protest walk away scot-free.

",,,"A Hollywood star drops his trousers
The crowds have been waiting for hours in front of Friedrichstraße station. Cameramen and photographers have clambered onto the roofs of their cars to get a clear view of its purple entry hall. A Hollywood star is arriving in Berlin on 9 March 1931. Berlin's own film star Marlene Dietrich is also arriving on the Holland Express, but that's not who they're waiting for. Everyone is there to see the greatest silent movie star of the age: Charlie Chaplin.

Chaplin arrives on the dot at 5.17 pm. He is the first to get off the train. Despite his grey hair, he still looks youthful and is deeply tanned. The Vossische Zeitung reports: ""He smiles his famous smile. The crowd erupts in cheers and surges towards him.""  Chaplin patiently signs autographs. The police try to clear a way to the car, but his fans swarm through the barriers, trying to touch their idol.  

Talking up the silent film 

It's all a little different from nine years ago, when Chaplin visited Berlin for the first time. At that time Friedrichstraße station was run-down and decrepit, and no-one recognised the actor. But now it is Berlin's most modern station with its own subway connection, and Chaplin is a huge star on a major European tour. He is here to promote his latest movie, City Lights. This silent film is a declaration of war on the new-fangled talkies. Chaplin wants to show the world that a mime can express more through his actions than an actor through words.  

By sheer chance, he is driven past the famous Wintergarten theatre in the Hotel Central, directly behind Friedrichstraße station. This is where the Skladanowsky brothers presented the first moving pictures as the final act of a variety show in 1895 - paving the way for the new medium of film and its first stars.

A horde of screaming fans are waiting for Chaplin outside the Hotel Adlon. Once again he has to sign autographs, shake hands, smile and nod. Suddenly he feels his trousers sliding down.

Chaplin has again slipped into his most famous role: that of the ""Tramp"", the vagabond with the baggy pants.

",,,"Death outside the cinema
It's a Sunday evening in August 1931. People are queuing outside the Babylon cinema on Bülowplatz. They are there to see that evening's Hollywood production: Jungle Woman. But everyone is buzzing about something more exciting than the film: Did you hear? - What? - Fritz Auge was shot yesterday! - The Communist? - Yeah, him. Here on Bülowplatz. - Who shot him? - Schweinebacke's security police of course! - Unbelievable! What the... - Shhhh! He's coming.

All the locals know the three policemen who are striding towards the cinema. Paul Anlauf, known as ""Schweinebacke"" - ""pig's cheek"" - is head of the 7th police district. Alongside him are captain Franz Lenck and sergeant Richard Willig, nicknamed ""the Hussar"". Over the last few years they have been trying to keep the peace in this area around the Communist Party headquarters on Bülowplatz, but it's a constant flashpoint. 19-year-old worker Fritz Auge was shot dead during a scuffle with police on 8 August 1931, but he was not the first victim of the troubles. Two members of the security police were also shot dead here earlier in the year, and a third was seriously injured. The graffiti on the walls screams: ""Two policemen will be killed for every worker shot! The Red Front claims revenge!"" 

Shots fired on Bülowplatz 

As the three officers approach the Babylon, a voice behind them calls out: ""You take the Hussar, you take Schweinebacke, and you the other one."" Shots ring out. Anlauf falls to the ground dead. Lenck is hit in the back but manages to pursue his attackers into the cinema foyer before collapsing. Willig is also seriously wounded, but he pulls out his revolver and starts shooting wildly. One of his bullets hits and kills 16-year-old worker Gerhard Bolle. 

Local police rush to the cinema and start searching the crowd, but the killers have escaped through the rear courtyard. Police raid the Karl Liebknecht House and confiscate the latest edition of the Red Flag. In the hours that follow, the furious police beat up anyone that moves, shoot at people as they run away, and even fire at the surrounding buildings, claiming they are being shot at by local residents. In the end, the police estimate that, in addition to their murdered colleagues, two ""agitators"" have been killed and 30 wounded, including women and children. 

Over the following weeks, the Communist Party of Germany's headquarters remains closed and the Red Flag is banned. Bülowplatz is closed off to prevent further clashes. Police arrest dozens of Communists during their hunt for the attackers, but they can't find any clear evidence of direct involvement in the crime. The two shooters are well on their way to Moscow. One of them, the 23-year-old Red Front fighter Erich Mielke, is destined to gain further notoriety in East Germany.

""In the name of the people, the defendant is acquitted at the expense of the state treasury.""  

Applause breaks out in the wood-panelled Room 500 when the presiding judge of the 14th Criminal Court announces the acquittal. But the elderly ladies in the audience are the only people in court who agree with the verdict pronounced in their name.  

It is undisputed that 39-year-old police inspector Karl-Heinz Kurras shot 26-year-old student Benno Ohnesorg on the evening of 2 June 1967. But should he be convicted? The court decides to follow the traditional principle of giving the accused the benefit of the doubt. Der Spiegel magazine comments: ""Would a German court have ruled the same way if a policeman had been shot by a student with a similarly unresolved question of guilt?"". 

A few days later, just such a student is sitting in the dock. Fritz Teufel is accused of committing a serious breach of the peace, also on the evening of 2 June, during the protests against the Shah's visit. The witnesses are two police officers, who say they saw him throwing stones.                                                                                                              But Teufel is not brought to the court through the imposing entrance and magnificent lobby that you can now enter, this 'cathedral' symbolising the grandeur of the law.  This magnificent building of Wilhelmine Berlin was built between 1902 and 1906. When it opened, it was the first building in the city to have electric lighting. But all the technical advances, from elevators to central heating and telephones, are of little use to Fritz Teufel. Since 2 June, he has been housed in the star-shaped remand prison on the eastern side of the criminal court complex. He is led directly to the courtroom via a labyrinth of hidden corridors. 

The courtroom becomes a soapbox   

The inhabitant of the political commune known as Kommune I knows how to make the most of the occasion, provoking the court with his witty remarks and insinuations. He shows little respect for the rituals of justice, showing up in bright clothes and with tousled hair. And as for standing up when the judges enter the courtroom? Teufel tells the court he will only stand ""If it serves to reveal the truth"". He is acquitted on 22 December 1967 - the policemen who accused him were lying, and Teufel is once again a free man after spending 148 days in prison.  

Kurras also lied. He presented the court with several versions of how Ohnesorg came to be shot. Keen to cover up the circumstances of his death, the Berlin police donated 60,000 D-Marks to his defence fund. On that fateful evening, student Friederike Dollinger cradled Ohnesorg's head as he lay dying. She says: ""The acquittal of Kurras was a turning point. It increased my sense of distance and scepticism towards the Federal Republic of that time. This tortuous notion of putative self-defence that contradicted everything I experienced that night."" 

She was not the only one to feel like this, and the student movement began to gain traction. Meanwhile, Teufel joined the underground 2 June Movement, named after the date of Benno Ohnesorg's death. This led him further down a path of resistance that culminated in armed combat and terrorism.

Do you watch the TV series Babylon Berlin? Then perhaps you were expecting a vast, rather insalubrious nightclub with a brothel in the basement and a gigantic aquarium? And a restaurant serving up the body parts of business competitors? The original Moka Efti was a touch less decadent.

When it opened its doors in 1929, the Café Moka Efti was something special. It bagged the city's best location on the corner of Friedrichstraße and Leipziger Straße. Today it has been replaced by an office tower and apartment block. It was topped with a square tower in Wilhelmian style, a reminder of the Equitable Palace that used to stand on this spot. 

A café with unusual features 

At Moka Efti, guests sip their coffee in vast oriental-style salons. The patterned armchairs, colourful wall hangings, painted ceilings, sweeping arches and columns are all designed to give the place a Turkish, Moorish or Egyptian feel. One of the corridors is designed to look like a carriage on the Orient Express. There are concert rooms, a billiard room and - unusually for a café - a barber shop. Another remarkable feature is the office where secretaries handle the guests' correspondence. 

Moving on up 

But the most surprising thing is the escalator that transports people from the street up to the rooms on the first and second floors. In the late 1920s escalators are still a rarity in Berlin, so it proves to be an attraction in itself. The Moka Efti uses this new mode of transportation in its advertising and the escalator becomes the coffee house's trademark. But the new contraption worries sociologist and journalist Siegfried Kracauer. He suspects that they serve ""to sensualise the easy ascent to the upper echelons"". 

Best location in Berlin 

The Moka Efti certainly attracts a varied clientele, including business people, newspaper editors, clerks from the nearby offices and banks, shoppers and  tourists. Pop in for a shave and a coffee in the morning, sort out your overseas correspondence at lunchtime, then it's dancing and billiards in the evening. The Moka Efti stands out because it offers the whole caboodle. 

It seems likely that its exotic name comes courtesy of businessman Giovanni Eftimiades, who ran several restaurants in Berlin and sold coffee under the brand name Moka Efti.  

Two years after its opening, the Moka Efti branches out still further by setting up a dance hall. A hole is cut into the floor on the second storey so that punters can listen to the music from the palm-lined concert hall beneath. The coffee house gradually transforms itself into a dance hall and hosts the renowned James Kok Swing Orchestra in the 1930s.

He is lying on a hard stone floor. His left eye is bloodshot. His shirt clings to the wounds on his skin. The smell of sweat, blood and urine fills the air. It's 21 March 1933, and we are in one of the first Nazi concentration camps.

Imprisoned without trial 

As you go down the stairs in the brick building, the cold creeps into your bones. You are in the basement of an abandoned barracks in General-Pape-Straße. During the imperial era, the Railway Regiment was stationed here. During the First World War, this is where new recruits had to report for duty. They left with their uniform and rations in a cardboard box, which is why Berliners dubbed the street General-Pappkarton-Straße: General Cardboard Box Street.  When the Nazis sweep to power in 1933, the SA's Field Police move in. They begin arresting the party's political opponents. The basement becomes a prison, and the goon squad is given free rein. Denied legal counsel, the prisoners are at the mercy of the Field Police. They are lashed to within an inch of their lives. They are forced to stand to attention or exercise until they drop. They count themselves lucky if they are given a drop of weak coffee or filthy water to drink. The majority of detainees are opponents of Hitler.  

The neurologist Dr Fritz Fraenkel, a communist and a Jew, is a thorn in the Nazis' side. He is tortured then released, but only after signing a statement saying he has been well treated. He immediately flees to Switzerland with his family.  

Rediscovering a torture chamber 

For nine months, the cellar is the scene of unimaginable horrors. At least 30 prisoners die at the hands of the SA Field Police. Then the prison is closed and the cellar is all but forgotten. 

A memorial in the cellars on Papestraße finally opens in 2013. Look closely at the walls and you will see remnants of its days as a prison. When you step into the corridor you can make out some red letters on the bricks. There is also an imperial eagle carrying a swastika and the abbreviation ""Fepo"" for Field Police.

It's the 1980s, and West Berlin's most iconic club is jumping. Dschungel acts as a magnet for rampaging A-listers looking to dance the night away. Today all that's left of the club are the myths that surround it.

Knut Hoffmeister is sweating profusely as he drags his huge camera through the club. A few guests have already arrived, the bar staff are serving drinks, the neon lights change from yellow to purple to green. Filming is not allowed, but ""Lubo the Cerberus"" hasn't yet arrived to throw him out. So Hoffmeister sneaks a four-minute recording. It's 1986 and we're in Dschungel - the hottest, hippest club in West Berlin.     

New freedoms 

The club was first opened by Barbara Brandt and Todora Osikowski on Winterfeldplatz in the mid-1970s. The bar's legendary name - which was never displayed outside - came from its decor of palms and a mural of Disney's Jungle Book. It's a place where anything goes. There's no dress code, no focus on profit, no questions about your sexual orientation or where you're from. Jungle nights are all about openness, tolerance, and partying till 4 in the morning. Every night but Tuesday. 

Fights are rare, the motley crew of punters are just there to have fun. In 1978, Dschungel moves to Nürnberger Strasse 53, where it rapidly develops into a stylish and glamorous club, complete with secure entry systems. As Berlin's counterpart to Studio 54, musicians, artists and stars such as Nick Cave, Zazie de Paris, Martin Kippenberger, Prince and David Bowie are to be found mingling with the lesser mortals.  

Bowie is often spotted sitting at the bar, and he's also a fixture at the famous Café Anderes Ufer - Germany's first gay café. After all, he and roommate Iggy Pop only live two doors away. In his 2013 song Where Are We Now?  Bowie pays musical tribute to the Dschungel (""Sitting in the Dschungel, on Nurnberger Strasse"") and singer Annette Humpe also gives a nod to her favourite club: ""Let's see what's going on at the Dschungel. The music's hot, the neon lights are shining.""  

The end of an era 

West Berlin's club scene comes to an end when the Wall comes down. Techno is all the rage, and the party people move on to the clubs in Berlin's new centre.

",,,"A pogrom in the new German democracy
A crisp late autumn morning. On 5 November 1923, thousands of Berlin's unemployed gather outside Gormannstraße 13. They've heard the employment exchange is paying out benefits. During these crisis-ridden years after the First World War, poverty is rife in Berlin. Hyperinflation reaches its peak - with a loaf of bread costing 80 billion Reichsmark.

Anti-Semitic agitators in the crowd 

Towards 11 o'clock, officials at the employment exchange announce there will be no benefit payments. The crowd's anger is palpable. With people looking for someone to blame, populist agitators find it only too easy to stir up anti-Semitic feeling. They fuel the anger by claiming that Jews from the Scheunenviertel district have bought up the entire stock of stable-value currency available for emergencies. At that time, the Scheunenviertel is home to many Eastern European Jews, a group many locals long view with suspicion. 

Soon, a furious mob is on the move, going from house to house, looting apartments and businesses of the Jews living there - just like the Peretz cigar shop, here at Gormannstraße 24 on the corner of Mulackstraße. The rioters attack anyone they think looks Jewish, sometimes literally stealing the clothes off the backs of their victims. For a long time, the police only watch and wait, without intervening. 

Organised riots 

The riots and looting start around noon and spread to many city districts. But the events in the Scheunenviertel district are not a riot, but a pogrom. The violence is well-organised. Far from being a spontaneous outbreak of anger, this is an action orchestrated by several hundred supporters of the populist nationalist movement. The violence is coordinated from outside the Scheunenviertel district using bike patrols warning of approaching police and updating on current developments. Anti-Semitic attacks also take place in other German cities, such as Nuremberg and Oldenburg. And in Munich just a few days later, on 9 November 1923, Hitler makes his first attempt to seize power in what becomes known as the 'Beer Hall Putsch'. 

Accusations against the police  

In Berlin, around 20 members of an association of First World War German-Jewish veterans spontaneously seek to protect the Eastern European Jews. They face the mob in Linienstraße at the junction to Bülowplatz square. A packed police vehicle ignores their calls for help. Soon, they have to fear for their own lives. In the scuffle, one of the assailants is shot. The uniformed police arrest the Jewish veterans. They are taken to the courtyard at the Alexanderplatz police station, and on their way there, kicked and beaten. Max Domei, head of the police unit, shouts out: ""We'll show you Jew-boys."" A police superintendent threatens to have them stringed up. 

On the following day, the newspapers write of pogrom-style riots. The charges against the police involved lead to fines and prison sentences, all waived a little later. The damage is considerable - just as it is in the Peretz cigar shop. The calm after the end of hyperinflation turns out to be deceptive. But the Scheunenviertel district pogrom is already a harbinger of the reign of terror under the Nazi regime which, ten years later, destroys Jewish life in Berlin.
",,"Today, the employment agency in Gormannstraße 13 is a sports hall. In the courtyard, you can still see the old stucco inscriptions marking the separate entrances for women and men. Just around the corner in Oranienburger Straße, the impressive Neue Synagoge (New Synagogue) also testifies to the once flourishing Jewish community in Berlin.

Since time immemorial, man has tried to oppose this torrent. Marcus Aurelius' truism, uttered before his death in 180 AD, holds true to this day thanks to an art form popular in the ancient world: the sculptural reproduction of heads or entire bodies.

The exhibition of the Abguss-Sammlung Antiker Plastik includes the entire history of sculpture from antiquity in the 3rd millennium BCE to 500 AD.
Impressions from Berlin's Abguss-Sammlung Antiker Plastik
The birth of this sculpture museum marks the first Berlin collection of this kind. It opens in 1696 in the Akademie der Künste. Unfortunately during the Second World War most of the castings are damaged or destroyed. The reconstructed collection has been located in the western part of Berlin since 1988. Close to Schloss Charlottenburg, the entrance of the collection is located romantically under overhanging trees. Here you will find Cycladic sculptures of the Minoans and Mycenae. A naked discus thrower stands in the room, ready to throw his disc. Admire the human anatomy and how precisely the artist portrayed the musculature. In many sculptures from the Hellenistic era, you'll find allusions to Greek mythology. A nice example of this is the sculpture of the Farnese Bull. According to legend, the twins Zethus and Amphion bind their aunt on the horns of the beast as punishment for mistreating their mother. The sculptures of the Roman and Byzantine empires are slightly less dramatic. Scholars are presented in elegant togas, the garment of Roman citizens. Art from Mesopotamia and Egypt is also on display in this collection.","Thursday14:00 – 17:00

You have to look hard to find places like this. Even in cities like Berlin. An electric atmosphere created by open encounters with other members of the community and people from all over the world and an authentically creative place that seeks to discuss the truly important issues of sustainable urban living and make dreams come true.
Intensive exchange is the agenda at the Agora Collective in Neukölln
Social exchange should be fun and an everyday part of life, preferably in combination with some delicious food and plenty of room to develop new ideas and skills. The Agora Collective succeeds in making this happen in rooms and a café that always offer an inviting welcome for Berliners, visitors, or friends of friends. The collective has found the perfect home in a beautifully renovated old building in the trendy Neukölln district.
Nothing less than a real community
The Agora is often seen as an international community, but what it really is is an open place with free events about all sorts of topics open to anyone who's interested. Events are frequently geared to social and very local issues. This intentional seeking out of meaningful conversation and publicising of future-orientated projects is at the core of the Agora's open concept.
Time to get stuck in
Whether it's a workshop on urban gardening or a visit to the food assembly market, the Agora offers a surprising programme of exciting, yet unconventional workshops and events that don't preach principles of self-sufficiency and conscientious consumption, but instead demonstrate them by taking action. True to its motto ""Shape your city"" and ideally give it back something of value.
The now well-known event Give something back to Berlin evolved from an idea designed to create friendships between Berlin, its people, newcomers, and refugees. Often as many as 150 people will show up to spend time together, make a statement, and celebrate the fact that we all need to stick together to ensure a bright future for the global community.

Since its founding, the Berliner Akademie der Wissenschaften enjoys world-wide renown. It was a completely new approach with which Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz founded the “Königlich-Preußische Akademie der Wissenschaften” in 1700 in Berlin. While the “Royal Society” in London or the “Académie des sciences“ in Paris limited themselves to specific scientific fields, the Berliner Akademie was supposed to be all encompassing and bring together the natural sciences and humanities. This Leibnizian concept was so successful that it became the model for the founding of all further academies. Today, the “Berlin-Brandenburgische Akademie der Wissenschaften“ subdivides itself into five classifications comprising the humanities, social sciences, mathematics and natural sciences, biological sciences and medicine as well as the technical sciences. There are international leading scientists represented in each classification. The duties of the academy can be summed up within three areas. Firstly, it tends to dictionary projects, editions, documentations and bibliographies; to this also belongs the care of the extensive library and archive, in which documents spanning 300 years of Berlin’s scientific history are preserved. Secondly, it takes upon itself subjects of higher scientific and social significance and with them carries on its own research projects. And finally, thirdly, the academy offers a forum for the critical discussion of scientific questions.

The small sandstone relief with the arms of the Diestelmeyer family is older. Under Elector Joachim II, Lampert Diestelmeyer was chancellor of the Mark Brandenburg and lord of the Mahlsdorf manor. The little pulpit with the pelican on the sounding board tearing open its own chest to bring the dead boy back to life also dates to the same era. The congregation worships here every Sunday at 10:30, accompanied by music played on a one-of-a-kind organ by Schuke, a company founded in Potsdam in 1820. The congregation’s cantor is very committed to music and hosts concerts in the church every third Sunday of the month from March to October. The concerts usually start at 5:00 pm. The field stone church situated in the tranquil churchyard in the heart of the old village of Mahlsdorf is small, so most of the concerts are of chamber music. Admission is free, but donations are taken as you leave to help support the continued existence of the concert series.
The Orthodox congregation was founded in 1869 and was able to acquire its own piece of land on what is Wittlicher Straße in Weißensee, which was far outside the city limits at the time. As the Prussian state expanded into areas with mixed religious affiliations, it eventually allowed people to opt out of automatic membership in the local congregation. The law adopted for the Jewish community on 28 July 1876 meant that members of Adass Yisroel, having opted out of the main Jewish congregation, were no longer allowed to bury their dead in the latter’s cemetery. Abraham Michelson was the first person to be buried in its new cemetery on 24 February 1880. About 3,000 others were buried here until the site was destroyed during the Nazi period. The last burial was the congregation’s Torah scrolls that had been profaned. In the years after the Second World War the cemetery fell into disrepair. It was only in second half of the 1980s when a Jewish congregations began to reform in what was still Communist East Berlin that volunteers repaired it and saved it from further decay.

The memorial for soldiers and civilian employees who have lost their lives in service is in the grounds of the Ministry of Defence. In a memorial installation, you can hear the names read out of all those who have fallen since the establishment of the Bundeswehr.
The history of the monument
On 8 November 2009, the German President Horst Köhler inaugurated the memorial in the grounds of the Ministry of Defence adjacent to the Bendlerblock. The plans for a memorial had been submitted in 2005 by Franz Josef Jung, the Minister of Defence. Until then, there had been individual memorials, but nowhere in honour of all the Bundeswehr’s dead. Both the idea itself and the choice of location initially received criticism. A commission chose the proposal from the Munich architect Andreas Meck, considering it suitable for both public visits and private mourning.
The memorial
The memorial has more in common with a video installation than a conventional memorial. It is a 
publicly accessible rectangular concrete structure, 41 metres long, eight metres wide and ten metres high, covered by a bronze mantle, reminiscent of the identity tags that are cut in half when a soldier dies. Inside, there is a black contemplation room with an inscription commemorating the members of the Bundeswehr who have given their lives for peace, justice and freedom. The installation projects the names of the fallen – each for five seconds – so that they are no longer anonymous, but have their individuality restored to them.
This means the names are listed individually, but only briefly displayed, unlike the names engraved on traditional war memorials. This is to consciously distance the memorial from hero worship and the glorification of war, and to emphasise the transitory nature of being.
The Bendlerblock, seat of the Federal Minister of Defence, also contains the Memorial to the German Resistance, commemorating the attempted assassination of Hitler on 20 July 1944.

It is a moment of remembrance – to Wilhelm and Karl Liebknecht, to Rosa Luxemburg and to many other well-known Berliners who were buried at the Zentralfriedhof Friedrichsfelde.

From a paupers’ graveyard to to a socialist cemetery
The cemetery, originally to be known as the Städtische Gemeindefriedhof für Berlin but then renamed Central-Friedhof Friedrichsfelde, was opened on 21 May 1881. All the cemeteries inside the city had reached the limits of their capacity. The Central Cemetery was open to people of all confessions and social strata. The costs of the headstones were often paid for by the city – it was a cemetery for the poor. Because of its attractive design by Herrmann Mächtig, a pupil of Lenné, wealthy bourgeois families began to use the cemetery from the beginning of the 20th century.

The cemetery became famous with the funeral of the Wilhelm Liebknecht. An estimated 100,000 to 150,000 people came to pay their last respects to the social democrat on 12 August 1900. Ever since then, the cemetery has been used as the burial place for prominent figures in the German worker’s movement. These include his son Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg, both murdered in 1919 after the Spartacist uprising. The young Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, later architect of the Neue Nationalgalerie, designed a monument to the revolution in their honour. It did not last long – the Nazis destroyed it in 1935 along with the graves around it.

Today, thousands of people come to the Socialist Memorial at the cemetery every year in January to commemorate the history of the workers’ movement.

Tour of the cemetery
There are signs indicating the route for a tour of the cemetery site. From the main entrance on Gudrunstraße it first leads to the Socialist Memorial. Twelve panels tell the story of the cemetery and the biographies of well-known figures buried here. On the pergola path, one of the graves is that of the film director Konrad Wolf. The route continues past the resting place of the architect Simon Archenhold, co-founder of the observatory in Treptow, to the ceremonial hall. The chapel was designed by Herrmann Blankenstein. Arriving at the other end of the cemetery you come to the place where Mies van der Rohe’s monument to the revolution once stood.

After the fall of the Wall, it once again became a thoroughfare and home to some of the rather different and creative projects that are typical of Berlin.
A Street of many faces
The Hafenbar at Chauseestraße 20, for example, had been an extensive amusement arcade during GDR times; its new operators turned it into popular karaoke club. Sarah Wiener, who has since become a star chef with a reputation across Germany, set up her first restaurant ""Speisezimmer"" in the industrial building at Chausseestraße 8. The former workshops for the Opernwerkstätten (state opera house) are used for ever-changing dining, art and fashion events. And the Erika Hess ice rink at the northern end of Chauseestraße will be showcased in Summer 2014 Berlin Fashion Week. The street that has so many different aspects is facing another change: The German Federal Intelligence Service, the BND, is building its new headquarters on the site of the former World Youth Stadium. Designed by Kleihues & Kleihues, this building complex will have thousands of windows and be decorated with two artificial palm trees. Construction is largely complete and by the end of 2016, approximately 4,000 employees of the BND to move in here.",,,,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/chausseestrasse,,,,

Aircraft were once built at Johannisthal, the European centre for aviation in the early 20th century. Ernst Grade, Melli Beese, Anthony Fokker, the Wright brothers and other pioneers designed and tested their innovative aircraft here. After civil aviation was moved to Tempelhof in 1923, Johannisthal was used during the Third Reich to build military equipment. It continued to be used for military purposes until the 1980s.

From military base to place for relaxation
You can barely recognize the park’s past in today’s nature reserve. Planes no longer land here. Instead, the flight and ground personnel are butterflies, bees, plants and many other species of flora and fauna worthy of protection.

Varied landscape design
Surrounded by stone walls, the almost 26 hectares of the former airfield form the nature reserve at the core of the park. A partially elevated trail goes around the nature reserve. It provides a view of the green zone and uses displays to teach about the history of the place and the animal and plant world, including articles on “botanical immigrants” such as Russian chamomile. The nature reserve is also one of the three main lark breeding areas in inner-city Berlin, which was a reason for its establishment as a nature reserve. Around the nature reserve are 30 “city zones” which make up the exercise park. Here are numerous green spaces for sport, play and leisure, including a skate park, a beach volleyball court, playgrounds and lawns. Some of the zones are dedicated to relaxing and discovering nature.",,,,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/former-johannisthal-air-field-nature-park,,,,

In the period between 21 and 26 June 1933, storm troopers in Berlin and its southern suburb of Köpenick dragged off and abused several hundred people with tremendous brutality, with at least 23 dead. The arrests were coordinated through the gaol at the Köpenick district court, which also served as a place for torture. The arrests were triggered by the nationwide bans on the right-wing German National People’s Party and the left-wing Socialist Party of Germany. In the course of the terror campaign, SPD member Anton Schmaus shot and killed three storm troopers in self-defence, which led to a further escalation of the violence. Joseph Goebbels, who in his role as Gauleiter (Nazi party leader) for Berlin had played a key role in the plans for unleashing the terror campaign on the capital, then used the storm troopers’ deaths as part of his propaganda machine and stylised them as “martyrs” for the Nazi cause.

Bosepark was built in 1914 by the district of Tempelhof. In addition to walks and a charming playground, it also offers an insight into Tempelhof in days gone by. If you look a little closer, you will find weathered grave stones on nearby Stolbergstraße.
Lehnepark is right next to the churchyard of Tempelhof’s picturesque old  village church. Along with the many old graves, you will also come across a  memorial stone to remember Berlin’s victims of the 2004 tsunami in Southeast Asia. One of the botanical highlights that the park has to offer is a real bald cypress growing on the edge of a small pond.
We then move to the connecting Alter Park which covers an area of almost  4 hectares. The elliptically shaped lake, formed by ice from a glacier, is the most dominant feature of this park.  Alter Park was acquired by the district as far back as 1907 and opened just one year later as a community park.  Today, the park still boasts gentle slopes, a large lake and a pretty abundance of shrubs and trees.
Looking across the wide road of Tempelhofer Damm, it appears as if the green corridor has come to an end, but if you look further, beyond the town hall car park, it reappears as Franckepark, developing further into woods with a very special attraction: a large deer  enclosure is located in the centre of  the park, offering education about  nature for city children. It is great to watch from the two elevated viewing platforms.
Franckepark is named after its founder, arboretum owner Theodor Francke. Together with Jonathan Kaehler, he planned the park which was finally built in 1875 with features that even included a sledding hill for his children. In the 1920s, the park was redesigned. The existing trees remained and continue to create an enchanted forest atmosphere right in the middle of this city park.           ",,,,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/green-trail-tempelhof-schoneberg,,,,

Discover arts such as sculpture and painting, alongside design, architecture and even performance art - all forms are represented here. Experience the quiet and tranquil atmosphere in the house, which hosts up to five exhibitions annually. This also includes themed exhibitions, featuring the work of multiple artists.
Tranquil and inspiring: encounters with international art
The museum opens in 1946, immediately after the war. Located in the countryside, away from the busy city centre, it develops as an exciting centre for international contemporary arts. Today, the house welcomes creative talent which has pushed Berlin up the ranks of international art. Supported by the district council, the art centre is run by a sponsor association. One of the unusual aspects of the centre's approach is putting reflection, sensuality and inspiration at the heart of everything. This includes personal contact between artists and visitors. Start your visit by taking the direct path to the entrance of the Haus am Waldsee. The house, built in 1923 for textile manufacturer Hermann Knobloch, still has a cosy, rural feel. Tony Cragg's bright yellow sculpture entitled ""Outspan"" sits outside and gives an indication of what you can expect to find within. Pass through the attractive doorway, flanked by columns, and enter a house full of surprises. Inside, the intimate atmosphere aids your enjoyment of the art. The rooms are flooded with light, and are similar to living rooms. Maybe this helps the contemporary art come into its own. Take a walk through the villa's garden, where you'll find more sculptures and contemporary works of art. Or take a rest at the in-house café and let the impressions of what you have seen sink in.

Dorotheenstädtische cemetery on Chausseestrasse. ",,,"The grave stones and memorial plaques here read like a ""Who's Who"" of the intellectual elite of Germany. Since 2016, a minor sensation has been hiding in the hitherto inconspicuous cemetery chapel. A generous private donation by a Berlin citizen has enabled the installation of an art feature created by US light artist James Turrell.
Light, pure light
James Turrell (b 1943) is one of the most important artists of our time. His entire oeuvre focuses on the exploration of the many facets of natural and artificial light. He penetrates to the limits of perception. In his light rooms, the architecture seems dematerialised and relieved of its severity, and the visitor instantly experiences the presence of pure light. Turrell's work in the Dorotheenstädtischer cemetery chapel is especially tuned to the time the sun sets. Tours and visits are possible at these times without pre-booking.
The ""Who's Who"" of the intellectual elite
During the day, the Dorotheenstädtische cemetery offers a walk through the intellectual history of Germany. Examples of those buried in Berlin's famous celebrity cemetery are the philosophers Hegel and Fichte, writers Bertolt Brecht, Heinrich Mann, Johannes R. Becher, Arnold Zweig and Anna Seghers, director Heiner Müller, architects Stüler and Schinkel, artist John Heartfield, actress Helene Weigel and former Federal President Johannes Rau.

A 1688 map of the city shows Jüdenstraße continuing to the Marienkirchen on Alexanderplatz.
Historically Significant, but Inconspicuous
Jüdenstraße meanders as a small inconspicuous side street between the Rotes Rathaus and the Rathauspassagen, so tucked away that you would have a hard time imagining this as one of the oldest streets in the city. This is partly due to the fact that, except for the Rathaus, the Altes Stadthaus and the Neues Stadthaus, hardly any pre-1945 building in this area remains. The rebuilding of the city during the GDR period changed the old street layout and general appearance of Berlin's historic city centre.
The Großer Jüdenhof (Large Jewish Quarter)
The Jüdenstraße is named after the Großer Jüdenhof, an Old Berlin residential quarter for Jews dating back to the 13th century. In the aftermath of Luther's polemics against the Jews, Jews were expelled from many cities in the 16th century. This included the Jews who had been residing in Berlin's Großer Jüdenhof. After having been restored and renovated in the 1930s, the Großer Jüdenhof was destroyed by bombing in WWII. The Großer Jüdenhof is part of a neighbourhood called the Klosterviertel (Monastery Quarter) after a former Franciscan monastery once located here. The neighbourhood is slated to be rebuilt in the future. Prior to the rebuilding, excavations were undertaken of the Großer Jüdenhof which have brought historic artefacts to light, such as the remains of a synagogue and a Jewish mikvah (ritual bath) and various hand tools.",,,History,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/judenstrasse-und-judenhof,,,,

Covering seven storeys and 6,000 m², the Kühlhaus offers space for exhibitions, dance performances, readings, concerts, and plays. Fashion shows, for example, love the Kühlhaus for its popular Berlin look.
Cold storage
At the beginning of the 20th century, there was a growing demand for fresh produce in the heaving metropolis of Berlin. What was Europe's largest cold storage warehouse at the time was opened Luckenwalder Straße, at the same time as the elevated tracks at the Gleisdreieck. Even if the building's exterior might hearken to the typical brick Gothic of the region, it was the epitome of contemporary construction on the inside, with steel skeleton and reinforced concrete.
Even today, the listed building surprises guests with the contrast of an imposing red brick façade and the plain concrete interior with steel beams. After German unification, the Kühlhaus was long in danger of being demolished. But citizens organised to prevent this and instead started its restoration. They intentionally retained the unfinished character of a construction site in order to provide as much open space as possible for new creative impulses.
The Gleisdreieck Neighbourhood
The neighbourhood around Gleisdreieck has developed rapidly in recent years. The newly opened 
park quickly became a favourite of many Berliners, who come here to lounge in the grass, play a game of basketball, or ride their bicycles.

Silesian marble and red brick lend the palace its romantic aura, although the lakeshore location doesn't hurt, either.",,,"The Marble House stands in Potsdam's Neuer Garten along with the later Cecilienhof Palace, which stands directly on the shore.

The only surviving early neo-classical palace in Prussia

Berlin and the surrounding state of Brandenburg reflect their former role as the seat of the kings of Prussia, later to become the German kaisers. The palaces across the region are truly special, with each palace a unique architectural statement. The Prussians were creative and kept up with the latest fashions in their building projects. Charlottenburg's Rococo style and Cecilienhof's Neo-Gothic allure are just two examples.

King Frederick William II. asked Carl von Gontard to build a two-storey cubic building topped with a round cupola in the Neuer Garten, making it the first and only royal palace in Prussia to be built in the early Neo-Classical style. The rectangular side wings were added a little later when the king found the palace too small for his needs.

Transitional home for future kings and emperors

In the 1830s, Prince Wilhelm., later to become the first kaiser of Germany, moved into the palace with his wife Augusta. But they stayed only briefly, as they waited for the completion of their own palace at Babelsberg. Another Prince Wilhelm, later Kaiser Wilhelm II., also spent some years of his life in the Marmorpalais, residing there from 1881 until his accession to the throne in 1888. The last royals to live at Marmorpalais were the eldest son of Kaiser Wilhelm II. and his wife Cecilie. Both moved in to the palace in 1904, although they relocated to the Cecilienhof across the garden thirteen years later.

Casino Royal

As you might expect, World War II had its impact on the palace. An incendiary bomb hit the north wing and a grenade damaged the main building. The former palace was turned into a casino and an army museum after the war.

Discover the highlights of the castle

A view from the terrace to the right and you'll see what looks like a small ruined temple. This folly actually housed the palace kitchens. This was designed by Carl Gotthard Langhans, who also designed Berlin's iconic Brandenburg Gate. The prepared foods were taken by underground tunnel to the royal dining room known as the Grotto Hall. The Grotto Hall is another spectacular room in the palace. On warm summer evenings, when the doors were opened wide out onto the terrace, the king would dine here with his guests. Another marvel is the palace's extensive collection of Wedgwood china. There are also Nibelung-related motifs to be found throughout the palace.

The street named Alt-Marienfelde (Old Marienfelde) is true to its name and takes you directly to the village green with the village church.
Marienfelde Church
This sanctuary, along with those in Biesdorf and Karow, is the oldest village church in Berlin. This charming little church was built of rugged field stone on a former burial ground somewhere between 1220–1240. The building is late Romanesque in style with some early Gothic additions. The walls are between 110 and 175 cm thick and serve as evidence of the church's auxiliary function as a village fortress. Marienfelde, like similar settlements in historic Mariendorf and Rixdorf, was part of the protective ring of settlements built along the Teltow by the Knights Templar, who, incidentally, gave today's Tempelhof district its name.
Village Green and Manor House
Old farmhouses are grouped around the village green, but what stands out is the manor house built by Adolf Kiepert to look like an Italian villa with towers, and which has been home to a laboratory for the Federal Health Office since the 1970s. Adjacent is the Gutspark Marienfelde, also designed by Kiepert.

Situated directly at Alexanderplatz, the MeMu dares to go beyond the structure of the human body – it shows what connects us, what keeps us upright, in motion, what makes us laugh and what makes us love. It shows the complexity, resilience, and vulnerability of the human body and describes organ functions and common diseases in an easily understood way. Plastinates in lifelike poses allow a direct connection with the viewers own body. But the MeMu is more than just an anatomy exhibition that shows the complexity of the human body's inner structure: A tour invites visitors to a gain a deeply touching and inspiring encounter with life, through intense awareness of one's own physical body. Visitors are invited to take stock of their lives through contemplation and mediation in a considered approach to discover what it means to be human and what makes us human. The specimens on display were preserved through Plastination, the preservation process invented by Dr. Gunther von Hagens in 1977 at the University of Heidelberg. They stem from people who have consented to donate their bodies for the education of medical professionals and the general public after their death. Audio guides are available in German and English and enrich the visit to a further dimension. Clear explanations, amazing facts and more information about the plastinates is accessed by individual users at thier own pace. The two hour program is designed for non-medical professionals, and is included in the ticket price.

Additional material is available to download for free on the MuMu website to prepare for and to follow up your visit.

Courting light, trapping it, throwing illusions into the showroom. The artists’ choice of special materials supports their staging of space. It allows for an unusual play with space through reflection. The artists are less interested in celebrating their extraordinary working materials. They take them for granted. But the use of materials such as glue, concrete, silk or porcelain enables the beholder to perceive the enclosed space or the object in sight in a unique way. The artists condense unusual materials on surfaces. In doing so, they often employ traditional techniques: painting, drawing, sculpture, photography. However, the techniques are applied in a contemporary fashion: drawing becomes three-dimensional; the glove seemingly thrown about is really a carefully wrought ceramic sculpture; the piece of cloth on which an object is painted, turns out to be itself a painting; the photo is more precisely a painting, though using light instead of paint. Illusion and reflection. The artists entice. Maybe because they combine traditional techniques with unusual materials. They guide the beholder’s view to the depths and the complexity of their work.

King Friedrich Wilhelm III planned the Neuer Pavillon in the park of Charlottenburg Palace in 1824/25 and had it built for his second wife Countess Auguste von Harrach. After his extraordinarily popular queen Luise died 1810 to the great grief of the public, King Friedrich Wilhelm III remarried 14 years later. However, as Auguste was of a lower social rank, it was a morganatic marriage, which meant she had fewer rights and was not eligible to be called Queen. And so the summerhouse was not a magnificent palace, but a modest villa, which suited the more down-to-earth tastes of the king. However, the pair never lived together in the villa; it served instead as a private retreat for the king.

The villa

The villa, which is also known as the Schinkel-Pavillon, was inspired by the Neoclassical villas that the king had seen in Italy. He commissioned Karl Friedrich Schinkel, Prussia’s most famous architect, to plan it. Schinkel designed a two-storey, plain white villa right beside the river Spree. A columned loggia and green window shutters are prominent features. The iron balcony that runs all around it is based on an Italian model, the Villa Chiatamone. Schinkel also designed the new rooms in the interior with simple, reserved elegance.

 

The pavilion was almost completely demolished by an air raid in 1943, and the interior decorations were destroyed by fire. It was rebuilt between 1957 and 1970 and in 2011, following extensive renovations, a new permanent exhibition was opened.

The exhibition in the Neuer Pavillon

A visit to the Neuer Pavillon is like taking a walk though past times. In its rooms, the original furnishings of a summerhouse in Prussia come to life. Paintings by well-known Prussian artists such as Caspar David Friedrich, Karl Blechen and Eduard Gaertner and sculptures by Christian Daniel Rauch decorate the rooms.

Particularly interesting is the exhibition on Schinkel’s work as an architect and painter, which also includes a tea table that he designed himself, and on which he designed many of his most famous buildings.

This separate royal palace contains two apartments for the king and two large ballrooms. Subsequent generations of Prussia’s rulers also left their mark. For example, in 1796, Friedrich Wilhelm II (1744-1797) set up a summer apartment on the ground floor and winter apartment upstairs, both in a Neo-Classical style. Friedrich Wilhelm III (1770-1840) and his wife Luise (1776-1810) also lived in the New Wing. The rooms of the Royal Apartments, the White Hall and the Golden Gallery are now once again open to the public. The vestibule of the New Wing was already used to display sculpture around the turn of the last century; it once again houses marble and plaster sculptures by Johann Gottfried (1764-1850), Ridolfo Schadow (1786-1822) and Christian Daniel Rauch’s (1777-1857) second reclining figure of Queen Luise. The latter was originally in the Antiquities Temple at Sanssouci in Potsdam. The sculptures are outstanding examples of the development of Berlin sculpture modelled after Roman antiquity and Romanticism. Also returning to the New Wing are French paintings of the 18th century, including Antoine Watteau’s (1684-1721) “Embarkation to Cythera” and “The Shop Sign of Gersaint”, considered one of the key works of its century.","Opening hours (additional information)

The park stretches like a spread-out sail over nearly one kilometre from Invalidenstraße to Schwindsuchtbrücke, thus connecting the area around Ackerstraße in the former eastern part of the city with the area around Schwartzkopffstraße in the old West Berlin. In this manner, the wound inflicted on Berlin by the Wall is healed by 5.5 hectares (13 acres) of tangible urban nature that has developed here in the last 20 years. The Nordbahnhof Park is an area steeped in tradition defined by three layers of history. The former border installations of the Berlin Wall are to be found alongside the remains of the railway installations of the old Stettin Railway Station (a hub of activity in pre-war times), and – as the youngest layer – an urban wasteland, which is being reclaimed by a rapidly growing nature.
History and nature in the same place are waiting not only to be discovered but protected as well. The park is protected by fences and is entered via gates – just as in the classic garden designs. Behind these narrow, channel-like entrances lies a kind of “lost world”.

The memorial centre at Plötzensee is a place of silent remembrance for the nearly 3000 people from Germany and abroad were were executed here by the Nazis.

Plötzensee prison
Plötzensee prison was built between 1868 and 1879 on part of the Plötzensee manor estate in Tegel Forest. From 1933, it was increasingly used for interrogating and executing political prisoners. Many of the prisoners were condemned by Sondergerichte, political courts set up by the Nazis, such as the Volksgerichtshof, or People’s Court, which they established in 1934.

Between 1933 and 1945, 2891 people were sentenced to death and executed at Plötzensee prison, including members of the Red Orchestra, participants in the failed coup of 20 July 1944, Czech resistance fighters and members of the Kreisau Circle. Almost half of those executed were not Germans. All of them died by guillotine in the prison yard, or, after 1942, were hanged in the execution room.

Gedenkstätte Plötzensee
In 1951, the city government established a memorial centre at Plötzensee, which was officially opened a year later. It was dedicated to the Victims of Hitler’s Dictatorship from 1933 to 1945. The room where the executions took place is now a room of remembrance. The heavy beam with the five hooks gives visitors a nightmarish impression of those times and has not lost any of its effect today.

In the room next door, an exhibition documents the Nazi court system. It shows the individual fates and life stories of people who were persecuted and killed by the Nazis. The memorial centre is run by a dedicated foundation called the Stiftung Gedenkstätte Deutscher Widerstand.

Not far from the memorial centre is a housing estate called the Paul-Hertz-Siedlung, where there is a church built as a memorial to the victims of Plötzensee. It features artwork by Alfred Hrdlicka, with twelve panels depicting the murder and death at Plötzensee as a danse macabre.","Opening hours (additional information)

Inventive Reconstruction
World War II and the Wall had left a wasteland on the block bounded by Schützenstraße, Markgrafenstraße, Zimmerstraße und Charlottenstraße. The challenge was to create new architecture that would relate to the historic Friedrichstadt cityscape. Rossi decided to reflect the historic division of the site into smaller plots by designing the individual parts of the structure with several multi-coloured façades and roofs.

The Raum der Stille is designed for precisely that: calm and relaxation. And all that at one of Berlin’s busiest attractions.

Silence in the middle of the city
Relaxation, prayer, remembrance, meditation and contemplation – those are precisely the activities that the Raum der Stille (Room of Silence) is ideal for. Quite simply, it is there for anyone who needs time to think in a peaceful and neutral atmosphere. Anyone is welcome to spend some time quietly there. The Raum der Stille also symbolises tolerance among people – without violence, hate or xenophobia. The 30-square-metre room is modestly furnished, the most eye-catching item being the woven wall tapestry by Ritta Hager, entitled Light that Penetrates the Darkness. In contrast to the Raum der Stille itself, the anteroom is brightly painted. The walls are a calming blue. This is how the relaxation stage begins before visitors enter the silent room where they can sink further into their thoughts.

An American inspiration
The idea of the Room of Silence was inspired by a meditation room set up in New York in 1957. The UN General Secretary at the time, the Swede Dag Hammarskjöld, had a sparsely furnished room set up, free of any religious decorations. In 1988, the idea of a room like this, but open to the public, was picked up in the GDR. After reunification, the idea took hold and a group initiators formed in 1993. The most challenging thing at first was to find a suitable place for the room, because if possible, they wanted it to be somewhere on the former border. Finally, on October 1994, the Raum der Stille opened in the northern gatehouse of the Brandenburg Gate.

Every day since then it has had more than a hundred visitors from many different places and religions, wanting to take some time off from the noisy and pulsating metropolis.","Opening hours

Classicism and the new desire for antiquity
The Classicist era of the 19th century provides a great demand for replicas of ancient art. Citizens and nobles, mostly in Italy, acquire these replicas. Prussian art lovers, however, spend their money in Berlin. At the same time, the arts, science and industry are strengthened after the Napoleonic wars. In 1819, King Friedrich Wilhelm III establishes the Royal Prussian Institute of Replicas. At this time, the development of museums in Berlin grows – in part thanks to the excavations by Heinrich Schliemann in Troy. In 1891, the replicas of the Staatliche Museen move to new premises in Charlottenburg, where it is still to be found on its 200th anniversary. It is difficult to believe what cultural treasures are hidden behind the sober façade of this industrial building, but as you pass the threshold, you will be amazed: in a modern ambience, you will meet impressive busts of historic personalities, sleeping beauties and other art-history classics. Moulds are stored in the archive on long metal shelves, waiting to be brought to life. Spatulas, brushes, tools and colours add to the creativity of this space. Twice monthly, art-lovers have the opportunity to experience the art-history workshop.

",,,"The Ribbeck-Haus did not receive its name from the noble Brandenburg family immortalized in literature by Theodor Fontane, as one might easily surmise. Instead, it was commissioned in 1624 by Privy Counsellor Hans Georg von Ribbeck. The project involved merging two older gabled houses into a single structure with the slope of the roof and the eaves facing the street (known in German as a ""Traufenhaus""). The location was well chosen as Breite Straße was a distinguished residential area for wealthy merchants and prominent citizens of the day. Today, the Ribbeck-Haus is the only Renaissance-era house left standing in Berlin. Striking are the typical Renaissance, ornate gables with helical volutes and the ornamental arched portal. Although the Ribbeck-Haus today is a listed building, what you see is not the original state of the building: it has been modified several times. For example, in 1804, the Renaissance gables were removed to make room for a third storey, evidenced by the different layout of the smaller windows. The gables were then placed on top of the higher structure. In World War II, the Ribbeck-Haus suffered severe damage. The house's arched portal is a replica and the façade was rebuilt in a simpler form. But, with a little imagination, you can imagine the town houses that once lined Breite Straße going to the Berlin Stadtschloß (City Palace). The Ribbeck-Haus is now home to the Zentrum für Berlin-Studien (Centre for Berlin Studies) of the Central and Regional Library Berlin.

Compensating with a rural idyll
Because the highway project was paving over some natural areas, a generously-sized park was developed on neighbouring property over a two-year period of construction. Some 2,500 trees were planted where the Berlin Wall once ran through the Neukölln and Treptow-Köpenick districts. Where else in a city can you tramp about paddocks, orchards and fields?

Between March and December 1933, the SA imprisons Jews and people opposing the regime. In these dark cellars in the Tempelhof-Schöneberg area of Berlin, you truly feel the suffering of the detainees.

1933 - A year of mass arrests in Berlin
Hitler sweeps to power in January 1933, and the SA soon begin to raid, making many arrests. A temporary prison is established in a former railway barracks. By December of that year, thousands are in prison, some of them for months. Figures show that around 30 of them die after ill-treatment. Some of them are high ranking members of socialist and communist parties such as Fritz Fränkel, Franz Czeminski and Erich Gentsch. In 2011, a memorial opens with plans to create a comprehensive exhibition. In 2013, the first permanent exhibition and visitor archive to document the building opens. Step back into 1933. As you enter the 19th century brick building and make your way down into the gloomy cellars, you'll see cold corridors with heavy wooden doors, all lit by flickering lights. On the walls there are panels documenting the history of the Nazi party, along with drawings and graffiti created by prisoners – still visible today. In one of the rooms at the rear of the barracks you'll discover the fates of people imprisoned there; their names are projected in the dark room as a light installation. The archive room gives an insight into the prisoner's lives with their biographies. The exhibition also details the history of the National Socialist justice system, the Sturmabteilung and the creation of the SA Prison Papestraße.

Top things to see
The well-preserved cells from 1933.
Archive room with information and documents related to prisoners.
Information and photographs about the role of the Sturmabteilung.
Memorial room with light installation.
Original boilers from the 1920s.

Urban history in this area of Berlin
Papestraße is not only home to the SA prison, it is also where you will find the history of Tempelhof. Follow the signposted trail over the former military area and stop at a total of 14 points of interest. Among other things, these tell the story of the building of the railway by troops during the Franco-Prussian War. You also pass a huge concrete cylinder which dates from 1942. The cylinder was designed to test the weight-bearing qualities of the ground with the aim of later constructing a mysterious ""Building T"" (a triumphal arch for the fallen soldiers of the First World War). This was never to be, and the large cylinder is all that is left of the Nazi plan to build the world capital of Germania. Views over the area are best from the adjacent lookout tower.","Opening hours

Today a place for thinking, research, and experimentation. The silent green Cultural Quater is home to such groups as Music Board Berlin, which supports the pop music scene in Berlin and helps strengthen its cultural and economic reputation locally and internationally. !K7 Records, a label known for artists such as Nick Cave, Einstürzende Neubauten and the DJ-Kicks series with Carl Craig, and Kruder & Dorfmeister, is also here, as is the foundation dedicated to the work of the late filmmaker, author, and film essayist Harun Farocki and the film archive of Arsenal - Institut für Film und Videokunst e.V. as well as Pictoplasma - agency for character design, Art Space Savvy Contemporary and Luxoom media agency.
Impressive and beautiful
The most striking rooms of the 1911 structure is the domed, the former ceremonial hall and, with quite the architectural contrast, the underground hall made of concrete. If you’ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing a concert in the domed hall with its atmospheric intimacy, you’re sure to remember this strong acoustic and visual experience for a long time. In addition to the domed and concrete halls, the silent green also features wings built around the sunny courtyard and the “cube”, a room for seminars and yoga, Pilates, Shiatsu, etc. classes.
Delicious and a bit odd
Charlie Huber and his team serve up daily specials, coffee, and sweets in the on-site canteen with adjoining garden. Plantagenstraße 30 is the entrance to the Galerie Patrick Ebensperger, showing contemporary art since 2013.
Always a step ahead of its time
The listed former crematorium in Wedding was built in the early 20th century as the first crematorium in the city. Cremation at the time was considered a sign of progress, secularization, environmental awareness, and concern for hygiene. The Wedding crematorium sits in the middle of the district’s first cemetery which opened in 1828. The centrepiece of the building is the 17 metre high octagonal funeral hall. The ensemble is completed by the adjoining wings surrounding the octagonal courtyard. After the underground sections of the crematorium were enlarged in 1997, the city decided to close it in 2002. 2013 saw the beginning of the renovation and remodelling for the silent green Cultural Quarter, in close cooperation with the Heritage Office.
Reading history
The adjacent silent green columbarium is an oasis of peace and tranquillity. It contains the family graves of Russian exiles, the grave of Siegfried Ochs, the Prussian interior minister during the writing of the Weimar Constitution, and the tomb of the Gutmann banking family who founded Dresdner Bank. Ida Siekmann, the first person killed trying to cross the Berlin Wall, was cremated here.
Other interesting places in Wedding
A memorial plaque can be seen at the spot where Ida Siekmann fell trying to abseil from the house in Bernauer Straße over the Wall to the West just one week after the Wall was erected.

Between 1906 and 1914, Royal Garden Director Fritz Zahn and Horticultural  Inspector Rudolf Korte transformed what was once marshy lowlands into  a 17-hectare landscape park after the district Steglitz purchased the land from two families for half a million gold marks. At that time, Steglitz was the biggest district in Prussia, with a population of 80,000, and was not incorporated into Berlin until 1920. The planners designed the park as a recreation area for the people living in the nearby tenements. The music pavilion built in 1958 is still an attraction today and the venue for free, outdoor classical, jazz and song concerts on summer weekends.

The park opens with a central axis that leads to a splendid fountain and a rose garden surrounded by hornbeam trees. From here, you can discover lawns, ponds and, above all, the weeping willows. One special feature is Goebenteich, the only pond in the park that is completely sourced from groundwater. It is located in the part of the park that is west of Sedanstraße.

The section of the park between Al­brechtstraße and Sedanstraße is a veritable paradise for children, with playgrounds, spacious grass play areas and ponds where children can watch the ducks and other water birds; there are hills to roll down and willow trees  to hide under. There is also a traffic school and a mini-golf course in the shade of the high-rise building on Albrecht­straße.

When Stadtpark Steglitz celebrated its centenary anniversary in 2014, the park was given a new fence along with the renovation work that was already necessary. Soil was replaced and plants  replenished in the magnificent rose garden, trees were replaced, paths were mended and the playground next to Goebenwiese was redesigned with  a pirate theme.",,,,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/stadtpark-steglitz,,,,

To stop this from happening, in 1996 the artist Gunter Demnig brought a project to the pavements of Oranienstraße and Dresdener Straße which he had started in Cologne and which still continues today. Demnig installed – at the time, illegally – 51 of what he called stolpersteine (“stumbling stones”) among the cobblestones to commemorate the victims of the Shoah who lived in those streets.
Stolpersteine – an art project for Europe.
Since then, Demnig and fellow artists have laid countless stumbling stones in Germany and other countries in Europe. Each one is ten centimetres square and made of polished brass. The inscriptions begin “Here lived ...”, followed by the name and year of birth of the former resident, and then the name of a concentration camp, such as Auschwitz or Theresienstadt. Right at the bottom is the date of death. The artists make the objects by hand, and they are financed by private donations. The decision not to mass-produce them is intentional.
Originally intended for victims of the Shoah, the project has since been extended to commemorate homosexuals, Sinti and Roma, Jehovah’s Witnesses, those vilified and persecuted as “antisocial elements”, and people who took part in the resistance. The stones give the victims their names back and thus help make the atrocities committed in Germany’s name more visible.
At the same time, they show the exclusion, dispossession, persecution and imprisonment that took in the middle of the city in full view of their neighbours. The art project thus contradicts the often-heard excuse that no-one knew what was really going on.
Stolpersteine all around Berlin
In Berlin the stones can be found outside many house entrances and driveways, commemorating the fates of people who lived in those houses. You suddenly realise that an entire family was exterminated when you stumble across six, seven or more stones outside a building. The stones constantly force you to stop and think.
A list of the stones laid in Berlin can be found on the project’s website.",,,"Memorials

Seven boys and girls represent the Jewish children of the 1930s. The arrangement of the group reflects the contrasting fate of the children in the Nazi era. Five figures in grey bronze look to one side, symbolising the suffering of those deported to concentration camps to meet an early demise. Two lighter bronze figures, however, gaze in the other direction. They represent those Jewish children whose lives were saved by the Kindertransport to England. More than two million children lost their lives from 1933 to 1945 through the tyranny of the Nazis.

London stockbroker Nicholas Winton, moved by the fate of Jewish refugees, worked with his fellow Britons to bring the first rescued children to the UK. These Kindertransporte were an attempt to protect the youngest victims of the Nazi dictatorship. These rescue missions allowed some 10,000 Jewish children from Germany, Austria, Poland and Czechoslovakia to escape deportation and find refuge in children's homes or with English families in London. The first train left Berlin's Friedrichstraße station with 196 children on board on 30 November 1938.

Berlin",52.481473,13.4096031,Memorial,1,FALSE,Turkish Cemetery,Germany’s first Muslim cemetery,,,"Ali Aziz Efendi was the author of the Muhayyelât, a fantastical collection of tales from the Orient. He brought his culture to Berlin when he became the Ottoman Empire’s first permanent ambassador to Prussia. In 1798 he was buried on what was then known as the Tempelhofer Feldmark. In subsequent years, other Turkish envoys in Berlin were laid to rest there. Eventually, in the mid-19th century, Wilhelm I granted the Turkish community a plot of land in Neukölln to use as a burial place, and for a long time it remained the only Muslim cemetery in Germany.

The history of the cemetery
The Türkischer Friedhof Berlin is the oldest burial place for adherents of Islam in Germany. Inaugurated in 1866, its entrance was once adorned by a portal in the Moorish style. In the middle of the cemetery stands an obelisk commemorating the ambassador Ali Aziz Efendi and other envoys. In the First World War, the Ottoman Empire fought on Germany’s side and fallen Turkish soldiers were buried at the cemetery, since when it has also borne the name Şehitlik, meaning ‘martyrs’. The Şehitlik mosque directly beside it was built between 1999 and 2005 and took its name from the cemetery.

Famous personalities buried at the cemetery
Since its dedication in 1866, the cemetery has been open to all Berlin Muslims, no matter what their origins are. Not only Turks, but Arabs and Persians of Muslim faith were buried here in the 20th century. 150 graves are preserved today. As well as Turkish politicians and diplomats, those laid to rest at the cemetery include businessmen, writers and freedom fighters.

Because Islam does not permit graves to be removed after a certain time to make room for new burials, the cemetery eventually ran out of space – not least since until a few years ago, it was the only Muslim cemetery in Germany. Because of the need for more space, the Turkish-Islamic Union was granted part of the cemetery in Gatow, which is still used today. However, the ceremonies still take place in Neukölln.","Opening hours (additional information)

Berlin",52.4252712,13.2084451,Memorial,1,FALSE,Waldfriedhof Zehlendorf,The VIP cemetery in the south of Berlin: many famous Berliners are buried in the Waldfriedhof Zehlendorf.,,,"This quiet cemetery in the middle of a pine forest is the final resting place of around 44,000 Berliners. The graves lie in a gently rolling landscape amongst the lawns and the shady trees of the forest. The cemetery seems to be part of the landscape itself, which means every visit to the Waldfriedhof is also a nature walk.

Graves of honour at the Waldfriedhof
There are currently around 44 graves of honour at the cemetery. Many of the people buried here are still well known for their contribution to Berlin life and the city’s self-image. The former Berlin mayors Ernst Reuter, Otto Suhr and Willy Brandt steered the fate of the city. The theatre directors Götz Friedrich, Ulrich Schamoni, Boleslaw Barlog and Erwin Piscator enriched Berlin’s cultural life. The film director Helmut Käutner made Heinz Rühmann immortal as the Captain of Köpenick. The buildings of the architects Hermann Henselmann and Hans Scharoun such as the Philharmonie shaped Berlin’s cityscape. And every West Berliner knew Edith Hancke and her unmistakable voice. The TV series Praxis Bülowbogen with Günter Pfitzmann showed the unglamorous but authentic Berlin of the 1980s, as did Die Wicherts von nebenan with Ekkehard Fritsch, whose grave is also at the cemetery. Boxer Bubi Scholz gained fame far beyond Berlin. And of course, there’s Hildegard Knef, who once sang of her longing for Kurfürstendamm.

History of the cemetery
The Waldfriedhof was established between 1931 and 1933 and extended in the late 1940s. The architects Sergius Ruegenberg and Wolf von Möllendorf designed the simple ceremonial halls with large window façades that emphasise the transition to nature. 1183 Italian soldiers killed in Berlin were laid to rest in the cemetery of honour which was established in 1953.","Opening hours (additional information)

Because to move the digital paddles requires nothing else but the power of their thoughts. What sounds like science fiction, is in Berlin Adlershof already reality. The Fraunhofer-Institut FIRST has developed the groundbreaking “Berlin Brain Computer Interface”, a machine, which can read thoughts. The designs, which are forged in Berlin Adlershof, were simply always already high-flown. In 1909, the first German airport for motor-planes opened on the site, and Adlershof became the “Mecca” of the aircraft industry. Today, a good 100 years later, the “Wissenschafts and Wirtschaftsstandort Adlershof”, WISTA for short, is Germany’s most modern high technology park and the most important scientific, economic, and media centre in Berlin. Since 1991, on the four square kilometre large area, eleven extramural research institutions have established themselves, as well as six Humboldt University institutes and more than 800 companies. Through the exchange of knowledge between the various establishments and their worldwide networks, innumerable innovative products and new jobs have already been created. Thereby, a concentration takes place in the technology fields of the photonic and optic, micro-systems and materials, information technology IT and media, biotechnology and environmental as well as photovoltaics.",,,,https://media.radissonhotels.net/image/destination-pages/localattraction/16256-118729-f63244989_3xl.jpg?impolicy=HomeHero,https://www.visitberlin.de/en/wista-adlershof,,,,
