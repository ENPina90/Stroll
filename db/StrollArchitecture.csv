Gendarmenmarkt,Location,Baroque: 1600-1790,,Gendarmenmarkt,52.5137224,13.3926698,,"The Gendarmenmarkt is often described as one of the most beautiful squares in Europe. This reputation is wholly due to three large structures on the square, as the historic structures edging the square (of which only four survive to the present day) were not prominent, with the same true of the very different buildings of recent decades. The square is home to the Schauspielhaus, built by Karl Friedrich Schinkel (no. 44). It appears almost symmetrical, flanked as it is by the Fran-zosischer Dom - to the north - and the Deutscher Dom. It is a rare passer-by who notices that the Franzosische Dom stands slightly nearer the Schauspielhaus (no. 54) than its counterpart to the south.
The square was originally intended to be Friedrichstadtischer Markt, a market place, in the centre at the end of Friedrichstadt, laid out in rectangular form at the end of the 17th century. By decree, one church W'as built for the Huguenot French emigres and one for Germans. The French church, completed in 1705 to plans by Louis Cayart, was based upon the chief church of the Huguenots in Charenton, near Paris, which was destroyed in 1685. Martin Griinberg built the German church in 1708, on a floor plan that continued that of the Parochi-alkirche (no. 14): a pentagon with five semi-circular cupolas.
In 1735 the soldier King Friedrich Wilhelm I had stables added to both churches for his Gens d’armes regiment - the origin of the name Gendarmenmarkt. His son Friedrich 11 had these removed again, instead commissioning Karl von Gontard with the construction of two, completely identical, domed tower constructions, built between 1781-85. These towers had no practical purpose, serving merely as ornamental architecture for the decoration of the square.
The present-day outer appearance of the German church dates back to a reconstruction in 1882, with the interior redesigned along modern lines following reunification, for the display of German historical exhibits. In 1905, the facades of the French church were also altered, by Otto March, in neo-Baroque style.
The Gendarmenmarkt was heavily damaged in the Second World War. The GDR rebuilt the three grand buildings on the square - in partially altered form. Noteworthy here is the exposed stairway on the western side of the French church, a new addition from the early 1980s. In order to divide the interior of the church into two halls, the floor was lowered and a new suspended ceiling added in approximately 13-feet height. As a consequence, the stairway had to be augmented, leading to both the new lower church as w'ell as the upper church hall. The Baroque-sty le design blended effortlessly into the existing ensemble. The square was renamed Platz der Akademie in 1950, a decision reversed in 1991. The peripheral buildings opposite the Schauspielhaus allow a comparison to be made between two architectural levels: in the northeast stand three historic prefabricated buildings from the closing years of the GDR (see no. 347, 370, 374), to the southeast three commercial buildings in the Critical Reconstruction style of the 1990s: by Hil-mer-Sattler (light beige), Max Dudler (dark grey) and Josef Paul Kleihues (brown)."
Andreas Schlüter,Architect,Baroque: 1600-1790,1659 (Danzig) - 1714 (St. Petersberg,Zeughaus,52.5181114,13.3969628,,"“If we remove Schlüter from the history of Berlin, little remains to elevate the city amongst the ranks of great art metropolises on this planet. ” Max Osborn 1909
Andreas Schlüter is the most important architect in Berlin, prior to Knobelsdorff and Schinkel (no. 44). He was the first master builder, raising architecture to the highest of artistic levels in the royal seat. He also elevated the standard of building and craftsmanship in Berlin to a level that was previously unknown, and that was to endure for a considerable time.
The son of a sculptor, Schlüter was educated in Danzig, the place of his birth. The first evidence of his activity can be found in Warsaw, where he worked from 1689-93, on objects including the gable relief of the Krasinski-Palais. It was here that Schlüter learned the functions of a construction site, under the leadership of the court artist Tilman van Gameren. It appears that his work in Poland was not yet that of an architect. In 1694, the Brandenburg Elector Friedrich III, later King Friedrich I, in Prussia, called him to Berlin to work as a sculptor. There was no mention of architecture at this point, with Johann Arnold Nering in charge of the construction matters of the city at that time. On his return from a study trip in 1696, Schlüter was commissioned with the design of keystones on the windows and doors of the Zeughaus (no. 16), which had been designed by Nering. In addition, he also received a commission for a bronze rider statue of the Great Elector, which was to become his greatest work as a sculptor. It was created for a prominent location on the Lange Briicke between Schlossplatz and the present day Nikoiai-viertel (no. 362). Today it stands in the forecourt of Schioss Charlottenburg (no. 19), with a copy in the cupola hall of the Bodemuseum (no. 131).
In 1698, Schlüter succeeded Nering as architect for the construction of the Zeughaus. He also created the famous masks of the dying warriors in the courtyard, together with the trophies on the roof balustrade. In the same year, he was assigned with the task of converting the Elector’s Renaissance castle on the Spree Island into a royal palace. Friedrich I appointed him director of castle construction for this purpose. The castle (no. 7), with the Schlüterhof that was later named after him, is his chief work. It was damaged in the war and demolished in 1950 on the orders of Walter Ulbricht. The Staats-ratsgebaude of 1964 (no. 308), erected on Schlossplatz by the GDR government, incorporated a portal of the castle with sculpted ornamentation in the facade.
Schlüter fell from favour after the Minzturm (no. 17) that he had designed on the northwest corner of the castle collapsed. It was to have been the royal trademark of the royal residence. In 1704, two thirds of the construction were already completed when the tower began to tilt, threatening to collapse. Schlüter attempted to save the tower with the addition of supports and iron rings, covered by a second, more complex design. Despite these efforts, in 1706, he was forced to preempt the threatened collapse by demolishing part of the tower. He was released from the service of the court in 1707. Schlüter never really recovered from this ignominy. The misfortune not
only affected his artistic pride; it also pulled him down into a severe nervous crisis. To the King he remained a bad memory: “Schlüter, the rogue who built the tower so rottenly”.
In 1710, Schliiter left the Akademie der Wissenschaften, the academy of sciences in Berlin. His final building in Berlin was the Landhaus Kameke, built in 1711 -12. It was damaged in the Second World War and later demolished (see no. 21).
Following the death of Friedrich 1, whose ornate tin coffin Schlüter had modeled and prepared for casting, Schlüter left Berlin in 1713, heading for St. Petersburg, where he pitched himself headlong into his work. He died one year after his arrival, before he was able to begin the implementation of his grandiose plans. The exact date of his death (like that of his birth) is unknown; no authentic image of him exists. Only Schlüter’s sculptures remain, telling the tale of the genius of this extraordinary artist to the present day."
The Forum Fridericianum,Location,Baroque: 1600-1790,,Bebelplatz,52.5166162,13.394147,,"The State Concept of Frederick the Great in Bricks and Mortar - The Forum Fridericianum is one of the most significant building ensembles in Berlin. Work began on the prestigious project directly after the coronation of Friedrich II. The king wished to express his concept of the state as a tightly knit unit of monarchy, art and science in the form of a construction project on Unter den Linden. The king himself drew up the plans for an opera house, academy building and royal palace, with the plans further developed by his favoured architect, Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff. Of the original plans, only the opera house actually came to fruit, built by Knobelsdorff in Classicist style between 1741-43 (see no. 27). Today, the group of buildings presents less of a uniform appearance than was originally intended by Friedrich II and Knobelsdorff.
St.-Hedwigs-Kathedrale (no. 33) was built in 1747 for the Catholic community, at an angle to the Forum. Its purpose was for Friedrich II to establish a symbol of religious freedom. One year later, on the site of the planned royal palace to the north of Unter den Linden Johann Boumann began construction of a palace for Prince Heinrich. The plans for this were provided by Friedrich II and Knobelsdorff. In 1810 the building became the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Universitat, the present-day Humboldt University. The rear wing of the university building was added by the counsellor for construction Ludwig Hoffmann (no. 141) between 1913 andl919, with the pattern of the Baroque facade simply further extended.
Where once the academy was to stand, the Konigliche Bibliothek (no. 171) was built, to plans of Friedrich II, with construction beginning in 1755. The King based his idea upon a fifty-year old plan by Fischer von Erlach for the Vienna Hofburg. An unfortunate choice, as the sweeping construction bears no relation to the opera house and does not go with the more severe form of the rectangular Forum.
Following heavy damage in the Second World War, the entire Forum was reconstructed in the GDR era, largely true to original, as least as far as the exterior is concerned. The interior of the Hedwigs-Kathedrale, the Alte Bibliothek and the Humboldt University were redesigned in modern style.
In 1995, in the centre of present-day Bebelplatz, the Israeli artist Micha Ull-man created a memorial in memory of the book burnings of the National Socialists on this spot in 1933. A glass plate offers a view into an underground room, illuminated at night, with empty bookshelves.
Around the monument, an underground car park has been built beneath the square, which was once a green space. The planning of the car park drew heavy criticism from a number of artists."""
From Prussian Residence to Capital of the German Empire ,,Neo-Classicism: 1790-1871,,Museum Island,52.5169328,13.4018997,,"The first indication of a new era in Berlin was a lively intellectual movement. In the famous salons of the city, the leading heads of the burgeoning middle class met to debate the ideas of the Enlightenment, art and literature. In 1791, as the starting signal for a new architectural age, Carl Gotthard Langhans erected his neo-Greek Brandenburger Tor (no. 40) between the Baroque palaces on Pariser Platz. With its references to the ancient world, Classicism stood for the ideal of a free civic society.
The military defeat at the hand of Napoleon, which heralded the collapse of Prussian absolutism, provided a new impetus for this breakthrough. A small group of reformers grouped around Freiherr vom Stein introduced a phase of political and intellectual renewal. One of the more durable reforms was the new Städteordnung, the municipal self-administration, of 1808, which heralded the self-government of the Prussian state.
In 1810, Wilhelm von Humboldt founded the Friedrich-Wilhelm-Universitat (today’s Humboldt University), with lectures held, amongst others, by Fichte,
Hegel, Schleiermacher and Ranke. The school system was improved; after 1850 there were scarcely any children of school age that were not being taught.
The political constitution of Prussia, on the other hand, failed to fulfill the expectations of the citizens. However, one of the contradictory aspects of Berlin is that, in the time of political repression and social problems, science and education, arts and culture experienced one of their most glorious ages.
The outstanding architect of this time was Karl Friedrich Schinkel (no. 44). He not only left his mark on the face of the city with outstanding buildings such as the Neue Wache (no. 52), the Schauspielhaus (no. 54) and the Altes Museum (no. 62), as chief Prussian civil servant in the field of construction he also controlled and improved all other significant construction projects in the city, and throughout Prussia. Schinkel handed Berlin architecture of a European radiance, of a type that it was only to replicate again at the beginning of the 20th century. The works of his numerous pupils, such as Stüler, Strack or Persius (the so-called Schinkel school) led to his influence remaining tangible in the architecture of Berlin up to the establishment of the German Reich in 1871. The numerous churches, municipal buildings and residential houses of the Schinkel school are characterized by cuboid structures, harmonious proportions, restrained ornamentation and careful details. The archetype of Schinkel’s Bauakademie (no. 65) can be seen on the facades of many buildings.
In the layout of the new city districts, a decisive role was played by the garden architect Peter Josef Lenne. The Royal director of gardens was handed responsibility for all urban planning in 1840. The principle result of his work was an overall plan for decorative and peripheral elements, which foresaw, amongst other projects, a semi-circular boulevard for the north and east of the city, as well as a broad axis to the south of the centre, broken up by squares. A large proportion of these plans were subsequently incorporated into the 1862 development plan of James Hobrecht (no. 74). In the so-called “Hobrecht plan”, the pattern of streets was laid out upon which the dense Berlin of tenement houses was to grow over the following 50 years, a pattern that continues to characterize the inner-city areas to this day.
Where liberal ideas were suppressed in the political field, the commercial and industrial policies of Prussia followed the principle of free trade. The highest priority here was the establishment of a competitive industrial base in keeping with the European industrialized nations, the most modern of which was Great Britain.
In the 1830s, an economic dynamism gathered pace that, in just a few decades, was to turn the royal capital city of Prussia into the pre-eminent German industrial metropolis. 1837 saw the opening of the first railway line in Prussia, between Berlin and Potsdam. Berlin expanded beyond the city walls, which had been removed by the second half of the 19th century. Following the war with Napoleon, Berlin numbered a mere 160,000 inhabitants, by the eve of the establishment of the German Reich in 1871 the city already boasted a population of 800,000."
Karl Friedrich Schickel,Architect,Neo-Classicism: 1790-1871,1781 (Neuruppin) - 1841(Berlin),Altes Meuseum,52.5194665,13.3987445,,"Karl Friedrich Schinkel is the most significant German architect of the 19th century. He owes this position to his enormous creative energy, his extensile versatility (not only as architect and civil servant but also as painter, stage designer and furniture designer) and to the remarkable scope of his work. In his larger buildings and his written works, Schinkel returned time and again to the basic questions of architecture, answering these in his own manner. This is a further reason why Schinkel's works have remained vivid and fruitful like those of scarcely any other master builder.
His legacy is so universal that even today he is still quoted by the most varied of architects working in Berlin. The avant-garde point to perhaps the most famous of Schinkel's quotes: “True vitality only exists where new things are created.* More traditional master builders appreciate more the tectonic linkage of his historically-rooted structures and his talent for the picturesque. Born and raised in Neuruppin, Brandenburg. Karl Friedrich Schinkel moved to Berlin with his mother, who was widowed young. In Berlin he studied under Friedrich Gilly, also spending time in his family home. Gilly's individual style, with its hints at the architecture of the French Revolution, had a great influence upon Schinkels own designs.
His debut work was the Pomonatempel with Ionic porticus, erected in 1800 on the Pfingstberg in Potsdam. It has recently been restored. From 1803 to 1805, he travelled through Italy, France and Germany. Due to a lack of large commissions, Schinkel painted panoramas and dioramas, as well as romantic landscape paintings. An intensive interest in theatre sets followed; his most famous design is the starry sky for the appearance of the Queen of the Night in The Magic Flute.
In 1810, Schinkel was recommended by Wilhelm von Humboldt for an administrative position at the Prussian construction office, becoming privy construction counsellor in 1815 and director of the Prussian construction office in 1830. With this appointment, he was responsible for all large construction projects from the Rhineland to East Prussia, often intervening in their implementation.
Schinkel’s main works were built in Berlin between 1816 and 1830: the Neue Wache (no. 52), the Schauspielhaus (no. 54), and the building that Schinkel himself considered his best: the Altes Museum (no. 62). Influenced by Gilly’s drawings of the Marienburg, Shinkel also designed neo-Gothic structures such as the Kreuzberg Denkmal memorial (no. 53) or the Friedrichwerdersche kirche (no, 61).
Although Schinkel never constructed in a truly revolutionary style, in his later works he erected buildings that were oriented strongly towards their intended purpose, moving away from the classical lines of the ancient world, for example in the plans for a store on the Unter den Linden, which was never realized. He also incorporated the state-of-the-art construction techniques of the time into his buildings. Many of the later principles of Modernism can be seen here. However, a complete casting-off of the familiar forms was not the intention of Shinkel. On his voyage to England he noted, on seeing the modern, completely unornamented factory buildings: “It makes a terribly eerie impression, monstrous buildings constructed by workmen alone, without architecture and for the most basic of requirements.*
His talent for painting can be seen primarily in two smaller buildings in Potsdam, Schloss Charlottenhof and the Roman Baths. Numerous imaginative projects from his final years were never realized, but exercised a great influence on his pupils: a royal castle on the Acropolis in Athens and Castle Orianda in the Crimea, with the richly ornamented ancient Greek building forms dominating once more.
Schinkel’s most significant later work was the red brick cube of the Bauakademie (no. 65), a groundbreaking building in which he lived in an apartment with office.

Acropolis of the Arts: Museum Island,Location,Neo-Classicism: 1790-1871,,,52.5200066,13.404954,,"When, In 1824, Karl Friedrich Schinkel (no. 44) began work on his Museum Am Lustgarten (no. 62) no one could have guessed that the following hundred years would witness the growth of a museum complex (unique of its kind in the world) on the island in the Spree to the rear of it. The impetus for this came from Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm (later King Friedrich Wilhelm IV) with his 1835 vision of a ""Refuge of the arts and sciences”. The first to arrive was Stüler's Neues Museum (no. 77). He also designed the raised temple of the Nationalgalerie (no. 89). Von Ihne built the Bodemuseum (no. 131) on the northern tip of the island, and finally, in 1930, the three wings of the Pergamonmuseum (no. 153) were completed, to plans by Messel. Alter being damaged in the war, the buildings were reconstructed in the GDR era - with the exception of the ruins of the Neues Museum. Since 1999, the buildings have been part of the Unesco World Heritage.
Within the scope of the ""Museumsinsel master plan”, five buildings are to be restored and linked at the foundation levels using an ""architectural promenade"". Work is due to be completed by 2025. In addition to the connecting promenade, a subject of much debate were the plans for the new central entrance building, which the British architect David Chipperfield is to erect between the Neues Museum and the Kupfergraben. Due to the heated reaction they evoked, the plans for the 59-feel high glass structure were adjusted and are now reminiscent of the motif of Stüler's colonnades. Upon its completion in 2017, it will be used to accommodate a large portion of the infrastructure, such as cloakrooms, museum shops and cafeteria, as well as an auditorium and areas for alternating exhibitions. It is the first time in over 70 years that the group of buildings on the Museuinsinsel is to be augmented by a new building.
The work on the Alte Nationalgalerie was completed by the architect HG Merz in 2001. The completion of the reconstruction of the Bodemuseum by Heinz Tesar followed in autumn 2005.

James Hobrecht,Architect,Neo-Classicism: 1790-1871,1825 (Memel) - 1902 (Berlin),Hackescher Markt,52.5239791,13.4024357,,"“How much of the earnings from the services required by the better-off trickle down to die poorer Inhabitants of the tenements!’*
fames Hobrecht, 1868
James Hobrecht created what continues to be the core of the German capital to this day: the urban development plan that, during the Kaiser era, turned Berlin into the “largest tenement city in Europe” (see no. 113), together with a sewer system that was to establish itself as the most resilient network in the city. Following a significant period in which the “tenement* model was held to be an example of inhuman construction, Hobrecht’s work is now generally acclaimed. Attempts are now even underway to rebuild the Gründerzeit city.
James Hobrecht (the first name came from English ancestors) was born in 1825 in the eastern part of East Prussia, the second of five children. He broke off his studies in agriculture, working initially as a surveyor, moving to the Prussian capital in 1847, in order to pursue his studies at the Bauakademie (no. 65). One year later, the revolution broke out. As a National Liberal fighting on the side of the rebels, Hobrecht remained a child of the 1848 revolution for the rest of his days: marked by his experience that seemingly immovable circumstances can be brought into motion, and that freedom and self-determination of the people are no longer abstract formulations.
It is against this background that the development plan of 1862 should be seen, conceived by Hobrecht as the government's master builder on behalf of the Berlin Chief of Police. The fact that the population of the city had doubled in scarcely 25 years led to him extending the municipal area by five and half times its size. Legislation was more supportive of the public sphere than that of the property owners, who nonetheless maintained their grip on state power due to the linkage of suffrage with property ownership. Hobrecht developed a street plan interspersed at relatively regular intervals by squares. The streets were 72 feet wide or more, and laid out as decoratively as the garden artist Peter Joseph Lenne (see no. 60) had previously decreed.
A minimum of rules enabled a maximum of urban growth: with the entry into force of the development plan scarcely a decade passed before the population of Berlin had doubled again. Hobrecht favoured tenement buildings due to their “recommendable mixed habitation” of rich and poor - the richer inhabitants in the piano nobile at the front of the complex, poorer citizens in the roof and cellar apartments, as well as to the rear. This cohabitation of the different social classes did not last long, however. In addition, living in such close proximity soon endangered the health of the population: over one thousand inhabitants died each year from typhus alone, one of the principal reasons for this lying in the fact that excrement was collected in cess pits, which became breeding grounds for infection. After Hobrecht had pressed for hygiene to become a primary concern for some years, in the 1860s, as construction counsellor of Stettin he was able to plan and construct the sewage systems of the city, together with the waterworks. With this reference, and the support of the doctor and politician Rudolf Virchow, in 1872 he received the commission to construct a similar system for Berlin. Four years later the sewage system was inaugurated, with completion in 1907. In contrast to systems such as that in use in London, the sewage was not channelled into the rivers from which drinking water was drawn, but employed as fertiliser on fields. With this concept, Hobrecht became a leading and recognised urban engineer for more than 30 German towns and cities. He also developed similar plans for Moscow, Cairo and Tokyo.
In 1885, Hobrecht was appointed construction counsellor for civil and underground engineering. During the 12-year occupancy of this position, he had the Spree regulated within the municipal district of Berlin, thus hindering flooding and water logging of the ground. In addition, 28 bridges were constructed, with at least six of these designed by Hobrecht himself. The effects of his municipal activity are still tangible in the urban landscape today.
On his retirement in 1897, Hobrecht was honoured by the city with the elevation of the privy construction counsellor to the position of alderman of Berlin. He remained an esteemed figure in his Field, associated intrinsically to construction in the capital as a member of the Konigliche Akademie des Bauwesens, the royal construction academy, and Berliner Architektenverein, Berlin’s architectural association, until his death in 1902."
From Capital of the Empire to European Metropolis,Era,Historicism 1871-1918,1871-1918,Kurfürstendamm,52.5044,13.3353524,,"With the founding of the German Reich in 1871, Berlin took the final step to becoming the political, economic and cultural centre of Germany. The metropolis attracted migrants from throughout Germany like no other city. In the last four decades of the 19th century, the number of inhabitants quadrupled from 500,000 to two million. The reparation payments from France, defeated in the Franco-Prussian War, led to a general economic upswing. A characteristic aspect of this era, often referred to as “Wilhelminian”, after the Kaisers Wilhelm I and Wilhelm II, was that Germany, although economically the most advanced nation in Europe, had the most regressive political constitution.
A consequence of this period of upheaval was a fundamental alteration of the visage of the city. Within the space of Just a few decades, the historic city centre and Tiergarten (no. 60) were surrounded by an enormous ring of tenement districts (no. 113), with numerous churches, schools, hospitals, public baths and public parks. In 1873, work began on a new sewer network, to plans by the construction counsellor James Hobrecht (no. 74), supported by the doctor and politician Rudolf Virchow. This sewer system is still in functional use today. At the turn of the century the “world’s largest tenement district” was both one of the healthiest and cleanest major cities in Europe. The architecture of the municipal buildings was influenced heavily around the turn of the century by Ludwig Hoffmann (no. 141), who was construction counsellor in Berlin for a period of almost 30 years.
The middle classes were attracted primarily to the “Neuer Westen”, the centre of which became established in the neo-Romanesque district around the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedachtniskirche (no. 107). The Kurfürstendamm (no. 145) was laid out to a width of 177 feet, and was soon flanked on either side by ostentatious residential buildings. Wilmersdorf and Schoneberg also saw breathtaking growth in new street networks, interspersed with decorative squares (see Viktoria-Luise-Platz no. 120). The centre of the city saw the addition of two poorly-situated Wilhelminian state buildings, the Reichstag building (no. 106) and the Berliner Dom.
The drive for the decorative saw a blooming of the city. Every unused space, every green area was decorated with sculptures from the school of Berliner Realismus. The most famous sculptor of the time was Reinhold Begas, whose works included the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Denkmal memorial at the Schlossfreiheit, demolished after the war along with the Berlin Stadtschloss (no. 7).
The first lines for the over ground and underground urban railways were built. Before the gates of the former city walls, a ring of railway stations, port facilities, city canals, slaughterhouses and giant factories grew. In 1882, the first electric arc lamps were fitted in Leipziger Straße and on Potsdamer Platz, three years later the first large municipal power station entered into operation.
In 1910, the capital held an urban planning competition (no. 157), covering a much larger area than the municipal area, which by 1920 had reached the borders that it occupies today. This was the first attempt to plan the Greater Berlin area.
No other European metropolis had investigated this theme at such an early stage.
At the same time, in Berlin in the early years of the 20th century (similarly to the beginning of the 19th century), a new architectural form of European influence took shape: Alfred Messel designed his large department stores (of which no single example remains today (see no. 126, 137)) and Peter Behrens built the famous turbine hall for AEG (no. 151).
These novelties are often described as a “preliminary stage” for the Modernist era of the 1920s. For the Berlin architectural historian Julius Posener, in contrast, this evaluation is an inadequate one. He notes that, “this era ... has its own colour and its own value”, and, moreover, “that the years up to 1918 were the decisive ones”."
The Berlin Tenement House,Concept,Historicism: 1871-1918,,Ackerstraße 132,52.53642,13.38773,,"In spite of the destruction wrought by war and demolition, the visage of a large portion of inner-city Berlin remains heavily influenced by one type of building: the Berlin apartment block.
The origins of the building lie in the 18th century, where landowners began to develop rear courtyards for residential purposes. Over the course of time, side wings were added on. The later construction of apartment blocks adopted the pattern of erecting a front building with side wings and cross buildings. As the apartment block represented almost the sole form of housing in the 19th century, the result was the mixture of varied social classes in front and rear house that was so typical for the city.
The overwhelming majority of Berlin apartment blocks were constructed during the period of breakneck growth experienced by the city in the last two decades of the 19th century. Their form was greatly influenced by the Hobrecht Plan (1862, see no. 74), which specified the street plans and the minimum size of the courtyards. By 1887, these were only required to be 17.40 x 17.40 feet in size. This was sufficient for the wagons of the fire brigade to be able to turn around. As a consequence, Berlin had the highest population density of all European metropolises. Living conditions in the overcrowded, often squalid apartment blocks were soon subjected to heavy criticism from contemporary sources. The urban hostility of the Modernist movement has many of its roots here. It was not until 1925 that side and cross wings were outlawed in the new building ordinance.
In layout and comfort, apartments varied from district to district. Where working class districts had more courtyards behind one another and extremely small apartments, in Charlottenburg or Wilmersdorf, large middle class houses were erected with green courtyards and apartments with more than a dozen rooms (see no. 145). The height of the floors also varied. The older apartment blocks exhibit strictly patterned facades, whereas road fronts were later vitalised with balconies and bay windows. Depending on taste, they were decorated in Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque or a mixture of styles.
Following the Second World War, one of the primary objectives of the urban planners was to replace the much-criticised apartment blocks with modern, new' apartments. In the course of the Kahlschlagsanierung, the process of razing entire areas, in the 1960s and 1970s entire districts were torn down. This ignored the fact that many inhabitants actually liked living in their old apartments and only wished for modernised kitchens, bathrooms and heating (see IBA no. 355). Older apartments renovated in this fashion remain among the most popular forms of housing amongst all sectors of the population to this day. The century-old floor plans have proved their extreme flexibility over the course of the years.
The vastly predominant form of living in the 19th century: the tenement house.
One of the saddest chapters in the construction history of Berlin is the “de-stucco-ing” of the tenement houses. In the 1960s and 1970s, in both East and West, around three quarters of all old housing stock buildings had their facade stucco hacked off - with the perpetrators both housing associations and private owners. Reasons included a belief that a “simplified” facade would be cheaper to maintain, as well as ideological reasons: the stucco was a relict of an abominable era. The architect of the Philharmonie (no. 307), Hans Scharoun (no. 281), formulated it thus: “The stucco on the walls is the stucco in our heads.” No other city treated its historic substance with such a degree of harshness. rh"

Ludwig Hoffmann
Ludwig Hoffmann built more structures In Berlin than Schlüter (no. 18), Knobelsdorff and Schinkel (no. 44) put together. He was the great organiser of the Wilhelminian construction projects and the most significant architect of municipal Berlin.
In the era of great economic expansion in the city, schools, hospitals, bath houses, fire stations and administrative buildings were all erected under his leadership, as “Islands of taste in a sea of grey stone”, as a contemporary critic put it. The majority of his buildings withstood the destruction of war and demolition almost untouched. They continue to exert their influence on the historic districts of Berlin to this day.
Hoffmann was born in Darmstadt on 30th june 1852, the son of a lawyer. He grew up in a middle class household.
After passing his Abitur school examination in his hometown, he left to study architecture in Berlin in 1874, together with his childhood friend Alfred Messel. He went on to become a favourite pupil of Johann Heinrich Strack, a former colleague of Schinkel.
Hoffmann’s breakthrough came with his design for the Reichsgericht courthouse in Leipzig. His work was awarded first prize of 119 submitted works. The building of the 35-year-old also met with widespread acclaim on its completion, making him one of the most sought-after architects in the country. Despite this, he rejected the offer of the position of privy counsellor, the highest construction official in the land. Instead, he was elected construction counsellor of Berlin in 1896, attracted by the manifold construction projects of the capital.
Hoffmann soon detached himself from the convention that specific building types required a specific style: churches were Gothic, museums Roman, courts of law in the style of the Renaissance. Hoffmann constructed his numerous schools in various styles; German Renaissance, Baroque style or the almost style-free brick structures of Schinkel.
Details that seem overloaded today were extremely modern at their time. The contemporary observer becomes aware of this at the latest on comparing Hoffmann’s buildings with the more extreme creations of Historicism. The architectural historian Julius Posener described Hoffmann’s buildings as ""likeable"": ""They were influenced by Wilhelminian optimism, and they wanted to generate confidence."" This friendly impression was achieved through two routes. One of these was surprising, picturesque deviations from strict formality. Hoffmann was also more sparing in his use of historic style elements than his contemporaries, there is nothing petty about his buildings, contours and facades are clearly readable: large roof surfaces with gently sculpted gables are common, or walls with large surface areas. A clear reference to more simple country house architecture is often noticeable. Perhaps the most typical example of Hoffmann’s “likeability"" is the Marchenbrunnen fountain in the Volkspark Friedrichshain (no. 91).
Hoffmann’s most significant buildings include the Stadthaus (no. 159), incorporating motifs from the Gontard towers on Gendarmenmarkt (see no. 13), the Markisches Museum (no. 146) with its collage of Brandenburg architectural references and the castle-like, neo-Baroque Rudolf-Virchow-Krankenhaus hospital. His oeuvre is almost limitless, encompassing over 60 schools and sports halls, 13 hospitals, eight bridges and five hath houses.
Hoffmann was construction counsellor for almost three decades. When he left office in 1924, the revolutionary house of the printer Max Taut had just been completed. However, this breach, caused by the onset of the Modern and its social utopia failed to attract Hoffmann as a follower. His intention had not been to change the political situation, but to satisfy it. He died in Berlin on 11 th November 1932."
"Weimar Republic, the Metropolis of Berlin in the 1920s",Era,Early Modernism: 1918-1933,1918-1933,Hufeisensiedlung,52.4482189,13.4498942,,"The 1920s were characterised by democratic emancipation, unparalleled levels of inflation, technical progress and an upheaval in the fields of art and architecture. However, these were anything but secure times. Until 1923, Germany experienced a level of inflation that had never been witnessed before. The situation only calmed down following the currency reform in 1924. However, the Weimar Republic was once again plunged into crisis towards the end of the 1920s due to the world economic depression.
The economic and political instability had an almost inspirational effect upon the fields of art and architecture. Berlin was the central point between Paris and Moscow. While impulses from the fields of fashion and theatre came from France, the focal point in the young Soviet Union was focused on the fields of painting and architecture. The constructivists joined forces in Moscow. Their utopian designs, in which buildings seem to lose their earthly connection, had their counterpart in Germany. Between 1919 and 1921, the architect Bruno Taut published the Frühlicht (early light) magazine, in which he propagated the new form of architecture. He drew up designs for buildings under the title of “Alpine Architektur”, which were copies of crystals as it were. The Bauhaus style of architecture was founded in Weimar, which would develop a new type of architecture for a new society from there. However, hardly any building work was carried out due to the economic situation. Only the young architect Erich Mendelsohn managed to build the so-called Einsteinturm, an architectural envelopment of a solar telescope, in Potsdam.
It was only from the middle of the 1920s that the long yearned for construction boom in the Weimar Republic began. The new commissions included the following: residential estates (see no. 194), high-rise buildings, sports complexes, film palaces, filling stations, airports - technical progress demands new types of buildings. The 1920s began in a very utopian manner, yet the first buildings were very conventional. Only ideology remained. “Our age is not full of pathos; we do not value the great leap forward but rather reason and functionalism” is how the architect Mies van der
Rohe expressed this idea. The greatest challenge constituted the construction of housing for the completely overpopulated cities. Berlin became a centre of council housing buildings.
In architectural terms, Berlin experienced a boom in architecture, which would only be repeated again 70 years later. The engine behind the urban development was the state, which created the basis for the expansion of the city through large infrastructure projects (the extension of the underground and S-Bahn railways, the Tempelhof Airport (no. 249), power and water supply buildings. Berlin was on the brink of being promoted into the Premier League of world architecture. A competition was announced for a high-rise office building at the Bahnhof Friedrichstraße, at the same time as a competition for the new construction of a high-rise building of the “Chicago Tribune"" in which 263 architects throughout the world took part. While a Gothicised draft, typical of the time was selected and realised in Chicago, the realisation of the project in Berlin became the victim of inflation. The most significant projects of this age were realised by architects in the form of detached houses and mansions for major industrialists. They did not embark on the social task of building economical housing for the masses until the second half of the 1920s.
The 1920s also revealed themselves to be extremely heterogeneous in terms of historical architectural styles. While the early projects were still characterised by expressionist styles, the “new objectivity” is beginning to assert itself, which for its part was replaced by a certain degree of recourse to more traditional construction forms towards the end of the 1920s. Within a period of ten years, the architecture in Berlin had developed a degree of diversity, on which it still thrives today.        
A consequence of this period of upheaval was a fundamental alteration of the visage of the city. Within the space of Just a few decades, the historic city centre and Tiergarten (no. 60) were surrounded by an enormous ring of tenement districts (no. 113), with numerous churches, schools, hospitals, public baths and public parks. In 1873, work began on a new sewer network, to plans by the construction counsellor James Hobrecht (no. 74), supported by the doctor and politician Rudolf Virchow. This sewer system is still in functional use today. At the turn of the century the “world’s largest tenement district” was both one of the healthiest and cleanest major cities in Europe. The architecture of the municipal buildings was influenced heavily around the turn of the century by Ludwig Hoffmann (no. 141), who was construction counsellor in Berlin for a period of almost 30 years.
The middle classes were attracted primarily to the “Neuer Westen”, the centre of which became established in the neo-Romanesque district around the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedachtniskirche (no. 107). The Kurfürstendamm (no. 145) was laid out to a width of 177 feet, and was soon flanked on either side by ostentatious residential buildings. Wilmersdorf and Schoneberg also saw breathtaking growth in new street networks, interspersed with decorative squares (see Viktoria-Luise-Platz no. 120). The centre of the city saw the addition of two poorly-situated Wilhelminian state buildings, the Reichstag building (no. 106) and the Berliner Dom.
The drive for the decorative saw a blooming of the city. Every unused space, every green area was decorated with sculptures from the school of Berliner Realismus. The most famous sculptor of the time was Reinhold Begas, whose works included the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Denkmal memorial at the Schlossfreiheit, demolished after the war along with the Berlin Stadtschloss (no. 7).
The first lines for the over ground and underground urban railways were built. Before the gates of the former city walls, a ring of railway stations, port facilities, city canals, slaughterhouses and giant factories grew. In 1882, the first electric arc lamps were fitted in Leipziger Straße and on Potsdamer Platz, three years later the first large municipal power station entered into operation.

Martin Wagner,Architect,Early Modernism: 1918-1933,"1885 in Königsberg, 1957 Cambridge/Mass",Hufeisensiedlung,52.4482189,13.4498942,,"“The playgrounds must not be more than 10 minutes away from the living quarters, the parks not more than 20 minutes away, the sports grounds must not be more than 30 minutes away.""
-Martin Wagner, 1915
The name of Martin Wagner is generally associated with two things. On the one hand, he is associated with the dissertation “The sanitary green of the cities. A contribution to the open spaces theory"", which he submitted in 1915. On the other hand, he is known for the residential estates that were constructed in Berlin it the second half of the 1920s. The theoretical work, which had already made him famous and caused much sensation by the age of just 30, can nevertheless be taken as the basis of his practical work at the Zweckverband Groß-Berlin, the council of Berlin and its surrounding communities, and then as Stadtbaurat, which is the head of the office for municipal planning and building control, first in Schöneberg, then in Greater-Berlin. In this function, Wagner, in contrast to all his predecessors, attempted to view urban development as an integrated discipline and to Incorporate green spaces and parks as obvious elements. This may be viewed as a reaction to Berlin's urban structures, which were solely oriented towards exploiting plots of lands and frequently led to catastrophically unhygienic living conditions. Wagner’s bold initiative consequently met with a more positive response from the politicians than from the private property developers, he did, after all, state in his academic work that the neighbouring proprietors - both private and state - would have to bear the costs of the green spaces.
His five guiding principles became a kind of manifesto for planners of green spaces. The demands expressed within it have characterised the design of open spaces to this day. Above all, Wagner’s reflections that there should be an “average of 260 square feet of children’s playground, 17 square feet of sports fields, 5 square feet of promenades, 22 square feet of parkland and 140 square feet of city forest” for each inhabitant, were deemed as being the dictum for urban green space planning offices in the form of so-called reference values until just a few years ago.
However, Martin Wagner has predominantly left behind visible traces of his work as an architect in the city. In his just seven years as the head of the municipal planning and building control office (his predecessor had actually managed to serve 4 times as long), he was responsible for significant building projects such as the Hufeisensiedlung housing estate (no. 193) and the lido Strandbad Wannsee (no. 212.). In addition, Wagner designed the Kriegerheimstatten estate in Friedrichsfeld, which was the first attempt at large-panel building in Germany.
There is no doubt that Martin Wagner was one of the most significant construction politicians of the 20th century. The Berlin-based architecture historian Karl-Heinz Hüter wrote: “In Wagner, a personality committed to social issues assumed the office of the head of the municipal planning and building control office. It comes as no surprise that he was only able to assert himself in certain sub-areas but failed in many others when one considers the opposing political and economic interests and the organised opposition of reactionary circles. His greatest achievement was to have decisively applied metropolitan standards to all the construction projects in Berlin and to have brought the “pioneer of a form of German building"" (Wagner) to the capital city. Without Wagner’s leadership, Berlin would not have been able to become the most significant centre of the new form of building.
After leaving the German civil service in 1933, (he had previously resigned from the Academy of Arts where he had attempted to oppose their political Gleichschaltung, the method of eliminating all opposition, Wagner emigrated to the United States where he lectured at Harvard University as a professor from 1938 until 1950. Wagner died in Cambridge/ Mass, at the age of 71."
Housing Development: Hopes for a New Social Beginning,Concept,Early Modernism: 1918-1933,,Hufeisensiedlung,52.4482189,13.4498942,,"After the First World War, there was an enormous housing shortage in Berlin. Therefore, despite inflation and the economic crisis, the first Greater-Berlin council, which had been formed in 1920, declared the creation of affordable housing to be an important objective of their policy. Following the motto of “light, air and sun”, new style housing estates developed not only in Berlin. In reaction to the construction in the Gründerzeit, which had been almost exclusively privately financed and had made as much as possible from the land plots, new residential estates emerged, in which colourful houses were scattered loosely in park-like complexes.
The housing development of the Modern age, to which representatives such as Bruno Taut and Martin Wagner (no. 185) belong, falls at the same time as the establishment of property developers, who were characterised by the trade unions, cooperatives or non-profit making organisations. As the owners and operators of the housing development, as well as the physical builders of the buildings, they also took care of the collective approach in the operation of the predominantly worker-inhabited quarters. Large industrial operations, such as the AEG or Siemens, also built new residential areas in the immediate neighbourhood to the companies. Among the most well-known is Siemensstadt (no. 215) in today's district of Spandau. On the whole, all settlements were situated outside of the Berlin S-Bahn ring, as it was only here where large enough land plots were situated at reasonable prices.
Typologically, the architects broke with everything that had existed up until then. They said goodbye to the block-by-block development of the quarters and built their residential buildings in the form of ribbons or point blocks in the open landscape. With this anti-urban city model, they actually offered a counter concept to the traditional city of the 19th century. In the years between 1924 and 1930 alone, over 140,000 new apartments emerged in Berlin. This enormous building activity was accompanied by a debate on architecture, where the protagonists of a new Modern era fought with the traditionalists about steep and flat roofs. As National Socialism heralded the end of the Weimar Republic, even the modern housing developments were called into disrepute. From now on, new residential blocks lost their colour and were given steep roofs. However, ribbon development and open spaces with high proportions of green continued to be “en vogue"""
Departure from Historical Continuity,Concept,Early Modernism: 1918-1933,,Huttenstraße 12,52.528196,13.32383,,"Hardly any other period in the history of architecture and art is more difficult to define than the “modern age"". This begins with the very concept which suggests constant renewal but has now itself become historical. “Modernism” indicated much more of a distinct period which started around the year 1900. Charles Jencks, the British architecture historian and spiritual father of post modernism described the year 1972 as the end of modernism. At that time residential buildings were being demolished in the US city of St. Louis, which (although only 20 years old) had been constantly criticised by its inhabitants since the time they moved in. What had happened that an entire period could be declared over due to the demolition of one single building complex?
In architectural history terms modernism can initially be valued as the reaction towards the historicism that was principally abounded at the end of the 19th century and its blunt copying of old building styles. The fathers of the movement, without being aware of the fact, were primarily Peter Behrens, Walter Gropius and Alfred Messel. While Behrens and Messel still attempted to develop new building types from old ones, Gropius shut his eyes to all forms of tradition and, as the founder of the Bauhaus style in Weimar, even had the library history books burned. The dispute was also carried out in Berlin from an ideological and architectural point of view. Messel built the Wertheim department store on Leipziger Platz (no. 137) and attempted to provide a new type of building with a form through his monumental facade, which was based on an already existing formal canon. Behrens attempted the same thing with his turbine hail building in Moabit (see no. 151). Set against this, Gropius and his supporters tried their hands at constructions which radically rejected decoration and ornaments. Their projects were to go dowm in history as “white modernism”. On the other hand, the expressionists applied more colourful and imaginative techniques. Their designs, which remained unrealised for a long time, now bear witness to the attempt to provide architecture with a new impulse through crystalline building forms and bright colours. The forerunners were primarily Bruno Taut and Hans Scharoun (no. 281).
After 1945 the “Modernism"" concept was resurrected following the period during the Third Reich when its trends had been predominantly surpassed. To this day, people are still considering which aspects of this movement can be salvaged for the future under the keyword of “second modernism"". However, in many places, modernism has fallen victim to exactly the thing it had originally attempted to combat: historical continuity,"
Power over the Masses. Construction in the National Socialism Era,Concept,National Socialism: 1933-1945,,Großer Stern,52.514692,13.349137,,"Does National Socialist architecture create a corresponding state of mind? Both German political systems in the post-war period were convinced of this, so all the architectural relics of National Socialism were removed. Even buildings with a politically neutral purpose fell victim to the wrecking ball, such as the Haus des Deutschen Fremdenverkehrs, the German tourism building, which once stood in the place of the Neue Nationalgalerie (no. 320). Where the post-war shortages compelled continued use, even pragmatism was faced with confrontation: for example, at the start of the 1960s, Klaus Tausendschön tried to retouch the effect of the Reichsluftfahrtministerium, the Reich Aviation Ministry (no. 229), which was used as the headquarters of the GDR planned economy, by putting a canteen as a glass box against the property in the yard. At the start of the 1990s, the prejudices were still maintained and the accusation of “fascist construction"" in the Berlin architecture dispute (see no. 375) was used as a killer argument against tradition-oriented building. Of course, there were also counter arguments which put National Socialist buildings in a global architectural history context. They set about revealing continuities or referring to the pluralism of forms of those years in which government buildings were constructed according to an antique archetype, with industrial buildings, for example, in the Bauhaus style and apartments and barracks in a conservative homeland security style. Were, then, the Nazi forms innocent in the final analysis?
Like many others, Adolf Hitler considered architecture as an “ideology set in stone”. His regime saw itself, to all intents and purposes, as modern, which explains the so-called “white industrial boxes”. But, the general opinion is that the modern age was hardly able to transport the ideological message of National Socialism. Like most rulers, Hitler therefore resorted to Classicism for representational purposes. However, National Socialism was far removed from its humanistic impetus. Instead of the individual, it knew only the species ""mankind”, as presented in the films of Leni Riefenstahl. Unlike modern mass society, where it is the crowd which acts, the National Socialist “national body” was subordinate to the ""Führer”. The mass was more solely an ornament and the architecture a means of gaining power over them. From Classicism, they wanted to assume the “power of influencing people” (Albert Speer). The result was disparately oversimplified forms and dimensions increased to the gigantic. Hitler’s Reichskanzlei, the Reich’s Chancellery (no. 248) was the best example of this. The Long Hall, with its 480-feet length, had only one purpose: to keep the people small. Architecture was, most of all, a means of mass suggestion. Like the Lustgarten, many city areas were turned to stone to provide roll-call areas. The death of the young heroes was also effectively staged with the Langemarckhalle, which was the Hall of Remembrance (see no. 236). At the same time, almost as a sign of the preparations for war, barracks, comradeship, invalid residential areas and other paramilitary buildings were also built (see nos. 251, 254, 255).
The National Socialist quest for a public demonstration of power and selfportrayal culminated in the “new design plans” for the world capital “Germania” projected by Albert Speer “on the ideas of the Führer”, which Speer was commissioned with in 1937. A gigantic, almost 1,000-feet wide and 4.4-miles long Via Triumphalis flanked by monumental buildings was to be built as a north-south axis through Berlin. It was to have its exit in the south through a gigantic arch of triumph and lead to a huge 950-feet high dome hall with space for 180,000 people - the ""biggest building in the world”. The reconstruction was to be finished in 1950 and Berlin renamed “Germania”: a gigantomaniacally oversimplified city which symbolised the ""imperial perspective of the world domination being strived for” (Wolfgang Schache). However, the outbreak of war ended the demolition work which had already begun. Despite the total defeat of the National Socialist regime, the principle of city destruction continued in post-war Germany - even if it was under different signs."
Albert Speer,Architect,National Socialism: 1933-1945,1905 (Mannheim) - 1981 (London),Großer Stern,52.514692,13.349137,,"“The apocalypse offered a grandiose spectacle. ’
Albert Speer, 1972
As the Reich Minister for Armaments and Munitions, who organised the “total war”, and participated in the forced labourers programme here, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison at Nuremberg. Albert Speer became famous, however, as “Adolf Hitler’s architect"" - and as one of the most dazzling personalities of the Third Reich. He actually built comparatively little in this time and even less of this has been preserved in Berlin itself, apart from his rather unspectacular residential house in Kronprinzessinnenstraße, there are only fragments such as the candelabra on Straße des 17. Juni and the redesigned Große Stern, the Great Star with the slightly higher Victory Column.
Albert Speer was born into an upper middle class family of architects in Mannheim. After his architectural studies in Karlsruhe, he became assistant to Heinrich Tessenow, a moderate representative of modernism whose architecture fallowed the criteria of simplicity, expedience and practicality, in 1928 in Berlin. In hint, Speer found his ""first catalyst"".
He met his “second catalyst"", Adolf Hitler, in December 1930 at his speech to students in Hasenheide in Berlin. One month later, Speer Joined the Nazi party; the following year he took part in the election campaign. The party rewarded him for this with building commissions: before the assumption of power, he was allowed to rebuild two Berlin offices, later the bureaus of the Propaganda Minister and the Reich Chancellor. As “designer"" of the May celebrations, the radio exhibition in Berlin and the Nuremberg Rally, he became known to Hitler again in 1933.
A close relationship developed: for Hitler, Speer was the architect he had always wanted to be. It was only in discussions with him that the dictator, who was otherwise rather inhibited with his feelings, was relaxed, even laid back; he even tolerated being contradicted. Conversely, Speer endeavoured to accommodate the taste of the “Führer”. At the Nuremberg Rally site, he managed a synthesis between the Classicism favoured by Hitler and the practicality of Tessenow: a facility of gigantic dimensions smothering the individual; the grand stand alone was to hold 60,000 people. Speer was clearly fashionable: at the Paris World Fair in 1937, he was awarded the Grand Prix.
To give his position as almighty “Führer” the appropriate backdrop, Hitler commissioned Speer with the construction of the Neue Reichskanzlei on Voßstraße (no. 248), which was deliberately conceived to intimidate foreign guests of state. The excessively long approach, which diplomats and guests of state had to make to the reception hall, did not fail in its effect. One of the first to realise this was the Czechoslovakian state president Emil Flacha, who, worn down by a nocturnal terror meeting and a heart attack, signed the consent for the occupation of his country by the Germans here in March 1939.
Speer’s sphere of influence had expanded by 1937: Hitler appointed him “General Building Inspector for the Redesign of the Reich Capital”. His responsibility was to rebuild Berlin into a 10 million metropolis “Germania"" by 1950 (see no. 224).
In 1942, Speer was appointed Minister of Armaments. He energetically cranked up the war economy, which was essentially based on the employment of forced labourers and prisoners from concentration camps, and worked together with Heinrich Himmler and the SS to this end. Here, he clearly gave hardly any thought to the more far reaching consequences of his actions.
Unlike the other main players, Speer, at the Nuremberg trials, did not insist he was merely obeying orders. Instead, he assumed responsibility for the commands he had carried out. What he denied, even after his release in 1966 and until the end, was any knowledge of the mass shootings and extermination camps."
Continuing Chaos - the Post-War Period,Era,Reconstruction: 1945-1961,1945-1961,Breitscheidplatz,52.5047297,13.3352316,,"Today, there is still a conflicting relationship to the Berlin architecture in the postwar years. The so-called reconstruction has been rightly called a ""second destruction” of the city. Yet a considerable number of these buildings have since been raised to the status of architectural monuments. From an architectural point of view, they often have little in common with each other as shown with the comparison of the “Hansa Quarter” (see no. 296) cityscape, kept in the modern style, with the monumental “Stalinallee"" mainline (nos. 274, 289, 297), which speaks a traditionalist language which National Socialism also used before. Its function also does not necessarily permit inference to the developers: the Hansa Quarter as a prestigious object of West Berlin is a social residential area, Stalinallee as the “first address” of the apparently “anti-imperialistic” “workers’ and farmers’ state” an imperial splendor mile.
In fact, the chaos that prevailed after 1945 is reflected in all these refractions. The former Reich capital was “the largest contiguous area of ruins in Europe”. Around 40 percent of the living space was destroyed, two thirds of the city centre in ruins - in particular to the south of the Memorial Church (no. 302), between Potsdamer Platz and Ostbahnhof.
The first reconstruction plans were also subject to psychological paralysis. The consequence from the catastrophe of the Second World War, it was said, could only be dealt with by means of a radical break with the past. Large parts of the old city in which society’s memory had become a fixed pillar were to fall victim to this thinking.
With regard to the formation of the future, there was a lack of conception, though, which is shown not least by the most radical design of these years: the “Collective Plan”, which Hans Scharoun (no. 281) introduced as the first Berlin senior government building officer after the war, did not succeed in creating a new aimed-for identity in terms of urban development. Air raids and disassembly had reduced the economic capacity of the once largest industrial metropolis of the continent by 85 percent. Of the 4.3 million Berliners (1939), hardly more than 2.3 million remained.
Only the Marshall Plan introduced in 1947, the goal of which was an economic and subsequent political consolidation of Western Europe, brought about change. The American aid program totaling billions did not just revitalize the economy: with material prosperity, it was possible to remove the NS ideology as well and, at the same time, it was to serve a policy of “containment” of communist influence. In the cultural sector, too, there were efforts to contain nationalism: the influence was again the Modernism (see no. 210) of the Weimar Republic which now returned to Germany as International Style from America. The West's desire to be new again was typified in the virginal white of the residential communities.
For the Soviet occupying power, however, the communist society was the logical consequence of history. Since the sympathizers of this utopia had the power but no democratic or material basis, (the latter even being undermined by the USSR by its dismantling and clearing activities) they developed suggestive dialectics: “National in form, socialistic in content” which should enable the revolution to succeed. This meant that as part of the “national construction work” (no. 296), workers’ palaces, educational temples and countless monuments were built to promote the way of the East towards a different Germany.
At least, the competition between both systems had a positive effect for Berlin: building was done with twice the energy. But at the same time the conflict of interests of the superpowers prevented a mutual policy. And what is more: in 1948, as a consequence of the Berlin blockade, there was a division of the city government. Berlin developed into an international crisis hotspot. Finally, when the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, this indicated that it was not only in town planning that the ideological differences had become insurmountable."
Hans Scharoun,Architect,Reconstruction: 1945-1961,1893 (Bremerhaven) - 1972 (Berlin),Herbert-von-Karajan-Straße 1,52.5100776,13.369992,,"“...make a world out of the smallest part. ” Hans Scharoun, 1954
In his outlook for the year 2008, the editor-in-chief of the architecture magazine Baumeister, recently saw a few older people standing near the Philharmonic Hall. They are holding tattered slides up to the wind with the demand that the culture forum be completed in accordance to Hans Scharoun’s plans! For this fiction it needed little fantasy: there really is a Scharoun society. That it also acts as a caller in the desert fits in with an architect who created countless exceptional buildings - but no complete artwork which would have been continued. Hans Scharoun always stood as solid as a rock.
He was born in 1893 in Bremerhaven as the child of a trader who was always suspicious of the artistic tendencies of his son. He found the first encouragement of his talent from the neighbouring family of the architect Georg Hoffmeyer, whose daughter Scharoun would later marry. He completed his first plans at school: the seventeen-year-old boy gave the Bremen senior government building officer “fundamental considerations for the connection of land and sea"".
He was not able to complete his architecture studies, which he started in 1912 at the Charlottenburg Technical College, because he was conscripted at the start of World War One. During the war, Scharoun was appointed assistant head of the building consultation office in lnsterburg/East Prussia and dealt with the reconstruction of destroyed East Prussian towns. A member of the expressionists “Gläserne Kette“, a group of artists founded by Bruno Taut from the end of the war, from 1925-1932 he was a professor at the State Academy of Art and Applied Arts in Breslau but remained focussed on Berlin, where he opened his office in 1926 and joined the architects' association “Der Ring“, which also included Walter Gropius and Hugo Haring. With the latter, the mentor of organic building, he remained associated all his life.
For the German Werkbund he made several contributions, including in 1927 for the building exhibition at Stuttgart Weissenhof.
In Berlin, he designed part of the Siemensstadt large residential area: individual lines stretch into the sea of trees in Jungfernheide. A typical characteristic of Scharoun’s architecture is the use of maritim: motifs such as rails and portholes, like with the bachelors’ house at Kaiserdamm (no. 203). Ship quotes and city hostility are completely typical of the period here. The unique thing is reflected in the varied ground plans. They are therefore more individual than the architecture of these years, which was primarily aligned towards collective needs. In this period Scharoun found his very own theme - understanding the individual as the centre of architecture: in 1932 fourteen villas were constructed full of refractions and material variations. Only the inhabitants function as a fixed point of the buildings (see Haus Baensch no. 227).
It is obvious that Scharoun’s subject-( red architecture would have to come into conflict with the concept of art of the National Socialists. This is why he limited his activities to the construction of private detached houses during the Third Reich. The festival halls, railway stations and communal palaces which Scharoun designed for himself during the Second World War, however, make it evident that his architecture must also be seen as an attempt at a new social model. But above all, they radiate an optimism which is astonishing when we consider what was happening at the time.
So Scharoun became the man for Zero Hour. As the first post-war senior government building officer of Berlin, he presented in 1946 the (later mistakenly titled) “Collective Plan"". The plan he elaborated with a group of young architects provided for the creation of a new town structure coming from the position of Berlin in the glacial valley between Barnim and Teltow. Only the historic Unter den Linden street of houses and individual historic buildings were to remain. The entire rest of the structural legacy was there to be used. The fundamental idea is the design of a “city band” which, running parallel to the Spree, would combine all political, economic and cultural functions. The motorways which were to pass through the cityscape were going to be created in terms of North American chessboard road patterns. It was the most radical break with all town planning tradition. Scharoun visualised individual freedom and a new beginning - and therefore fulfilled the wishes of many people, especially in the West. But ultimately his plan was so subversive that it could not be implemented.
Hans Scharoun is seen as an intellectual authority for this reason alone. Already in 1946, he was no more than the town planning professor at the Berlin Technical University. He remained president of the Academy of Arts until 1968. During this period, he built a great deal, but always in solitary projects. The highlight of his achievements is the Philharmonic Hall at the Kulturforum (no. 307). This provides the best evidence of the rich collective experiences which his anthropocentric architecture enabled."
Competing Systems,Concept,Reconstruction: 1945-1961,,Hansaviertel,52.5213115,13.3433225,,"The political division of Germany soon became a determining factor in Berlin architecture. In the western part of the city, they were forced at first to build those institutions which were traditionally located in the city centre and were now under Soviet control (university, people’s theatre, business centre etc.). In East Berlin, the new social system also had to be given an architectural foundation.
In East Berlin, Stalinallee was meant to show socialism from its most attractive side (see no. 263). On the road, there were not only countless schools, sports locations and parks generously built, but its 5,000 apartments were also opulent in terms of size and furnishings and equipment (district heating, waste disposal units). Stalinailee was created into a classic Via Triumphalis with grass verges and squares and a palace-like development. With a breakthrough at Alexanderplatz, not only the workers’ district of Friedrichshain was linked directly to the centre, but there was also a "" presentative connection going all the way between Unter den Linden and Stalinallee.
West Berlin reacted to the national construction work in the eastern part of the city with a competition (1953) to elevate the resettlement of the Hansa
Quarter, which had been destroyed in the war, to the core of an international building exhibition. Here it was discovered that the International Style was harmonizing best with the modern understanding of democracy. In fact, the ground plans for apartments were highly individual. The bungalow carpet, the rows of buildings and the high-rises which diverged radically from the old city formed a cityscape which created an all the more deep connection with the Tiergarten zoological garden area.
In 1957 the idea competition “Hauptstadt Berlin” was announced by the Federal government and the Berlin Senate. Since the competition area also covered the eastern sector, East Berlin countered in the following year with the “idea competition for the socialistic redevelopment of the centre of the GDR’s capital”. While its intentions were implemented after the construction of the Berlin Wall, its western counterpart remained largely without consequence.
From now on the visions of the town planners in the East and West were restricted to their own part of the city."
Capital City and Waiting Status -The Divided City 1961-1979,Concept,International Style: 1961-1979,,Alexanderplatz,52.5219814,13.413306,,"Hardly any Berlin constructions of the post-war period were as ugly and, at the same time, as famous as the Berlin Wall (no. 301), and none had such a drastic influence on the development of the city. Even today, long after it has disappeared, its repercussions can still be perceived: the Berlin Wall divided more than just a city; it also separated two different societies.
When it was built on 13th August 1961, the western part of Berlin, which had received around 200,000 citizens from East Berlin since the division of administrations, experienced a shock. Once the separation of the surrounding area became physically manifest, impulses from the outside were lacking. West Berlin lost almost a fifth of its inhabitants until the start of the 1980s. It was primarily the top performers who decided to flee. Industrial groups like AEG and Siemens relocated their head offices to the Federal Republic of Germany on the western side of the Wall. The metropolis with the Wall served more as an extended workbench. The property market collapsed. The elites said goodbye. ""It is a not a culturally pessimistic exaggeration to describe the situation “as apocalyptic,” wrote the architecture historian Vittorio Magnago Lampugnani in 1980. What remained was the retreat into the private world: in the front line city an allotment holder mentality established, and it is characteristic that the garden party of the building senator Harry Ristock from now on formed one of the main social events.
The view that was becoming increasingly widespread that the Iron Curtain was not just a temporary phenomenon was also fatal for the city's development. This did not only lead to the claim of the Federal Republic of Germany to Berlin as a ""capital in waiting* being formulated more infrequently and halfheartedly. Even the inner-city areas of West Berlin near the Berlin Wall were now treated as borderland in town planning terms, which actually amounted to recognition of the division. Politics were restricted mainly to sweetening the lives of the citizens in Berlin with perks: wage earners, for example, were given an eight percent Berlin bonus. Social housing was subsidized with billions. With a decreasing population, it produced around 20,000 new accommodation units each year. Satellite towns like the Märkisches quarter (see no. 330) and Gropiusstadt arose, each with 17,000 apartments. At the I same time, the period of Promoterism town so criticized by Modernism was eliminated in great style by the clear-cut redevelopment in order to create further large residential areas. Innovative building types were required mainly for the ideal of equal opportunities announced as part of the educational reform of 1964. Thus the trendy high-level centre of Swinemünder Straße (see no. 342) became one of the few expressive addresses in West Berlin in the early years of the Berlin Wall.
It must be said that the egalitarian spirit celebrated its true triumphs where it had always been espoused: in I the ""capital of the GDR”, If, since the foundation of the GDR, around one sixth of the citizens had turned their backs : on it, it saw itself as consolidated by the I construction of the Berlin Wall: the disruptive critics largely had migrated. At
the same time, in one fell swoop, 110,000 workers who had previously been hired out in West Berlin were “brought home* to the “paradise* of the working people. The population losses before the Berlin Wall was built could be compensated for within the next two decades. Since the open competition of systems had ceased to exist, the collective could now develop in its pure form. As a key project the socialist city centre (see no. 309) was now realized. Since even the best comrade also sometimes needed a rest from the harmony of the collective, however, “dachas"", the eastern variant of the allotment garden, soon began to proliferate into the city’s surroundings.
So the division of Berlin basically had a levelling effect on both halves of the city. On both sides, a provision mentality also became established. When the Berlin Wall finally fell and normality arrived, there were therefore often hysterical reactions because of fear of a loss of traditional benefices."
Praise for the Slab: Industrial Building in East Berlin,Concept,Post Modern Period: 1979-1989,,Jägerstraße 56,52.514275,13.3939041,,"The industrial building goes back to research on the Bauhaus style in the 1920s. It is considered an attempt to connect social requirements in terms of mass residential construction with design elements. Through the rationalization of the building process, the procedures in the construction of buildings were to be accelerated in order to provide as many people as possible in the shortest possible time with a newly built apartment - with the comfort of heating, running water and an inside toilet. On top of this was the aesthetic and ideological requirement to provide the simple workers and farmers with housing which would contribute to an area-wide visual improvement of the cities. The industrial prefabrication was pushed on so far that even special building parts were not produced on location at the construction site but instead already beforehand In the manufacturing facilities.
In the GDR it was Hans Schmidt who, in the mid-1950s as the main architect at the Institute for Standardization, compiled theoretical principles which found recognition in the entire Eastern Block. Schmidt had already attracted attention back in 1924 as the publisher of the magazine ABC - Contributions to Building. He was convinced that the “new architecture could grow only on the technical basis of industrialization and on the social basis of socialism” and propagated the design of buildings from industrially prefabricated components or even the assembly of repetitive facade elements as an architectural principle. Among his German colleagues, who still felt fully associated with neo-traditionalism at the time, the born Swiss was greeted with the head shaking and rejection at first. Nevertheless, with his theses, Hans Schmidt was able to initiate a development in the GDR which influenced the entire Eastern Block. The idea of saving time and, in particular, money from the rationalization of the building process became the ideology of an entire generation of architects. According to Schmidt’s ideas, the architects should learn in particular during their education to implement the “architecturally-conditional tectonics of industrial construction” in their designs. This is because the clear, simple and uniform correspond the best with the essence of socialistic society. But the repeatedly formulated demand to also help form an assumed new society with a new building process could be solved by the architects only with politically extremely high-ranking prototype residential areas. Material shortages and lack of workers, caused by erroneous calculations in the central plans of a rigid party and state apparatus, ultimately led to the fact that the idea of an area-wide architectural renewal of society ended in an economic and creative disaster."
Hermann Henselmann,Architect,International Style: 1961-1979,1905 in Roßla (Harz) - 1995 Berlin,Fernsehturm,52.520815,13.4094191,,"“People have nothing against being called typical citizens of a state but they have a lot against being called typified. ”
Hermann Henselmann, 1967
Whether retro style as with Stalinallee (see no. 294) or a futuristic form like with the Fernsehturm (no. 322): Hermann Henselmann predetermined what is today known as the best architecture of the GDR. Here he was rather unloved as a colleague, neither a perfect nor principled planner and (according to his own manifest) everything but a worker.
Maybe his success is explained by the fact that he represented the opposite of the type of person desired by socialism: the self-promoter.
Henselmann grew up in Bernburg (Saale) as the son of a cabinet maker. After an apprenticeship as a joiner he refused to take over his father’s business, however, and went to Berlin to study interior design and architecture at the School of Craftsmen and Applied Arts. He led the life of a bohemian, reading the “Weltbühne”, listening to lectures of the socialist art historian Max Deri and mak-
ing his way as a draft illustrator. His main role model was Le Corbusier, whom he met in 1930. Near Geneva, Henselmann completed the Kenwin Villa, which could also have originated from his idol. It had, admittedly, been designed by the film architect Ferency who died during the construction work. However, Henselmann passed off the building solely as his own work.
However, Henselmann was unable to assert himself with his own powers. The four homes he realised by 1934 had to alienate planning craftsmen, civil builders and National Socialist “culture guardians*: when the Kampfbund für deutsche Kultur, the battle league for German culture demanded the demolition of his work at Weinmeisterhöhe, which was disparaged as “bolshevist building”, Henselmann knew that he had no chance in the Third Reich. In 1941 he was excluded from the Reichskammer der bildenden Künste, the Reich’s chamber of fine arts, as a “half-Jew”. Despite this, he still managed to maneuver by stealth and keep his head above water with civil contracts: with his talent for drawing he was soon decorating estates in the Warta region with blood and soil jewelry and therefore avoided army duty.
At the end of the war, Henselmann was forty. Now the communists were to enable him to pursue his longed-for career. In July 1945, the provisional supervision of the Weimar College of Architecture was transferred to him. When this was reorganised he tied in with the traditions of the Bauhaus style which had been founded In 1919 at the same location by Walter Gropius. Under Henselmann’s supervision there were model plans for collective houses, and finally he was given a post in Berlin which had to be seen as strategic for the structural development of the GDR: at the newly founded German Bauakademie, he became director of the Institute for Theory and History of Architecture in 1951, which assessed German building traditions as commissioned by the state. So he was there when in the summer there was to be a signal for construction at the later Stalinallee: admittedly his visions for the high-rise at Weberwiese (no. 274) were able to dissuade the SED leadership from embarking on its wedding cake style ideal just as little as those of his rivals. But just as vocal as Henselmann was in this discussion as a defender of Modernism (so that only he was personally attacked in the SED-newspaper “Neues Deutschland”), he was equally quick to follow the party line afterwards. The alternative, already previously laid down by his colleagues, was awarded the contract and Hermann Henselmann was generally recognised as the main representative of GDR architecture.
He used his special position to exert influence. Soon nobody who was interested in East German architecture could get by Henselmann anymore. His residence in Pankow was one of the few open houses in the GDR. His attempts to keep the prefabricated residential areas away from the norm admittedly ended with the formal rounding off of Leninplatz. He was more successful in influencing the symbolism of the state: as an unofficial participant he designed, in the centre competition in 1958, the picture of a tower of signals in a place where a government high-rise was required. At first this move cost him- his position as Berlin’s chief architect which he had held since 1953. But finally it became apparent that only politically neutral city crowns could be implemented: so with the Television Tower (no. 322) a highly visible new statement was made which was never achieved in this form in the West. It is so universal that it is now appreciated by most people across all borders."
"If the New Becomes Old, then the Old is Renewed: 1979-1989",Era,Post Modern Period: 1979-1989,,Oranienstraße 183,52.5002581,13.4203296,,"""“Anyone who remembers the Eighties did not experience them”, the Austrian pop star Falco summed up the widespread feeling that the penultimate decade of the 20th century ended like it was hit by lightning followed only by amazement as the changes in the reunified Germany took place.
In the 1970s, East Berlin experienced a huge improvement in its reputation thanks to the recognition of the GDR by Western states. The associated arrival of diplomats gave this part of the city a certain international flair. At the same time, however, the system comparison closed in again on the GDR increasingly: Western television did not stop at any wall. By arousing consumption desires in East German living rooms which could not be fulfilled, it put the standard of living in the East in a particularly unfavourable light. Since Erich Honecker had assumed office, the solution of the supply question therefore had the highest priority.
In the area of construction this led to the passing of the apartment building programme. In Marzahn (see no. 358) at the start of the 1980s the biggest residential area of the GDR was completed. The primacy of apartment building caused high deficits: thoroughly desired ideologically, the old building substance was systematically abandoned to decline so that in 1989 every fifteenth apartment was uninhabitable.
The immaterial damage was even higher though: the development of socialism had become a monotonous process which had to quench creativity. Normal citizens whom it helped get a new apartment did not see themselves as animated for involvement in collective ideals and instead were incited to withdraw into their private lives and consumption.
This is how the GDR increasingly lost support among the population. The SED heads became increasingly defensive and reacted with the expansion of the police informer system of state security. At the same time, they went without adhering too strictly to sublime ideological principles and thought increasingly of Prussian traditions. The symbolic act of the 1980s was therefore not the establishment of the Marx-Engels-Forum (no. 357) but the return of the monument of the Prussian King Friedrich II, who was once vilified as reactionary, to its original home on Unter den Linden at around the same time. Generally the most remarkable efforts in the capital were geared towards the vedutes of the past. East Berlin was caught up by history.
West Berlin, however, had now recovered from the shock of the Berlin Wall being built. Life had largely returned to normal thanks to the ease of travelling through the GDR enabled by the Four Power Agreement. This development led not only to increased arrivals from the Federal Republic but also to the fact that West Berlin could now think of itself again. A real tourist boom also began now. And the visitors were also less interested in the newly built tower blocks than in the aura of Berlin - and this had its roots in history. So the determination of the past and no longer the swan song for the old soon dominated the discourse: “attempt at a balance” was the programmatic title of the large Prussia exhibition in 1981.
The young generation had also long since discovered the old, unrenovated parts of the city as free space. In Kreuzberg particularly, there developed an alternative culture whose spearhead was the taz which had been published since 1979 - a new foundation in Berlin which there had not been anything similar for a long time! This scene was ready to start civil war to defend its way of life. But it did not come to this because the “Western system” - unlike the GDR - showed itself capable of reform. The clear-cut renovation was stopped. Mayor Richard von Weizsäcker pacified the city after 1981 by concluding contracts with the squatters and even making them owners.
A new, active cultural life developed. In 1984 the International Building Exhibition (see no. 355) was organized. The change became evident mainly in view of the fact that the once written-off outpost of the free world was named “European Capital of Culture” in 1988."""
The International Building Exhibition 1984/87,Concept,Post Modern Period: 1979-1989,,Pragerplatz,52.4929459,13.333031,,"As a result of the International Building Exhibition (IBA), approximately 4,000 publicly funded apartments and their infrastructure had been newly built. In the same way, many were repaired and a good dozen empty factories were reused as culture factories, in backyards greenery was planted and parks were created. Even if this only represented, at best, a fraction of what was built in the walled city of Berlin during this time, the IBA became the most important architecture project of the 1980s in the world.
Clear priority settings contributed to the success of the IBA: the Berlin Senate had sanctioned its programme as the ""‘inner city as residential estate”. Subsequently, the IBA invested more than three billion Deutschmarks in the parts of the city, which the Berlin building policy had neglected in the post-war period. In over 160 individual projects, new city building concepts, which had only been realized as prototypes at best until then, were used for the first time on a broader front.
Hardt-Waltherr Hämer started a change of thought As the director of the Altbau-IBA, which carried out the refurbishment of old buildings in Berlin, he faced up to the social present of the city in the east of Kreuzberg. He viewed the colorful mix of squatters, Turks and other fringe groups, who lived there and had been considered as part of the problem up to then, much more as part of the solution. He backed self-help, which made those concerned into property owners. In the course of the “Careful Urban Renewal”, which he implemented instead of wholesale redevelopment, he succeeded in maintaining all the old buildings.
On the other hand, Josef Paul Kleihues (see no. 356), the director of the IBA-Neubau, the section of the IBA which carried out new development in Berlin, focused on western Kreuzberg, the Tiergarten district, Prager Platz and the Tegel Harbour, by rehabilitating the historical city structure, which had only been amputated over four decades, into the future model. In accordance with the method of “Critical Reconstruction”, which offered compliance to the former plots, alignment and eaves heights, the city, craggy due to war and demolition, was expanded with (mostly post-modern) avant-garde architecture.
Through a multitude of publications as well as through numerous exhibitions and symposiums, which were organised in this context, it was guaranteed that the IBA and its methods were not only discussed by the trade public through-out the entire world, but also that it gained immense popularity with the public at large. He, who had never been past Kreuzberg before, could finally recognize the value of a Gründerzeit remise himself.
In fact, the multiplication effects were enormous, not just for Berlin. Not only that the written-off walled metropolis had caught up with the world level in the field of architecture. The city and its history were generally rediscovered. To develop it further instead of breaking with it has become a globally established strategy of urban planning since that time.
In the meantime, the star of the IBA shined so brightly that its failings were barely noticed. What urbanists are happy to label with the buzz word “sustainability” today, obtained at best at that time a formal corset: the IBA city continued to present itself without core functions. Industry, once an obvious part of urban multi-purpose use, continued to move into the industrial estates. This meant, in the end, the then so disapproved-of “sleeping sites of the modern age” were only prettied up into fixed locations which were just as unproductive. Because the IBA only built council apartments, which were then additionally subsidized, it even encouraged the illusion of a continuously progressing all-round welfare."
Josef Paul Kleihues,Architect,Post Modern Period: 1979-1989,1933 Rheine - 2004 Berlin,Fasanenstrasse 81,52.5051229,13.3284813,,"“The rediscovery of the laws of the historic city was as obvious as it was essential.”
Josef Paul Kleihues, 1987
A discreet pair of glasses, a precise, but by no means loud voice - the self-confidence of having written architectural history in this city was expressed in every nuance. Josef Paul Kleihues was the doyen of Berlin’s architects. He had a decisive influence on what was built in this city in the last two decades.
Kleihues came from the Westphalian town of Rheine, a town whose Genius
Loci is determined by qualities such as solidity, constancy and a certain down-to-earth nature - qualities which had a considerable influence on the son of a building contractor.
The architecture studies in Berlin were characterized by the late expressionist anthropocentrics of Hans Scharoun (see no. 281). After his degree, he went to the. Paris Ecole des Beaux-Arts where, at the time, the conflict was raging between the defenders of the fine arts and the young representatives of the enlightenment, which, at the end of the sixties, would encompass the whole of society. Kleihues dealt with all these trends intellectually - but never really warmed to them.
It was his own combination of savoir vivre and roots which helped Kleihues succeed in West Berlin, where he had opened his office in 1961. The experts were astonished when, in 1973 with the construction of the new Neukölln hospital, he preserved the substance of the old building and cautiously added to it - a real novelty at the time. Together with Wolf Jobst Siedler, he initiated a series of articles on town planning questions in the Berliner Morgenpost in 1977. This ultimately convinced the Senate to implement the biggest support action conceivable for architects: the organisation of the International Building ExhilMat (IBA) {see no. 355).
Kleihues became director of its new building section and here he was so undogmatic as to also invite architects whose aesthetic views he did not share - which helped make Berlin, with the IBA, one of the world’s architecture 'capitals. The most promising heads of the world such as Daniel Libeskind and Zaha Hadid were thus given their first opportunity to build. Kleihues used the budget of 85 million made available to him here to a not inconsiderable extent in order to make the results of this workshop known worldwide. Soon even the US magazine Time was recognizing “the organization of the most ambitious display of this generation in world architectural standards”.
Here, Kleihues gave the global spirit of the age only limited scope. The star architects were able to indulge in details - but he still largely provided the guidelines: the houses must be built on the basis of the traditional city, i.e. under consideration of the historic ground plan. The principle of “critical reconstruction” was actually revolutionary on the River Spree. This is because Berlin had, for at least a hundred years, been used to implementing every concoction without asking questions. But since 1968 the criticism of the modern bad been articulated, and the resumption of historic continuity appeared as the only possible prospect for the future within the Wall.
When the “anti-fascist protective wall” then fell, the IBA director had already taken the critical reconstruction so far to success that there could be no alternatives to this. While Senate Building Director Hans Stimmann (no. 404) accepted its implementation, Kleihues, as an “architect with an integrated building permit”, was given dozens of opportunities to put his ideas into his own buildings. He was probably most successful in the balancing act between traditional and modern with the Kant Triangle whose weather vane roof has to be seen as homage to the dancer Josephine Baker, who celebrated her triumphs in the “Golden Twenties” in the Theater des Westens lying opposite. But usually he remained as strict as with his first building, Block 270 (no. 340).
Finally Josef Paul Kleihues also rendered outstanding services in another area: In 2000 with a much-visited exhibition, in which the Berlin architecture history of the 20th century was recapitulated, he prepared the foundation for a local architecture museum. The fact that he deserves an outstanding place in this is indisputable."
The New City of Berlin: Construction Work in the 1990s,Era,New Berlin: 1989-Present,,Pariser Platz,52.5162038,13.3782795,,"The 1990s could hardly have had unified greater contrasts in terms of their urban development role models and economic expectations. While the city’s population was expected to grow to reach a figure of five million citizens, the expectations that were excessive in some cases have markedly calmed down. No one wanted to speak of a booming city ten years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Berlin's population decreased from 1996 onwards, a trend that has only reversed over the last few years. The Senate has incurred follow-up costs, which only future generations will be able to pay off, due to gigantic investments in infrastructure while the tax revenue was absent. Despite this sobering end result Berlin has become a Mecca of modern architecture since Germany’s reunification. You will hardly find any more markedly contrasting philosophies of architecture anywhere else in the world - with the consequence Berlin is extremely polarized in terms of its planning and construction work. Passionate debates have been held about architecture and urban development especially since the reunification of Germany, which has provided Berlin with a surge in development activities that is unique in history. Upon the dismantling of the scaffolding a city has emerged following the boom of the 1990s, which is more modern than many others, which establishes links with long forgotten traditions and has revealed an astonishing level of diversity. In the past ten years numerous architects from all round the world have embarked on a search for a design for the city in competitions. Each of them has made a contribution ensuring that Berlin has found its own architectural style.
The Berlin architecture dispute, which reached its climax between 1993 and 1995 and at the same time also led to personal animosities arising between the architects, created a big stir throughout the world. This is due to the fact that Berlin has always been a trendsetter for contemporary architecture. This raised expectations in the modern architecture to such an extent after 1990 that the response to the reconstruction of city that had been divided for decades had to be a sobering one. Rather than a city idea, which should have imitated the ideals of long since obsolete city utopias, the Senate awarded a prize to designs, which had some elements that are typical Berlin, but which nevertheless regarded as an absolute provocation by the international architecture sector, in numerous competitions and expert reports. Almost without exception the Senate pursued a strategy of “critical reconstruction” during the reconstruction of Berlin in accordance with the role model of a traditional European city. In specific terms this means that the historic city ground plan has to be restored in those places, where it was meaningful from our current perspective. This applies for instance to the areas at the Leipziger Platz, Pariser Platz or in Friedrichstadt a new city structure was developed where there were hardly any relics of the old city, whereby the houses are oriented towards the road, form a clear address and are based on the typology of Berlin's office blocks with their characteristic cullis height of 72 feet. In addition there was the fact - and this really heated the debate up - a fundamental specification for the use of materials: The faces were to be designed in natural stone just like the historical models that they were based on. As a consequence this led to a situation whereby a lot of the raw buildings were integrated quite naturally. Exceptions such as the Galeries Lafayette department store (no. 394) are all the more conspicuous as a result. They form a kind of opposition in the “new centre of stone buildings”.
In addition to the discussion about architectural details Berlin also initiated a series of major urban development policy decisions, which the urban planners had worked towards for almost 80 years as in the case of the Tiergarten tunnel. Berlin fulfilled the dream of a gigantic traffic hub right in the middle of the city centre through the decision to build the Berlin central station and the resulting necessity to create a north-south axis for transport."
Hans Stimmann,Architect,New Berlin: 1989-Present,141 (Lubeck) -,Leipziger Pl.,52.509605,13.3779332,,"*Berlin’s key concern is sustained urban development, which relates history and the future to one another. ”
Hans Stimmanap 1999
The man with the snow-white hair has a fiery temperament! Berlin discovered this after Hans Stimmann had become the city’s building director in 1991. A few weeks later, he dismissed proposals for the new development of Potsdamer Platz (no. 412), which renowned property developers had pressed ahead with, as “childish”, “unrealistic” or “stupid”.
It may be the case that the state tasks are being privatized everywhere: Stimmann insisted upon public leadership. He wanted streets, square and blocks of houses that were based upon historical ground plans, lines of buildings and eaves heights.
The billionaire investor Eduard Reuter who had visions of an American city with high-rise buildings and shopping immediately felt as if he had been whisked away into a provincial “hamlet”. In this process, the tradition of the European city was already successfully revived by Josef Paul Kleihues (no. 356) during the International Building Exhibition at the start of the 1980s. Stimmann simply updated the strategy and implemented it in a more universal manner. He was able to do this because everyone wanted to invest in Berlin as quickly as possible at that time. And also because the city of Berlin had provided Stimmann with something that no Berlin building director had had before him - the rank of a state secretary.
However* his biography ensures that this, by his own account, “powerful man” does not have his head in the clouds. The worth of the city was never called into question in his home city of Lübeck where he was the building inspector from 1986 until 1991. After his apprenticeship as a mason, he then went on to complete his training as a design engineer. The American office in Frankfurt/Main, in which he was only allowed to design refineries in the mid-1960’s, dismissed him as soon as orders became absent.
He moved to the turbulent city of Berlin in the politically heated 1970s In which there were lot of lively debates, in order to complete his doctorate in urban planning at the Technical University of Berlin.
He was called to Berlin in 1991 and governed in a decisive manner as the “aesthetic arm of the senator”. He patronized purist Prussian master builders who had to rein in their imagination and work on the craftsmanship details as well as solid stone. Ultimately his diktat of taste made the term “New Berlin” into a trademark that could be recognized throughout the world, which is not anachronistic in the age of globalization, but rather of essential importance for the city.
Stimmann made the most constructive contribution towards Berlin’s inner-city life after he was transferred to the urban development administration in 1996. He presented so-called “master plans” for the city as well as the outskirts of the city. They present the city in a form that could not be any livelier: as an organism with a heart and extremities, which both contribute towards its particular characteristics. This is revolutionary for Berlin, which had lived in parallel universes at the time when the Wall existed. The reactions have been correspondingly intense, not least due to the colonialist manner in which Stimmann dealt with the eastern Berlin milieu. Yet this time, he entered into dialogue with them because he did not have any power bar the power of his arguments. In an unparalleled process of co-determination, Stimmann’s “master plan” became a generally accepted city agenda. The New Centre force had found itself in 1999 at least in the minds of those responsible.
In his third term of office, Stimmann devoted himself to the realization of the “master plan” (no. 487), even though he is now more moderate in his approach - particularly in terms of style. Nevertheless, scandals connected to the financing of Peter Zumthor’s concept for the documentation centre Topographie des Terrors (no. 530) as well as the redevelopment of the Spreedreieck caused him difficulties.
What remained after his retirement from office is the impact of his aesthetic and planning parameters that still polarize architects nationally and internationally. Irrespective of this, he has achieved more for the city during his 15 years in office than any other building official of the current age. By critically reconstructing the urban space, he made historical traces Berlin, destroyed during the war, visible again and shaped the face of lisp metropolis like no one else since the reunification."
Potsdamer Platz: City Model of the Future?,Concept,New Berlin: 1989-Present,,Potsdamer Platz,52.5096488,13.3759441,,"Potsdamer Platz is something like an urban development fulcrum between the East and the West. For decades, the Berlin Wall (no. 301) ran straight across the square. The most recent history of the square, which has become a synonym of the “new city of Berlin"", already started in the 1980s when plans were discussed for the “central area”. The basic idea at that time was to breathe new life into this peripheral inner-city area, which then led to the Daimler-Benz automotive group purchasing a plot of land, running from the Landwehrkanal to the wall zone, immediately prior to the fall of the Wall. The Wall fell whilst the contractual negotiations were still progressing, and a peripheral city location became a top site in the centre of a European city with a population of several million people virtually overnight.
The Senate launched an urban development competition, which the Munich-based architects Heinz Hilmer and Christoph Sattler won in the autumn of 1991,"" The master plan envisaged once again providing the former wasteland with the appearance of a European metropolis. In specific terms, this meant that the basic urban development' structure would adopt the block model of the Berlin city centre and was expected to emphasize the variety of uses of the city by means of mixing residential, working, cultural and shopping buildings.
The supposed recourse to a historical model of the city was not without its critics. Other architects who took part in the competition dreamt of the invention of a new type of cityscape that had never existed before or the implantation of an American city in the heart of Berlin. A passionate dispute between the architects involved ensued following this, which attracted the attention of the world’s media. This is because the points were supposed to be set for Berlin's future development at Potsdamer Platz.
Renzo Piano’s (Genoa/Paris) and Helmut Jahn’s (Chicago) ideas for the
specification of the master plan won through, who were commissioned by the large investors Daimler-Benz (now called: Daimler AG) and SONY. Whilst Piano enlisted the services of several other architects and provided a certain level of architectural diversity on the part of the 19 buildings in total (see nos. 398,460,467) Jahn provided a design forming “a united and integrated whole”. Hence the two largest projects to the west of Potsdamer Platz could not be any more different. SONY presented a homogeneous glass-steel form of architecture, which permitted a Plaza to be constructed in its centre. Daimler created a traditional European cityscape made of different individual buildings and narrow streets. The fact that the area was constructed at the end of the 20th century despite having a city typology that had been developed in the 19th century, cannot be overlooked: an underground car park with direct access to the Tiergarten tunnel pays homage to the product, which provided the proceeds to make all this possible - the car.
An equally significant project has been built as the final module around Potsdamer Platz. The Lenne-Dreieck by the investor Beisheim. In 2007, both SONY and Daimler announced the planned sale of their premises. In December 2007, Daimler sold its premises with the Potsdamer Platz arcades to the real estate branch of the Scandinavian private bank SEB, while remaining the main tenant of the building until 2012."
New Suburbs: Apartments for Citizens who aren't coming after all,Concept,New Berlin: 1989-Present,,Karow,52.6117109,13.4824597,,"When the first prognosis for the reunified capital city were created from 1990, the demographics surpassed themselves with audacious reflections. Up to 2010, it was estimated that Berlin would house up to five million people. It had already experienced such a boom before, at the end of the 19th century: within a short number of decades, the population at that time doubled. In 1939, the city already had five million inhabitants. No wonder then, if the city’s development politics created space for the prognosed *New Berliners” with huge investment housing programmes. A city concept from the 19th century was revived: the suburb. At the same time, the decision for such city expansions was a refusal of the current trends in city development in other European metropolises, whose borders are not characterised through urban structures but through “wild growth”. All the projects were carried out in this sense, which were developed under the names of Neu-Karow, Französisch Buchholz, Rudower Felder etc.
Without a doubt, the most famous project is Neu-Karow - a suburb for about 5,000 inhabitants in Northeast Berlin. On the basis of a traditional city layout with streets, squares, and parks (design: Moore, Ruble, Yudell), within a few years, multi-story apartment blocks, apartment biases and terraces as well as schools, childcare facilities and shopping centres developed, Even if Neu-Karow was something of an experimental field for lots of young architects, the result is still sobering. Only a few buildings stand out from the masses because of their quality. The reason for this could be the rapid planning and construction time, through which otherwise consecutive planning stages were connected in parallel and implementation plant were drawn up without any binding development plan. Nevertheless, the suburb projects deserve recognition: In Neu-Karow, au-
thorities and investors entered into a Public-Private-Partnership, in which reduced development areas were sold to private project developers, who were then obligated on their side to create public infrastructures. The experiences with this well received concept introduced a new regulation of the so-called town planning contract, which has been anchored in the German Federal Building Code since 1998."
"New Old Capital: Novelty on the one Hand, Continuity on the Other",Concept,New Berlin: 1989-Present,,Platz der Republik,52.518585,13.3731851,,"20th June 1991 can be entered into the most significant dates in the youngest history of Berlin, after 3rd October 1990: with a tight majority, the Deutsche Bundestag voted in favour of transferring the seat of the government from Bonn to Berlin. Since the foundation of the Deutsches Reich, Berlin has administered uninterrupted capital and governmental functions. The city has a large spectrum of political buildings due to these functions. In addition, every era on the Spree has written new architectural history. This Is because with every new political system, the requirements on the city’s representation have changed. In this way, the Reichstag (no. 106) did not just embody the Kaiserzeit. It also formed a town planning counterweight to the Stadtschloss der Hohenzollern (no. 7) due to its monumentality. Even when the Volksvertreter (people’s representatives) in the Reichstag still did not have the political power of a parliament in today’s sense-of the word, the growing democracy manifested itself with a powerful building in the cityscape.
The political architecture of the Weimar Republic on the Other hand did not reach beyond the planning for the capital due to its frequent government changes. For the square in front of the Reichstag, after unsuccessful participation in the competition to expand the Reichstag, Hugo Haring put forward designs far a “Democratic Forum” in 1929. On a semicircular rostrum opening out towards the Reichstag, the people would be able to “take a seat” in the truest sense of the word and be able to enter into a symbolic interplay between parliament and public. Over sixty years later, the winners of the Spreebogen competition of 1993, Axel Schultes and Charlotte Frank took up this idea of a place for citizens again with the Bundesforum.
The cautious attempt in the Weimar Republic to formulate an architectonic expression for a democratic system, was initially ended with the assumption of power by the National Socialists. From 1933, numerous governmental buildings developed in Berlin, which were characterized by a clear tectonic organisation and stone solidity. On Wilhelmstraße, for example, between the years of 1934 and 1936, the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (no. 229) was erected in accordance with plans by Ernst Sagebiel. With the new construction on the corner of leipziger Straße, the Third Reich continued a tradition of governmental buildings, which had begun in the middle of the 19th century in Prussia: the extension of Wilhelmstraße to a governmental axis. After demolishing the Reichskanzlei and the Reichspräsidentenpalais, the over-dimensioned Neue Reichskanzlei (no. 248) developed there between 1937 and 1939 from a plan made by Albert Speer (no. 225). The1 Neue Reichskanzlers gallery of mirrors had gigantic dimensions of almost 500 feet.
A transfer Of political power from Wilhelmstraße began with the division of Berlin. The GDR had their most important political buildings constructed in the area of the Spree Island, among which the Staatsratsgebäude (no. 308) and the Palast der Republik (no. 337). Not far away, the central committee of the SED took up residence in the former Reichsbank (no. 450), which is still used today as the official residence of the Auswärtiges Amt and has come to stand exemplarily for a new self-image of the Federal Republic of Germany: the political and structural legacy of governmental buildings of past - mostly undemocratic - systems is not covered up. Instead it is put into a new context with the help of conversions or new buildings. The numerous governmental and parliamentary locations from the different eras contribute therefore to the fact that the Berlin cityscape has become a type of open-air museum of the political architecture in Germany."
Berlin's Inner-City Plan: Strategy for the Coming Decades,,New Berlin: 1989-Present,,Friedrichswerder,52.5145737,13.3988008,,"In November 1996, the Senate of Berlin presented an extensive plan for the centre of Berlin under the title “Planwerk Innenstadt Berlin”, Berlin’s inner-city plan. Deliberately, the first presentation was made in the framework of the Stadtforum as a prelude for a “dialogic” urban renewal. In open discussion, the preliminary plans for both the teams of Manfred Ortner/Fritz Neumeyer (City West) and Bernd Albers/Dieter Hoff-mann-Axthelm (historical centre) were debated in more than 30 planning workshops and 20 public Stadtforum discussions until May 1999, when the Senate’s plans were agreed as the binding central theme for the coming 30 years, and the requirements were adapted to the people concerned. Hans Stimmann (no. 404) is the spiritual father of the Planwerk Innenstadt. At this time, he was acting in the function as state secretary for urban development management.
The Berlin Planwerk Innenstadt can claim to be the first Berlin inner-city plans, which went through with declared urban economic objectives. The fundamental suggestion of the Planwerk was: inner development precedes external development; that means development of a functioning inner-city core instead of sprawling across the surrounding countryside. This approach demands breaking with the planning objective of the modern age, to dismember the city into mono-functional large areas. Instead of this, the approach intends the creation of smaller units of social and function mixing and co-determination of the plots to the point of the city quarter. The Planwerk Innenstadt led to a passionate argument between partisans and critics of the modern style in the specialist community, which also brought itself to international attention.
Particularly innovative is the conversion of the abstract planning objectives. In this way, Senate-owned plots in the inner city were to be sold off at a cheap price to allow the building of residential buildings in immediate city locations. The background for such considerations are the comprehensive calculations, according to which every new apartment on the periphery of the city would result in investments in the public infrastructure. With the attempt to develop the inner city more strongly than before as a residential area as well, the Senate would like to counteract the persistent exodus from the city centre.
As one of the larger projects that would not have been possible without this debate, 50 town houses on plots with a width of over 200 feet were developed in the Friedrichswerder quarter by the end of 2006. On filet plots between the Auswärtiges Amt and Gendarmenmarkt, 50 private landowners had the chance to reconstruct a piece of the urban settlement area - the heart of every traditional European city. Despite the strict design regulations, the impressive ensemble exemplifies what successful urban architecture can look like today if building sites are not only realized on a large scale.
In 2007, Regula Lüscher accepted office as Senate Building Director for Urban Development and introduced a new concept of urban development. On the basis of Stimmann's concepts, the Planwerk Innenstadt was revised and methodically and spatially adjusted to meet the city's current development. Berlin began to grow again and required new strategies for the future. Thus it was decided in 2011, to implement the “Planwerk Innere Stadt” plan, which also includes developments on the outskirts of the inner city. Major planning projects include the development of Europacity, a new city district to the north of the central station, as well as the former Tempelhof Airport (no. 249). The controversy surrounding these two projects show that discussions about Berlin’s urban development are far from over."
Conservation and Expansion of Neues Museum and Museumsinsel Master Plan,Concept,New Berlin: 1989-Present,,Neues Museum,52.5201349,13.3976462,,"The Neues Museum, the main work of Friedrich August StüIer, today contains the collection of the Ägyptisches Museum (Egyptian Museum), the Museum fur Vor- und Frühgeschichte (Museum of prehistory) as well as parts of the Antikensammlung (collection of antiquities) of Berlin. Reconstruction of the parts damaged during the war only commenced in 1986, during which the remnants of the famous Ägyptischer Hof (Egyptian Courtyard) were also removed. »Reunification put an end to the planned true-to-the-original reconstruction (for which the corner stone was laid in 1989). Within the scope of the master plan for the Museumsinsel (until around 2025), the reconstruction was implemented from 1999 according to new plans by David Chipperfield. The competition announced in 1993 for the master plan to reorganize the entire museum grounds (restoration of the Alte Nationalgalerie (no. 89) until 2001 by HG Merz, restoration and expansion of the Bodemuseum (no. 131) until 2005 by Heinz Tesar, Altes Museum (no. 62), Pergamonmuseum (no. 153)) was originally won by Georg Grassi, against competitors such as Frank O. Gehry, who nevertheless withdrew from the plan in 1996.
Chipperfield's plans that include, in addition to the reconstruction of the Neues Museum, also a new main entrance with visitors’ centre, the James Simon gallery near the Kupfergraben and standardized access to the buildings (underground as an archaeological promenade or above ground as a colonnade), were adopted.
In 1997 he was commissioned by the Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz (Prussian cultural heritage fund) to reconstruct the Neues Museum. Chipper-field’s restoration particularly focused on the entirely destroyed northwestern wing and the projection on the southeastern side. He based his design on the volume of the Classicist building, while simplifying the details to such a degree that the wounds of the building and their healing were clearly distinguishable from the original structure. At first glance, the recycled brick tiles are the same color as the quarry stone of the old building, yet a second look reveals the look of a raw building deprived of its whitewashed surface and upon closer inspection it is clearly visible as an annex to the building. This attitude of a rigorously modern ""complementary reconstruction* without dwelling on the destruction and without emphasizing the contrast of old and new was already successfully applied by Hans Döllgast in the reconstruction of the Alte Pinakothek in Munich (1952-57). The reconstruction clearly distinguished between the existing structures and the additions, with entirely contemporary additions, yet allows the original building to be seen more or less complete and unaltered, while also maintaining its ruin character in the completed building. On the other hand, the respect for the original elements that does not permit the mixing with historicizing but newly created elements, was severely criticized in Berlin as many citizens and various interest groups desired a true-to-original reconstruction as planned by the GDR. ä Chipperfield’s conservation also incorporates as much as possible the original furnishings - Germany’s only surviving late Classicist museum interior - complementing missing parts in an obvious way without interpreting the existing segments fj a method that was also successful for the monument protection conservation of the fragmented remains of works of art. Original remnants of later changes (such as from the 1920s) were also preserved. However, totally missing parts, such as the frescos by Wilhelm von Kaulbach in the large staircase, were not copied. This space is among the best Berlin has to offer today."

The current triple nave structure with cross vault was erected in 1380 following a devastating fire. In 1452 the Marienkapelle, with its ornate fable was financed. For centuries, the church had just one octagonal spire. In 1876 a second tower was added in brick and three spires. The church was severely damaged towards the end of World War II with the interior gutted by fire and most of the pillars collapsing in the scope of the reconstruction for the 750 year anniversary of Berlin the church was reconstructed as a museum a process that enabled the many fittings that have been stored elsewhere to be replaced in their original position the early history of Berlin to the end of the 30 years war can be traced here."

The brick construction was directed under the influence of the Craftsmans guild who worked on the Brandenburg cathedral in the second half of the 13th century. In keeping with the traditions of the mendicant order, the western facade had no tower. Not until 1844 were the two flanking towers added. In 1574, it became home to Gymnasium Zum Grauen Kloster, the first grammar school in Berlin. The church was heavily damaged in the second Ward, with the remains of the monastery removed in 1968 during the widening of the wellness Strasse. Today, the ruins of the church serve as an open air sculpture gallery, which works include original statues from the Berlin city Palace. There are plans to move to school now situated in the western part of the city back to this historic location. The venue is used for exhibitions Theater performances and concerts."

The hospital, including the chapel, was first mentioned in 1272, and was demolished in 1825. Only the chapel remains today. The early Gothic brick construction dates largely from the late 13th century and consists of a single nave room. The stone vault was added at the end of the 15th century. In 1905 the chapel was integrated into the new Handelshochschule, a commercial college.

The current pyramidal tower roof dates back to 1790 and was created by Carl Gotthard Langhans in the mix of Gothic and classical elements popular at that time. The interior is noteworthy for the Totentanz frieze and Andreas Schluter’s marble pulpit (see no. 18). The destruction in the Second World War of the densely built Marienvierte! and its subsequent demolition means that today the church stands alone and isolated."

This, the first city wall, was built in the middle of the 13th century, with the wall visible today dating from a renovation and reinforcement of the wall from the beginning of the 14th century. The original height of the wall was approximately 13 feet. Following the construction of the Baroque city fortifications in the 17th century further outside the original wall, sections of the city wall received the addition of residential dwellings. In this manner, the fragment in Waisenstraße was also retained. In the vicinity is a short row . of bourgeois houses, the core of which is Medieval, with the facade dating from the 18th century. One of these also houses the well-known tavern “Zur letzten lnstanz”."
Berlin Stadtschloss,,Baroque: 1600-1790,1450-1850,,52.5372897,13.3602743,Unkown,"Is there any other city in the civilised world with such a gaping void at its centre as Berlin? Where the main axes of the city floor plan converge in a giant, dull car park with a multipurpose building? Here, on the Spree Island, the Stadtschloss stood for 500 years. Despite surviving the war with only minor damage, it was demolished in 1950 on the orders of Walter Ulbricht, who saw the building as a symbol of Prussian militarism, and wished to create an area for mass parades on the spot. The sole surviving part of the castle was Portal IV of the Lustgarten front, integrated into the facade of the Staatsratsgebaude (no. 308) in 1964 - partially in the form of a copy. The GDR considered it to be worthy of saving due to the fact that Karl Liebknecht declared the Socialist Republic from here in 1918. The location of other fragments of the historic facades and the rubble from the demolition remains unclear to this day. Much of it is located in museums and depots, with other sections thought to be in undeveloped rubble tips around the city.
This was the end of a significant monument, one that represented the overall development of Prussian architecture like no other. Begun around 1450, it was continually extended and amended by the master builders of the time. The Baroque facade of Andreas Schliiter (no. 18) was created around 1700, based upon the Palazzo Madama in Rome. With the dome of Friedrich August Stiller, the castle received its final external appearance in 1850. The most famous part of the grounds was the easternmost of the two interior courtyards, named Schluterhof in honour of its creator.
The overwhelming significance of the Stadtschloss for Berlin lay in its urban planning function. The entire westward expansion of the city hinged upon the position and architecture of this colossus, with neighbouring structures such as the Baroque Zeughaus (no. 16), the Altes Museum (no. 62) and the Bauakademie (no. 65) by Karl Friedrich Schinkel designed for their relation to the castle. The Lustgarten frontage once formed the vanishing point of the boulevard Unter den Linden, which today merely runs into empty space.
The staging of the castle backdrop in summer 1993, a private initiative on the part of the Hamburg businessman Wilhelm von Boddien, provided an impressive insight into how the powerful bulk of the castle would reunite the disparate structures at the centre of the city. Even opponents of reconstruction found themselves swayed by this argument. After years of intense public discussion and interim use, the Palast der Republik (no. 337), built by the GDR government, was demolished between December 2006 and December 2008. In
When built in 1891, this was one of the biggest wells in the world: the Neptune Fountain on Schlossplatz. (Photograph from pre-war times)
October 2008, the ""Temporary Kunsthalle Berlin” was erected on the castle grounds. Also following intense public discourse, the Bundestag and the state of Berlin decided in 2007 to rebuild the Stadtschloss with historic facades. The cornerstone was laid in 2013, headed by architect Franco Stella. His plan provides scope for the reconstruction of three Baroque facades as well as an additional building on the eastern side of the Stadtschloss. Bearing the name “Humboldt Forum”, it will be used for exhibitions of collections belonging to the Stiftung Preussischer Kulturbesitz upon its completion in 2019."

In this wilderness, the Elector Joachim II had Caspar Theifl build a hunting lodge, directly adjoining the lake. Today, the octagonal tower remains, along with parts of the interior fittings. The plain, white-rendered building was surrounded by a horseshoe of utility buildings. In 1701, Nering and Grünberg reworked the grounds in Baroque form. Since 1932 it has been used as a state picture gallery, with the building reopening in 1949 after the removal of war damage; the first museum in Berlin to do so."
Zitadelle Spandau,Spandau Citadel,Renaissance: 1400-1601,1583,Am Juliusturm,52.5378202,13.2173285,Unkown,"The Zitadelle Spandau is one of the best-preserved fortresses in Europe. Constructed on the site of a Slavic settlement, it represented a strategically important defensive position at the gates of Berlin. Francesco Chiaramella da Gandinn designed the fortress along northern Italian lines, with four arrow shaped bastions. Work began on construction in 1560, incorporating the Juliusturm, dating from the first half of the 13th century, and other remnants of a medieval castle. The Juliusturm is the oldest secular building in Berlin. It received its current battlements in 1838, from a design by Schinke! (see no. 44). Towards the end of the 16th century, the fortress, surrounded entirely by water, was largely complete, with more buildings added in the interior of the fortress in the 19th century. The sole martial activity involving the fortress was in 1813, during the Napoleonic occupation. Today, the building houses the Heimatmuseum Spandau, a museum of local history."
Ribbeck-Haus,Ribbeck House,Renaissance: 1400-1602,1624,Breite Strafe 35,52.51581,13.40375,Unkown,"The sole surviving Renaissance building in Berlin, and even this building is anything but original 17th century in its current condition. The house was created for Georg von Ribbeck, a counsellor to the Elector, by combining two older buildings. In 1804 the four gables were replaced by a third storey - evidence of which can be seen in the different window forms. On the orders of the King, the old Renaissance dormer gable was used on the new building. The richly ornamented 17th century round arch door was also replaced by a replica in the 1960s. Since 1996, it has housed the Centre for Berlin Studies as part of the Central and State library."
Schloss Kopenick,Kopenick Palace,Baroque: 1600-1790,1681,Schlossinsel,52.4427782,13.572733,Johann Arnold Nering,"Schloss Kopenick is the oldest remaining castle in the Berlin region and the most significant Baroque secular building before Andreas Schluter (no. 18). It was built in 1677, on the southern part of an island, for Elector Friedrich, the later King Friedrich I, in Dutch Baroque style. The building was augmented by Johann Arnold Nering in the axis of the main building, with the addition of a castle chapel, two-storey gallery and the portal to the Schlossbrucke. The interior contains a twin oak stairway and stately vestibule with early Baroque ceiling stucco. Since 1963 the building has housed an arts and crafts museum with an important collection; today it is the Haus am Kulturforum (see no. 311). After extensive renovations it now contains a permanent interior design collection established in 2004."

It comprises a large Baroque parterre, extending the main axis of the castle, and an adjoining landscaped park with Luisenin-sel, ponds, waterways and bridges. Following the Second World War, the broderie parterre between castle and carp pond was reconstructed according to French engravings from the 18th century in the form created in 1737 by Jacques Blondel, with fountain basins and lateral avenues of lime trees. The park is decorated with cast iron benches in a design by Schinkel (no. 44), together with numerous sculptures, in particular from the 19th century (some of which are copies)."

Following the death of Nering, Martin Grünberg executed the plan in a simpler form. On the KlosterstraBe side, he added a porch with entrance hall and church tower, open at the top. The original plan was for this to incorporate bells intended for the collapsed Munzturm (no. 17) of Andreas Schlüter (no. 18). The church was burned out in 1944, with the upper section of the tower collapsing, together with the tower roof. The renovation of the atrium, tower remnants and nave was completed in 2004, the rebuilding of the steeple with the spire has started in 2015."
Palais Podewils,Podewils Mansion,Baroque: 1600-1793,1704,Klosterstrajle 68,52.5174293,13.4125623,Jean de Bodt,"The Palais Podewils is one of the most significant private buildings dating from the early 18th century, an example of the classically influenced Berliner Baroque. The Palais takes its name from Minister of State von Podewils, who purchased it in 1732. The front-facing house with a side wing received the addition of a further wing in 1880. The centreline of the facade is highlighted by a projection with Ionic double pillars, triangular gable and balcony. Following damage in the Second World War, the Palais was reconstructed by 1954 with a modern interior. In the GDR, the building served as Haus der Jungen Talente, literally, the house of young talent. Today it is used as a work and production site for Berlin artists and since 2009 as a second stage for the Berlin “Grips” theatre."
Zeughaus,Arsenal,Baroque: 1600-1794,1706,Unter den Linden 2,52.5181534,13.3969444,Unkown,"Karl Friedrich Schinkel (no. 44) wrote that Berlin only possessed two colossal structures - the Stadtschloss (no. 7) and the Zeughaus. Following the demolishing of the Stadtschloss, the Zeughaus advanced to become the most significant Baroque building in the city. Plans for the construction of an arsenal date back to the Great Elector. Under the reign of his son, Friedrich III, Johann Arnold Nering began construction in 1695 probably using plans by Frangois Blondel. The difficult construction continued under various project leaders: Martin Grünberg, Andreas Schlüter (no. 18), Jean de Bodt. The Frenchman designed the central projection and completed the building, which draws influences from the French Classicism of the 17th century. The decoration of the building is the work of a number of different sculptors. The heads of dying warriors by Andreas Schlüter are some of the most significant works of Baroque sculpture. In 1730, three-quarter staircases were added in two corners of the courtyard. In 1877, Friedrich Hitzig converted the building into a pantheon with armoury museum. After the Second World War, the building was reconstructed along original lines by Otto Hasler as the Museum fur Deutsche Geschichte, the museum of German history, a process that involved the replacement of a number of parapet sculptures with replicas. The building became the Deutsches Historisches Museum. It was converted by I. M. Pei until 2006 and also received an extension (see no. 492). In 2006, it became the venue of the permanent exhibition of the DHM."

The historic core of the modern-day district of Charlottenburg was created from a medieval settlement by the name of Lietzow. To the west of this, directly on the Spree, Elector Friedrich I ordered the construction of a summer residence for his wife, Sophie Charlotte. In 1695, work began on the construction of a castle built on eleven axes, to plans by Johann Arnold ,Nering. In the course of the following centuries, the residence received repeated additions and conversions, w ithout limiting the unified overall effect (see no. 28). The first expansion to a three-winged structure followed the King's coronation in 1701, and was realised by Johann Friedrich Eosander. He was later to add the 157-feet high dome. A number of streets and lines of sight in the surrounding area were focused upon this. Following the Second World War, the heavily damaged castle was initially to be demolished. Thanks to the efforts of the later director of castles and gardens, Margarethe Kuhn, a decision was taken to rebuild instead, work on which began in 1956, with the project largely completed in 1962. The Rococo, neo-ClassicIst anti Bieriermeier interior was also recreated to a significant degree, including the so-called Eosanderkapellc, containing a lavishly carved pulpit. This process included a much-lauded attempt to replace the lost ceiling paintings with abstract forms of the original colours."
Nieolai-Haus,Nicolai House,Baroque: 1600-1796,1710,Brüderstraße 13,52.5139953,13.402902,Unkown,"Only two Baroque houses survive in Brüderstraße, originally part of Colin. The Nicolai-Haus and house no. 10. It was named after the publisher and writer Friedrich Nicolai, who purchased it in 1788, making it an important meeting point for the Berlin society of the day. Built in 1674, the house received its current form around 1710. It is a simple, early Baroque rendered building, divided primarily by pilaster strips. The interior contains many original fixtures. The rear-facing transverse and side wings surrounding a courtyard are a typical housing style of Berlin. Since 2011 it is owned by the German Foundation for Monument Protection."
Landhaus Kameke,Kameke Country House,Baroque: 1600-1797,1712,Dorotheenstrajle 27,52.5190587,13.3909952,Andreas Schlüter,"Following a period without significant assignments, Schlüter constructed a suburban country house for Minister of State Ernst Bogislav van Kameke in Dorotheenstadt, near the Spree. The style took the form of the Lustgarten buildings popular at that time. Despite the failures that he had experienced in the preceding years, Schlüter demonstrates here that his architectural creativity was unbroken. This was his last construction in Berlin. While both sides of the low building were replaced by large town houses at the end of the 19th century, the Landhaus Kameke remained until the Second World War. It was severely damaged in 1943, with the ruins demolished after the war."

Following the demolition of the ruins, Richard Paulick rebuilt it as the Operncafe, with the exterior true to the original and the interior in keeping with the more modern usage. The terrace is also a creation of the post-war era. The stairway, with its wrought ironwork, was once located in Schloss Buch. Combining a number of residential houses created the original construction. The central projection in the OberwallstraBe running along the side is richly ornamented. In 1810 Heinrich Gentz added a central structure to the Unter den Linden side, connected to the Kronprinzenpalais (no. 76) via a bridge construction."
Sophienkirche,Sophien Church,Baroque: 1600-1799,1734,Große Hamburger Straße 29,52.5253451,13.3994252,Johann Friedrich Grael,"The centre of Berlin is not overrun with picturesque perspectives. One of the most attractive is the view from Große Hamburger Straße to the tower of the Sophienkirche, framed by two neo-Baroque residential buildings. The tower was superimposed on the church of 1712 in 1734. The church was built on the orders of Queen Sophie Luise, third wife of Friedrich I, as a parish church for the Span-dau suburbs. The motif is reminiscent of the collapsed Munzturm (no. 17) of Andreas Schluter (no. 18). A compact tower shaft is followed by two slimmer floors housing the bells, enclosed by a copper cupola. It is the only Baroque tower in Berlin to survive the course of the centuries. The interior of the church was redesigned in neo-Baroque style in 1892. The residential houses in GroBe Hamburger StraBe, also neo-Baroque, were built in 1905, with their symmetrical position taking the church as reference point. To the rear, Sophienstraße is one of the best-preserved and most picturesque streets of old Berlin."

Erected as an academic building in the line of sight of Markgrafenstraße, the three-winged building, later used as a superior court of justice, was converted several times in the 19th century, most significantly by Hermann Friedrich Waesemann in 1858. The building was severely damaged in the Second World War and rebuilt in the years up to 1969 as the Berlin-Museum. The end of the 1990s saw a further reconstruction, by Daniel Libeskind, in connection with the construction of the neighbouring Jewish Museum (no. 422), which is joined to the Baroque building below ground level."

Built from 1725 as a farmhouse to Schloss Monbijou, the increase in importance of the trade along the road to Hamburg in the following century was such that the two gabled buildings were joined together in 1827, with the height of the building also raised. 55 years later, the timber-framed front received a neo-Classicist facade of rendered brickwork. Evidence of the continued working character of the building is provided by the central gateway, a feature that (where at all evident) is usually eccentrically designed in more prestigious buildings; as well as the open steps in place of the normal stairway. The garden house was demolished in the post-war period; the front wing and stables continue to house a variety of enterprises to this day."

In the present day commercial district, the vicarages are the sole survivors of the first construction period. The architects are unknown. The ensemble was erected to a unified plan and consisted originally of three buildings, connected at the rear via a courtyard with greenery. The building in Glinkastraße, inhabited by theologian and philosopher Friedrich Schleiermacher from 1809-16, was destroyed in the Second World War."

It was also the first building of significance erected by Friedrich 11 and the starting point for the Forum Fridericianum (no. 32). The oldest opera house in the country, it has been converted and augmented on numerous occasions. The original appearance was the main facade alone, created by Knobelsdorff in Classicist style. By 1787, Carl Gotthard Langhans had already begun Ihe first reconstruction work in the interior. Follow ing a fire in 1843, the interior w as redesigned by Karl Ferdinand Langhans in late neo-Classicist style, augmented by a fourth tier. In 1926, the building received its first drawing floor. Following the Second World War, the building received a new form both interior and exterior, along historic lines. The work was completed between 1952 and 1955 to plans by Richard Paulick, and inxolved reconstruction of the drawing floor and side extensions in keeping with the historic facade of Knobelsdorff, auditorium and Apollo room received a completely new appearance, follow ing the example of the Frederician Rococo. Cloakrooms and interval rooms were moved to the basement. In the vicinity, Paulick also constructed a new administration building in the sty le of Knobelsdorff s architecture (no. 280).

The rendered building was probably designed by Knobelsdorff and rests upon a cuboid cellar level, with the three central axes accentuated by Corinthian colossal pillars. In 1822, a two-storey extension was added, together with a courtyard wing. The interior boasts an elegant stairway with wrought iron Rococo banisters. Today, the building is home to the Max-Planck Library and serves as the scientific meeting point of the Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft."

The three freestanding facades lend it a dominant position within the quarter. The facades were redesigned around 1800 in early neo-Classicist form, with broad frieze and foliage bordering as window overhangs. The first floor includes a distinctive bay window. The extensive Knoblauch family lived here for the best part of 170 years, the most famous member of the family being the architect Eduard Knoblauch (1801-65). Amongst other buildings, he constructed the synagogue in Oranienburger Straiie. Today, the former living area with its sumptuous interior is part of the Stadtmuseum."

In 1985, in conjunction with the rebuilding of the Nikolaiviertel (no. 362), work began on the reconstruction of the Ephraimpalais - although a few yards away from the original location. This project included the return of components of the building stored in the western part of the city. The original building was erected by Friedrich Wilhelm Diterichs for the court jeweller and minter Veitel Heine Ephraim. In 1892, Hermann Blankenstein extended the house by three axes on the Muhlendamm. Noteworthy details are the intricate wrought iron balcony railings and the groups of putti. Behind the rounded corners of the building are oval festival rooms, and behind them the oval stairway. One of these rooms had a Baroque ceiling fitted, originally from the Wartenbergsche Palais and designed by Andreas Schlüter.

Situated on the prominent Forum Fridericianum (no. 32), it was the second building to lie completed, after the Staatsoper (no. 27). Friedrich II provided his own sketches of ideas, modelled along the lines of the Roman Pantheon. The reliefs in the frieze and between the portal columns were added at the end of the 19th century. The church was gutted by fire in 1943. In the reconstruction of 1952, Hans Schwippert replaced the original dome with one made from reinforced concrete, plainer and somewhat lower than the original. The entrance to the crypt was widened with a stairway. The interior is modern in style; the colossal columns were retained, but without the original Corinthian capital. Today, the building is a cathedral of the diocese of Berlin."

It is the first royal Prussian castle to be built in Classical style, taking its cue from Schloss Worlitz, by Erdmannsdorff. In the second half of the 19th century, the building changed ownership on a regular basis. In 1939, Paul Baumgarten senior converted the Schloss into a Reichsgiiste-haus, a guesthouse for the government. In the process, the side entrances were converted into round arched windows, with a new portal replacing them in the central projection. Following damage in the war, the building was reconstructed in 1959 with a more simplified interior as the Berlin office of the Federal President. Only the Ovale Saal of Carl Gotthard Langhans remained in its original condition. Since 1944, the castle is the head office of the Head of State (see no. 415), which today is used only for receptions, however."

The moat was gradually filled in; the bridges disappeared. They were once decorated with colonnades at four points. The Mohrenkolonnaden are the only ones remaining on their original location.

The shape of the building is basically an oval, w ith rectangular structures added on all four sides. The building was heavily damaged in the war and the exterior was reconstructed using engravings as a guide. The interior was lost completely. Today, in its place, each floor consists of a large, open-plan room, which are used for the presentation of an important collection of porcelain.

The gate towards the town of Brandenburg is the sole survivor amongst the original 15 Berlin city gates. When Carl Gotthard Langhans designed a new gate for Pariser Platz, the square was surrounded by two-storey Baroque palaces with mansard roofs. The gate formed a stark contrast to these. The design was a significant one, even when compared to others throughout Europe. With it, Langhans placed the powerful forms of ancient Greece in the Baroque city for the first lime, the inspiration came from the Propylaion on the Athens Acropolis, although Langhans managed to achieve an entirely new creation of his own. The quadriga of Johann Gottfried Schadow crowning the gate was tilted through 180 degrees on a number of occasions, with Napoleon even removing to Paris for a lime. The current quadriga Is a complete cast replica of the original, which no longer exists. The original color of the gate is uncertain.

The Ermelerhaus, built in 1760, presumably by Friedrich Wilhelm Diterichs, originally stood at Breite Straße 11. In 1804, the facade was redesigned in neo-Classicist style; the frieze above the portal contains a reference to the tobacco trading of the owner of the time Neumann. In 1824, the building was purchased by Wilhelm Ermeler, after whom it is named. In 1953, the building was restored (still on the original location) before being relocated to the Märkisches Ufer in the course of the widening of Breite Straße in 1968. Original features in the interior are the gilded wrought iron stairway, the festival room on the first floor and the Rosenzimmer room. There is an internal connection to house no. 12, which originally stood on the other bank. The facade was reconstructed in the style of the era around 1740."
Herrenhaus,Stately Mansion,Neo-Classicism: 1790-1879,1804,Wrangelstraße 2,52.50451,13.427214,Heinrich Gentz,"With its simplified and compact ancient world form, the stately house is one of the few’ well-preserved examples of early neo-Classicist architecture in Berlin. A farmhouse is known to have existed on the site of the former manor since the 18th century. In 1803, Heinrich Gentz took charge of a skeleton building, probably begun by David Gilly, and completed it to his own plans. The two floors are divided by a meander frieze; on the garden side is a central projection with Doric columns. The building received its current name, Wrangelschloßchen, after it was home to General Field Marshall Wrangel, who lived here around 1853. The numerous conversions were reversed in the course of a restoration in 1995, during which interior decoration from the late 19th century was discovered. The effect of the building is restricted by those surrounding it."
Schadowhaus,Schadow House,Neo-Classicism: 1790-1880,1805,Schadowstraße 10,52.5175939,13.3835698,,"The Berlin sculptor Johann Gottfried Schadow had a two-storey neo-Classicist residential house built on this site, the architect of which remains unknown. Following Schadow’s death in 1850, his son added a further floor to the house with side wings. The facade is characterized by block rendering. The reliefs on the ground floor are by Schadow; those on the left depicting the history of art in ancient times, those on the right patrons of the arts from ancient times to the Renaissance. The portrait relief of Schadow on the main floor was created after the death of the sculptor. In the hallway plaster mouldings of Schadow reliefs can be seen. The house is being renovated since 2002 as an artist house and since 2008 it houses the offices of the Bundestag administration."

According to the instructions of Friedrich Wilhelm III, it was originally to have been a Doric temple with block rendering and a sandstone portico. This portico was moved to the Pfaueninsel in 1828, under the supervision of Karl Friedrich Schinkel (no. 44) and faced in polished, grey granite in the same manner as the Mausoleum. Schinkel also designed the first annex to the tomb of Friedrich Wilhelm III, completed in 1840. In 1891, a further extension was made for the sarcophagus of Wilhelm I and his wife."
Neue Wache,New Guard House ,Neo-Classicism: 1790-1882,1818,Unter den Linden 4,52.5178925,13.3955229,Karl Friedrich Schinkel,"The Neue Wache stands at the beginning of a row of neo-Classicist monumental buildings by Schinkel, forming the image of the ""Athens of the Spree"". The structure stands alone between the monumental forms of the Zeughaus (Deutsches Historisches Museum/no. 16) and the Humboldt University. The cubic form, reminiscent of a Roman Castrum, has sandstone vestibule, corner towers, cornice and architrave, with the facade elements behind in brick. In place of the classical triglyph and metope frieze, the columns of the vestibule are decorated with metal Victorias. The Neue Wache was dedicated in 1818 as a “Monument to the Victims of the Anti-Napoleonic Wars”. Over the course of the 20th century, this dedication was reformulated three times. In 1931 Heinrich Tessenow converted the central atrium into a “Memorial to the Fallen of the World War”, enclosing it with the exception of a small fanlight. From 1960, the GDR government used the monument to honour the victims of fascism and militarism. Since 1993, the Neue Wache has honoured a more comprehensive memory as “Central Memorial of the Federal Republic of Germany for the Victims of War and Tyranny*. This formulation is just as controversial as the enlarged sculpture by Käthe Kollwitz placed in its interior, a grieving mother with her dead son."
Kreuzberg-Denkmal,Kreuzberg Memorial,Neo-Classicism: 1790-1883,1821,Viktoriapark,52.4880375,13.3816235,Karl Friedrich Schinkel,"As a young man, Karl Friedrich Schinkel (no. 44) painted architectural visions and designs in a romantically interpreted Gothic style, at the time of the wars of liberation seen as a particularly ""German"" approach. The monument to the wars of liberation against Napoleon is an echo of those romantic projects, it was erected by Schinkel on a raised area to the south of the city at the request of Friedrich Wilhelm III. The memorial, with its similarity to a Gothic tower, stands on a cross-shaped floor plan and is crowned with an iron cross designed by Schinkel. This is the origin of the name Kreuzberg, literally “cross hill"". The classical figure decoration is by the sculptors Rauch, Tieck and Wichmann."
Konzerthaus (ehem.

Schinkel incorporated the six Ionic columns and the foundation of the previous building into the new structure. With great skill, he designed a clearly structured, cubic composition. In the centre is the main building, with a small chamber music hall to the left and administrative rooms to the right. The facades are constructed in a system of two-storey pillars in the shape of a grid with windows between them. Initially they were only rendered, with the sandstone covering added in 1884. Christian Friedrich Tieck designed the sumptuous sculpture decorations. Premieres at the Schauspielhaus included Carl Maria von Weber’s opera “Der Freischütz"", together with legendary performances with Gustaf Gründgens. In the Second World War the building was heavily damaged and gutted by fire. During the GDR era, the building was restored to its original condition externally, with the theatre room in the interior replaced by a large concert hall based upon the historic chamber music hall of Schinkel, although this only possessed a Fifth of the volume. Few visitors recognize the great hall as a contemporary addition. Completed in 2003, the new chamber music hall (Werner-Otto hall), is the former orchestra rehearsal hall - that was freely designed along neo-Classicist lines."

Although Schinkel integrated the old structure into the new, prestigious castle, it continues to be visible. From the southern Renaissance tower, Schinkel developed three further towers, thus establishing a symmetry. The plain elements of the layout, together with the reliefs, are based upon structures from the ancient world, as is the interior, with its numerous statue niches."

Following an 1818 plan, the structure was erected as a new' link between Schloss (no. 7) and Lustgarten (no. 441) on the one side and the boulevard Unter den Linden on the other side. The rhythm of the three stone bridge pillars is accentuated by a pedestal of red granite on the balustrade. Cast iron railings stand in between, with richly ornate sea horses and dolphins. The Carrara marble figures were added after Schinkel’s death, between 1847 and 1857, and were created by sculptors from the school of Christian Daniel Rauch. Young heroes are depicted as a monument to the wars of liberation, accompanied by goddesses of victory."

It was modeled on the Villa Reale del Chiatamone in Naples, where the King had stayed on a visit The structure stands on an almost square floor plan at the eastern end of Schloss Charlottenburg (no. 19), laid out on the Baroque axis system. The rooms are arranged around a central stairway; a gallery on iron trusses surrounds the upper floor. The building was heavily damaged in 1943, with almost all of the furnishings lost. As the building was well documented, it proved possible to rebuild the exterior and interior walls in the years up to 1966, with the pavilion accessible again since 1970. Today, it houses an important art collection from the Schinkel era, and was renovated extensively in 2001."

Ottmer used plans drawn up a number of years previously by Karl Friedrich Schinkel (no. 44), who had failed to receive the commission. Following bomb damage, the interior was modernized in 1952 for the Maxim Gorki Theater. The original facade, with pilasters and doors framed with edicules remains in place to this day."

The area Is first mentioned as ""Thlergarten"" In a deed of 1527. The creation of the Lietzenburger Chaussee In 1698, leading to the Schloss In Charlottenburg (no. 19), was the first route to transect the area. Further routes were to follow, crossing at the GroBer Stern (no. 245). The area has been altered to on many occasions, as well as being opened to the general public, under Friedrich II. The current form is based largely on designs of the prominent landscape architect Peter Joseph Lenné, from the 1830s. Following the bomb damage of the war years and the deforestation in the privation of the post-war years, the replanting since 1949 has been performed In accordance with the plans of Lenné. Most of the historic statues were lost In the war years or replaced by copies at a later dote. Today, the Tiergarten is the largest green area in the city centre. Conducted annually since 1989, the Loveparade was discontinued in 2006 due to considerable damages to the planted areas Incurred from it."

Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm, later King Friedrich Wilhelm IV, decided on the latter version. The building, surrounded closely by other buildings until the Second World War displays a peculiar mixture of cubic towers, and and plane side frontage on the one side and Gothic elements on the other. It Is the first of Schinkel’s buildings to have a facade In roughly hewn bricks. Inside the church, a simple plaster was used for reasons of expense, painted in the form of sandstone blocks In the form of a trompel’oeil. Heavily damaged In the war, the building was reconstructed by the GDR government In the 1980s. This Involved the reversal of later alterations made by Stüler, with the realisation of details by Schinkel that had originally failed to be Implemented. At the same time, the usage of the building was changed, becoming a museum for 19th century sculpture. Significant defects In the reconstruction led to a further restoration after reunification, completed In 2000. in a number of years time, the effect of the historic Werderscher Markt will also be recreated with the dense rebuilding of the adjoining plots, currently standing empty."
Altes Museum,Old Museum,Neo-Classicism: 1790-1892,1830,Am Lustgarten,52.5191213,13.4001665,Karl Friedrich Schinkel,"At the time of its creation, the Altes Museum was the only museum in Germany and only the third museum in all of Europe. The rectangular, two-storey structure with its four wings is connected through a staircase almost 98 feet in width. The stairway is one of the most remarkable of Schinkel’s creations. 18 Ionic columns underscore the monumental nature of the current entrance building to the Museumsinsel (no. 50). The heart of the Altes Museum is the rotunda, some 75 feet in height, in which 20 Corinthian columns support a gallery structure. This design has a parallel with the Pantheon in Rome, which is also lit with zenital lighting and the cupola of which is also decorated with panels. Since 1998, it once again houses the collection of antiquities (Greek collection) with the treasury. Within the scope of the “Museumsinsel masterplan” (no. 50), the outside flight of stairs and the coffered ceiling in the rotunda were restored."
Elisabethkirche,St. Elisabeth Church,Neo-Classicism: 1790-1893,1834,Invalidenstraße 3,52.5331269,13.3972411,Karl Friedrich Schinkel,"This temple-like building was built in combination with three further churches planned by Schinkel for the northern suburbs of Berlin (see no. 64). The Elisabethkirche was gutted by fire in 1945. For decades it was no more than a ruin, until action groups recently successfully lobbied for its restoration. The church is a single-nave, rectangular rendered structure with apse and tympanum, together with a pillared portico, also gabled. Both gables are decorated with acroters. The interior once housed two-storey timber galleries, with a corresponding double row of rectangular windows on the side fronts, with sandstone crossbars. A cast zinc font remains of the original fittings. Based on a private initiative, the church was renovated starting in 1990 and is used for cultural events following its partial completion in 2009."
Nazarethkirche,Nazareth Church,Neo-Classicism: 1790-1894,1835,Leopoldplatz,52.5475193,13.3598859,Karl Friedrich Schinkel,"Schinkel designed four new church buildings (see no. 63) for the northern suburbs that had been created as a consequence of the expansion of the city. The most prominent site, in the centre of a square, was occupied by the Nazarethkirche. Like the other three churches, it is a single nave hall design without tower, with semi-circular apse and galleries. In the design, Schinkel referred back to the Romanesque forms of upper Italy, with three round arch portals and a rosette window decorating the enclosed front of the church. In the 1880s, the church received the addition of an apse, with a suspended ceiling added in 1906, still in place to this day. In 1981, a fundamental restoration was carried out, with the illustrations on the paneled ceiling and walls recreated."
Bauakademie,Academy of Architecture,Neo-Classicism: 1790-1895,1836,Schinkelplatz,52.5165967,13.3983836,Karl Friedrich Schinkel,"[Demolished] Situated in a prominent, central position with numerous visual links, Schinkel's Bauakademie is the most modern of his buildings: a cube Shaped brick building with four equal facades without a central intonation. The eight respective axes formed the Interior pattern of the design from segmented arches, a feature that he had noted on his voyage to England. The function of the sparse decor of violet bricks and beige terracotta stripes was to refine the building, making it appear less bulky. Terracotta tablets beneath the windows depict the history of architecture. The serial construction of the Bauakademie makes it an early forerunner of modern raster structures. The interior of the building was reconstructed on a number of occasions. Following partial destruction in the Second World War, work had begun on its reconstruction. Despite this, the Bauakademie was demolished in 1961 to make way for the new Foreign Ministry of the GDR on Schinkelplatz (see no. 317). There is broad agreement on the reconstruction of the Bauakademie. Since early 2001, the northeast corner of the building has stood on the rebuilt Schinkelplatz, reconstructed by apprentices. The reconstruction of the entire building, most likely as an architecture museum, is planned. Since 2004, the reconstructed design is being presented on a giant scaffolding cover, inside which a sample room has been constructed."

Distinctive features are the high surfaces of the main storey and the richly ornamented mezzanine above it. Frieze-like, small window openings interchange with allegoric figures and coats of arms, with a radiant blue serving to further vitalise the pattern. Two mighty eagles occupy the corners. In 1943, the building was burnt out, with the magnificent interior lost. A side veranda, linking to the rolling form of the library on Bebelplatz, was also lost. In 1963, the front facades were rebuilt, with all rear sections torn down and replaced by a modern building, used by institutes of the Humboldt University. The pergola was reconstructed by October 2007. There is an internal connection to the adjoining building, the reconstruction of a 1721 Baroque house."

The original building was supplemented by a tower-like extension in 1850, with the new sections of the building from 1869 and 1873 adapting to the same style. Following the death of Wilhelmine Amalie Hollmann, her husband established a foundation for the widows and daughters of senior civil servants. During the GDR years, the building was used as a home for senior citizens. Between 2003 and 2006, the entire structure was converted into modern freehold flats and the facades renovated."

Construction was begun in 1840. During the GDR era, the ensemble was in danger of collapse, before being saved With a significant financial contribution from the heritage conservation office and private investors, with a subsequent comprehensive modernisation. In 1989, the Kunsthof Gesellschaft drew up new usage concepts for artistic and creative trades. The courtyard is distinguished from others by its choice of color and cloud-like rendering, a contrast to the clinical appearance assumed by its neighbors following renovation. The Cafe Silberstein took up the tradition of a restaurant of the same name dating from 1910. The courtyard houses galleries and shops."

The district was long characterized by barracks and parade grounds, later also by theaters (see no. 142). The Biedermeier houses of no. 14-17 represent the remnants of a formerly complete row of houses, and were constructed in the course of the development of Friedrich-Wilhelm-Stadt between 1830 and 1840.

One reason for this is the attractive patina of the ochre-coloured rendering. The house is a prime example of the neo-Classicism of Schinkel’s successors in Berlin. The imposing three-winged construction with its side passage gateways forms a courtyard to the street. An eye-catching element is the sturdy central projection with large rounded arch for the main entrance and halls in the first floor. The reserved decor consists of a classical group of figures in the triangular gable, relief busts of renowned veterinarians and acroters on the gables of the side wings."

Stüler designed a brick basilica along the example of early Christian and Italian models. It is framed by two constructions added at a later date, the vicarage and the parsonage. Following destruction in the Second World War, the church was rebuilt in 1957 with a new, simple interior, without galleries. In 1982, Gerhard Spangenberg added two further vicarage buildings at the rear, weaving them sensitively into the existing material and symmetry of the church complex."

Albert Speer wished to tear down parts of the historic quarter as early as the 1930s, in order to erect a section of the “north-south axis” of his Germania plan (see no. 225). The Matthaus-Kirche originally stood at the centre of a rectangular square, the outline of which can still be seen today in the current layout of the streets. It was constructed in Byzantine style with round arched windows and a horizontal brick pattern. The triple nave complex can be seen from the three gables and apses.

The structure was originally a two-story affair, with a mansard roof. In 1857 this was replaced by an additional floor, the facade was redesigned in late Classical style and a pergola was added on the left hand side. Heavily damaged in the Second World War, the ruins were later torn down completely. It was not until 1968 that work began on the external reconstruction, as part of the general reappraisal of Prussian heritage. The reconstruction work was headed by Richard Paulick, who also designed the new room layout of the interior, in neo-Classicist style. In 1990, the Unification Treaty was signed at this location."

The first element of this plan was tho Neues Museum. The centrerpiece was an Imposing stairway, as high as the building Itself, In the centre of the rectangular building, decorated with a cycle of paintings by Kaulbach, depicting the history of mankind. Stüler grouped the rooms of the respective north and south wings around a courtyard. While Stiller maintained an elegant, reserved neo-Classiclsm of the Schinkel school for the exterior, the Interior was lavishly decorated with motifs from the Antiquity. The Neues Museum suffered severe damage in the war, with the northwest wing completely demolished. While the GDR government rebuilt and renovated the other structures on the Museumsinsel, the Neues Museum remained a ruin. In 2001 -200V, the British architect David Chipperfleld reconstructed the building with a unique mix of old and new architectural elements. Earlier controversies concerning the planned glass entrance building to the Museumsinsel broke out again In 2010 as It would cover up the Neues Museum.

The doorway of the rear building is also decorated with noteworthy ornamentation. Originally erected as a hospital for the Jewish community, the complex soon became one of the most modern medical establishments in Germany. After the First World War, a children’s home was added to the rear building.

Following destruction in the war, the house was rebuilt in 1967 as the official seat of the president of the Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz, the Prussian cultural foundation. The plain interior, inspired by classical images, was designed by Nany Wiegand-Hoffmann."

The house was converted and extended in 1863 by v. d. Hude to plans by Bürde. The interior conceals a number of treasures, most significant of which are the twin stairway and a hall on the ground floor, which was added in 1934, possibly originating from Karl Friedrich Schinkel (no. 44). Since 1990, it also houses the Theater im Palais and since 2004 also the “Saarlandische Galerie"" of the state of Saarland."

It was erected in Oriental style as part of the development lining the street and is crowned by an imposing dome, flanked by two smaller cupolas and visible over a significant distance. The grand facade with terracotta on the main portals is divided horizontally by colored bricks. An imposing cast iron stairway is located inside the building. During the “Night of Broken Glass”, the rear of the building, in particular, was heavily damaged, and later demolished. The front of the building was rebuilt in 1988-91 with financial support from the Federal Republic of Germany. The height of the original nave is indicated today by a glazed roof. In 1991, the dome was also reconstructed. Today, the rooms are used by the Jewish community in Berlin. A museum and the dome are open to visitors."

A name that refers to the colour of the bricks, not, as many suspect, to the political circumstances of the GDR era. The new building was erected on the site of the Altes Rathaus in a round arch style based upon that of the Italian early Renaissance, on an almost rectangular floor plan. It has three courtyards and a 318-feet high tower, in the style of Flemish belfries, which, when approached from the west, stands precisely in the axis to the Unter den Linden. The brick structure is decorated with architectural sculpture in sandstone and terracotta.
The balustrade of the main floor balcony boasts a long terracotta frieze, the Steinerne Chronik or stone chronicle, depicting scenes from the history of Berlin from its foundation to the establishment of the Reich in 1871. Behind the main portal, steep steps lead up to the Festsaal, the festival hall. In 1945, the building was heavily damaged by bombs; the interior was partly redesigned during reconstruction.

Adler combined stylistic elements of the Bauakademie and Romanesque churches in Cologne and Italy. From an urban planning viewpoint, the church forms the conclusion of the axis Mariannenplatz - MariannenstraBe. Characteristic features are the highly-visible double tower facade and drum cupola. In the interior of the church, cast iron struts were employed for the first time in church construction. The reconstruction in the years up to 1963 enabled the exterior to be recreated in original form, whereas, inside, the pulpit was moved forward and the side galleries removed."

It was erected here in 1866-73 as a monument to the victorious Franco-German war. At the top of the column stands Viktoria, goddess of victory, by Friedrich Drake, in the Berlin vernacular Goldelse. The shaft of the column is decorated with golden cannon, with martial scenes depicted on the plinth in relief form. In the course of the Germania plans of Hitler’s master builder, Albert Speer (no. 225), the column was moved to the current position on modern-day Straße des 17. Juni. Today, it forms the central point of the Tiergarten, visible from a great distance. The traffic island upon which it stands can be reached using a pedestrian underpass, for the entrance of which Speer designed four Monumental era temples in 1938. A narrow spiral staircase leads up to an observation platform. Until November 2011, the Siegessaule underwent comprehensive renovations, during which the Viktoria was also completely newly covered in gold."

And it is in this style that Stüler’s Nationalgalerie continues to stand majestically on the Museumsinsel. The original plan was for the structure to house an auditorium and lecture rooms for the university. During the construction period, the intended purpose of the building was altered. The collection of contemporary German painting was to be housed there, after having been donated to the state in 1861 by Consul Wagener. As a consequence, the building had to adapted to meet the requirements of an art gallery. To ensure an adequate source of light for the exhibition rooms, the original full columns were amended as semi columns and the north facade was converted into a semicircle. The imposing added open staircase appears to serve the sole purpose of framing the statue of Friedrich Wilhelm IV. It has no true function, as the building is entered through the round arched doorway on the ground floor. The red sandstone building with its temple form stands perched on a 39 feet-high plinth. Between 1911-1913, the order of the rooms in the interior was partially altered by museum director Justi. In the GDR era, the interior of the museum was reconstructed, with a number of alterations. The most recent renovation, by the Stuttgart architect HG Merz, involved the building being fitted (almost invisibly) with the latest technology. The interior, dating from a variety of eras, was not reconstructed in a uniform new style, but augmented carefully in the style of the age. The Alte Nationalgalerie is the first building to have its reconstruction completed in the scope of the master plan of the Museumsinsel from 1992 to 2001. Today, it contains paintings from the era of neo-Classicism to early Modernity."

This became the first public park in the east of Berlin. The park was expanded significantly in the time up to 1876 by the same architect. In 1913, Ludwig Hoffmann (no. 141) created the popular Märchenbrunnen fountain. The travertine neo-Baroque feature was heavily damaged in the war and rebuilt later. The anti-aircraft bunker that stood in the park from the early 1940s was demolished after the war and buried in a larger and smaller mound together with stone rubble from the demolished Berliner Stadtschloss (no. 7).

In 1871. August Orth realised the idea of the ’‘detached central railway stations’’. Eight railway termini for long-distance transport, together with the S-Bahn ring under construction at that time were to be connected with the construction of a north-south tunnel (no. 252) and an east-west embankment. In the historic centre, in particular, the problem emerged as to how the line was to traverse the densely built-up area, without the necessity of demolishing too many buildings. The continental innovation lay in the form of a space-saving viaduct, erected on the filled-in Baroque fortified moat, and whose 757 arches continue to provide the rail company with good rental income to this day. The fact that these structures continue to be the home of workshops, (flea markets, dance halls and exhibition areas makes the S-Bahn an incomparably urban form of transportation."

Franz Schwechten, architect of the Anhaller Bahnhof (no. 95) and the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedachtniskirche (see no. 107), constructed power supply room, magazine, boiler and brewing house, fermenting cellar, cellars, despatch and a public bar in brick. A tower on the corner of Sredzkistraße and Schonhauser Allee makes the complex recognisable from afar. The typical, neo-Romanesque round arched style was an effective marketing ploy: the castle-like appearance signaled a good lager beer.

Following the establishment of the German Reich in 1871, a new parliament building was planned as a symbol of the newfound national unity. However, even the search for a suitable plot proved extremely difficult. A site on the other side of the current Platz der Republik was too far for the parliamentarians, and the site occupied by the Reichstag today was already occupied by a Palais, whose owner was most unwilling to sell. An initial competition in 1872 resulted in no decision being made, the second (only open to German architects) was won by the Frankfurt architect Paul Wallot. Where the other designs were characterised by academic historicism, Wallot employed elements from the Italian High Renaissance and motifs from the ancient world to create a “synthetic Reich style” (Tilmann Buddensieg). With the steel and glass dome, Wallot also indicated a grasp of the contemporary technical options at his disposal. Kaiser Wilhelm II followed the process of construction with a critical eye, and not only because of this dome, which represented competition to the dome of the Schloss. The cube shaped building was considered unfortunately sited, due to having its “back"" to the city centre, and comprised two inner courtyards. The compact corner towers, rising above the building, give it a bulky appearance. The two-storey main front is divided up by column porticos and colossal order with three quarter columns, with the remainder of the facade over three storeys. It was not until 1916 that Peter Behrens' inscription “Dem deutschen Volke”, literally “for the German people”, was added. The Reichstag was heavily damaged in the Second World War, with the dome, which threatened to collapse, later demolished. In the 1960s, the structure was reconstructed by Paul Baumgarten as a building for meetings of parliamentary parties and committees of the German Bundestag, with almost all of the remaining historic interior destroyed and replaced with extremely plain, modern elements. The majority of the rich sculpture work on the exterior was also removed. After the fall of the Wall, there was a new, fundamental reconstruction of the building, including a new dome, by Sir Norman Foster (no. 445). Opposite the rear side of the Reichstag stands the former house of the Reichstag president, dating from 1904 and also erected by Paul Wallot. Today this is the seat of the Parlamentarische Gesellschaft, an association of parliamentarians."

The Gedachtniskirche was built in a Rhenish late Romanesque style as part of a square development, which was also in late Romanesque style - that included the famous Romanisches Cafe - of which nothing remains today. Following heavy damage in the Second World War and partial demolition in the 1950s, today only the mosaics of the entrance hall indicate an impression of the former interior.

It was awarded a prize at the Paris World's Fair of 1900. The Five-storey, U-shaped structure encloses a large courtyard with a four-storey garden house. With this complex, Messel avoided the typically restricted courtyard planning of the time. On the site of the poorly-lit Berliner Zimmer rooms in the corners of the building he placed the stairways. All apartments have closed hallways and indoor toilets. The courtyard served as a children's play area. The facades of the individual buildings are designed in a varied, yet uniform manner. The five shops and two restaurants were initially organised and run by the association. Following their destruction in the Second World War, a few of the houses (often highly simplified) were rebuilt in 1950."

The new bridge built to carry the traffic of the widened GertraudenstraBe means that today the old Gertraudenbrücke is only used by pedestrians. On the northern side stands a bronze statue of St Gertrud with a travelling Journeyman. On the street front of the commercial building, built by Jacob and Roensch, the former route of Gertraudenstraße can still be seen.

Built on the south side of the plot, the Landtag took an almost square, cubic shape, in the form of the Italian High Renaissance. The manor house was later added on the north side, connected to the Landtag. Following reunification the building was converted for use by the Berlin House of Representatives, which had met in Rathaus Schoneberg during the cold-war era of division. This conversion included the restoration of the imposing stair hallway and the redesign of the plenary hall in modern form."

In the mid-1980s it was back again - as a copy. Shortly after this the Lowentor, the lion gate, the other entrance to the zoological gardens on Hardenbergplatz, was also reconstructed, after having also been destroyed in the war. As with the Elefantentor, the design of the 19th century animal houses in the interior of the complex also reflected the country of origin of the animals within. Examples remaining include the antelope house (1872) or the soliped house, with its Persian tower (1910). In 1913, the architects of the two gates also designed the aquarium in Budapester StraBe. In 1929, Franz Hessel posed the interesting question of “whether the Indian elephant is interested in the mosaic dragons decorating the doors of his palace? Does the zebra love its African homestead?"" The Berlin zoological gardens are the oldest in Germany, having been established in 1844."

The idea was such a new one that a suitable term for it did not emerge until 1912. The master builder connected the purchased plots via a private road. The public was kept at bay using a wrought iron gate. In contrast to standard apartment blocks, the 20 or so individual buildings are not arranged in closed groups, but were orientated on an interior space, towards which they displayed the same eclectically ornamented facades as faced the outside. This represented nothing less than the invention of the large garden courtyard, which continues to represent the tower block ideal to this day."

It lies in a district that is typical of the middle class residential housing districts that sprouted up around the turn of the century at such a blistering pace. Within the composed network of streets, six axes gravitate in a star shape towards the square, which is almost oval in form. The semi-circular arcade on the western side of the square corresponds to the U-Bahn entrance on the eastern side. Following a simplification of the square in 1957, the historic image was recreated in 1980, with a central water basin, fountains and areas of lawns and flowerbeds."

Messel designed a three-storey monumental structure for the Berliner Handelsgesellschaft, with colossal columns and pilasters in sandstone on a sturdy rusticated plinth.

The two lower floors are separated from the remainder of the facade through a fascia, above which the apertures develop into either a large display window or a row of three, clover-arched windows. The high proportion of glass in the facade is an idiosyncratic interpretation of the residential and commercial building typology of Alfred Messel, who, a number of years previously, had provided a significant impetus to the contemporary architectural debate with the glazed pillar front of the Wertheim department store on Leipziger Platz. As the building was built on the exact floor plan of its predecessor, today it is one of the narrowest buildings in Friedrichstraße, with a width of just 39 feet."

The building was built in a number of stages from 1872 onwards, largely to plans by Wilhelm Martens. A significant alteration was made in 1950.

Despite this, here Messel developed a new expression of simplicity and clarity, later continued in the structures of Hermann Muthesius. Externally, the plinth dominates, with its rough natural stone; the gables are faced with shingles. The individually designed rooms are grouped freely around a hallway, which can also be seen from the exterior in the form of bay windows, ledges and set-offs.

At the end of the 19th century, the new site was finally developed in Lichterfelde, in the southwest of the city. A number of glasshouses were erected for the more sensitive plants. The most impressive of these is the Grade Tropenhaus or large tropical house, with a surface area of 1,937 square feet and a ridge height of 82 feet. The angle of the steel girders, beginning above a plinth height of around 16 feet, gives the building the impression of a single, mighty glass roof of monumental elegance."

The street front is elongated in form, with the ends falling lower to both sides, decorated lavishly with groups of figures, with the Terrace guarded by two liens. As with other hundred site structures, the rear side of the building is completely without decoration.

The wing in Grunerstraße was demolished in 1968 in order to broaden the street. The remaining tracts were reconstructed in simplified form following heavy damage in the Second World War.

The reason is that the two brave Atlas figures on both sides of the portal appear to be struggling to maintain their grip on the overloaded facade of misconstrued southern German Baroque and Art Nouveau. They already hang much too low above the pavement. Where formerly a coat of arms of the ruler was sufficient, the central projection of this building has no less than three cartouches for the builder of this “ghost house”. It becomes immediately apparent why the late Historicism era was subjected to so much contemporary criticism."

With its rolling facade and cupola, the building is a dramatic presence on the northern tip of the Museumsinsel (no. 50). Built on a triangular floor plan, it encloses five courtyards. The sandstone facades are concisely divided by a Corinthian colossal order and gabled projections. At the main entrance, open arcades lead into an atrium, connecting the splendid dome hall with gallery and symmetrical open stairways. At the centre stands a copy of the statue of the Great Elector by Andreas Schluter (no. 18). The central connecting axis continues into the so-called basilica, designed in the manner of a Florentine Renaissance church, and the smaller stairway (also domed) at the other end of the museum.

However, in contrast to Ludwig Hoffmann with his museum, Alfred Messel distanced himself from the historicising style of the age. With no plinth, the brick-faced colossal pilasters begin almost at pavement level, and the absence of a classical framework enables them to stretch up to the eaves. The windows in between appear to have been hung in place. The main entrance and gable area serve to highlight the central axis of the building, the limestone decorative elements of which are based on the Baroque. The original tower cover was lost.

The barrel-vaulted hall on the ground floor, clad with marble, housed vending machines for food and drink - an extremely modern facility in the early years of the 20th century. In contrast to this somewhat progressive usage, Schmitz turned to figurative motifs for the design of the facade, aspects that he had already applied to numerous monuments in his capacity as a leading proponent of German Historicism. Consequently, the porches of the three display windows on the ground floor are supported by three naked figures and accentuated in the middle by a stylised man's head. The ornamental sculpture work, largely the work of the Breslau stonemason Christian Behrens, lends an animated air to the exterior of the building."

With its dimensions, it destroyed the existing balance between the Stadtschloss (no. 7), Altes Museum (no. 62) opposite and the Classical cathedral in between. The latter, a church building converted by Schinkel (no. 44), was demolished to create room for the Berliner Dom, which the Kaiser intended to become the foremost church in the Protestant world. The mighty church of the Hohenzollern was both court church and place of burial, it takes its style from Roman Baroque. It is held to be the most significant ecclesiastical structure from the late Gründerzeit era in Germany. On the south side stands the church for christenings and weddings, with the memorial church that completed the complex to the north demolished in 1976. An unusual feature is the former Imperial stairway, which would look more al home in a palace. Repair of the heavy damage of the Second World War was completed on the exterior in 1981 and most of the interior by 1993. This involved a simplification of the central cupola on the cordon, which was rebuilt lower than the original. The four flanking cupolas are also plainer. Since 1999, the restored Hohenzollern vault with 90 sarcophaguses of members of the House of Hohenzollern was reopened to the public. After restoration of the cupola mosaics in 2002, the cross of cupolas was renewed from 2006-08."

Messel retained the already developed system of end-to-end pillars, leading up to the roof from a minimal plinth and with the Intermediate space fully glazed. The ground floor area consisted of a four-trestled hall with arcades and solid vaulting. A bonnet-like mansard roof completed the building. The structural decoration played second fiddle to the monumental effect of the soaring columned facade. Despite a degree of contemporary criticism, this ""department store gothic” style of Messel remained a dominant feature of Berlin department store architecture until the First World War. The enormous department store complex was gutted by fire, in the Second World War, although the facades in Leipziger Struße and on Leipziger Platz remained. They were demolished to provide a clean line for the division between East and West Berlin. After the fall of the Wall, the Italian architect Aldo Rossi designed a new structure for the plot which was never implemented. The lawsuit of the Wertheim heirs with KarstadtQuelle AG (2005-07) ended with the retransfer of the plot to the heirs. In December 2006, the premises were sold to the Oreo real estate group."

Of the original building of the Deutsches Theater dating from 1850 only the two-tiered auditorium by Eduard Titz remains. In 1883, the remainder of the building was redesigned in Renaissance style, including the facade. In 1906, Max Reinhardt, who led the theatre to worldwide acclaim, commissioned William Muller with the addition of a revolving stage* and the reworking of the fade in Monumental era style. The same architect also converted the adjacent casino Into a chamber music hall.

The original building of 1907 was erected as a five-storey brickwork structure in the residential area of the Neuer Westen. Schaudt adapted his design to the area by rejecting a columned facade in favour of a closed facade with individual windows. A courtyard was not included in the design. Schaudt himself converted the building in 1930 for the first time, with, amongst other features, the addition of a further two storeys. Reconstruction in 1950 saw the hipped roof replaced by a flat roof. In the 1960s and 1970s, the building was subjected to further conversion work.

The Hackesche Höfe were constructed for mixed usage, with commercial space, amusement areas and festivity rooms, generously-appointed apartments in the front building, craft workshops, shops and workers’ apartments in the courtyards to the rear. The architectural styles were also varied, ranging from rendering, white fascia stones and ornate, lazed tiling on the front of the courtyards, with styles varying between Art Nouveau and Art Deco. After reunification, the building, which had deteriorated during the GDR era, was initially rediscovered by-artists. Soon after, the entire complex was acquired by a private investor. It was comprehensively restored in a tenant-friendly manner, with new shops, restaurants, theatre and cinemas moving in. The Hackesche Höfe rapidly developed into a core feature of the pulsating life of the Spandau periphery.

This prestigious street rapidly developed into the most expensive residential real estate in Berlin. The plots, the value of which increased three thousand-fold in the years up to the turn of the century, became the sites of a tight concentration of stately tenement houses in every conceivable style. They often occupied 80 percent of the plots, reaching construction depths of 66 feet. At that time, the buildings were also inhabited on the ground floor, which can still be seen today in the display windows at parapet height between Wielandstraße and LeibnizstraBe. The apartments were enormous (in the building of Kurfürstendamm 60 for example, there were apartments with 4,400 and 6,200 square feet), with domestic staff entering via their own stairways, the narrow spirals of which appear to have been stuck to the courtyard facade as an afterthought. The layout of rooms was in accordance with the social mores of the age, with reception room, salons, closets and bedrooms, a layout that led to many of these apartments - often subdivided -finding use as lawyer's offices or medical surgeries after the war."

The picturesque complex is grouped around two courtyards and displays references to various styles and structures. This also involved the integration of original historical components. The high, rectangular brick tower is similar to the keep of the Bischofsburg castle in Wittstock, the main section is a copy of a Gothic brick church.

From 1928 onward, the building served the AEG company as a technology building. A cinema and artistes’ school moved into the bomb-damaged building after 1945. In the early 1980s, approval was given for the ruins to be demolished. The occupation of the building by the Tacheles artists’ association after reunification and the brightly painted walls raised awareness of the ruins beyond Berlin.

Despite the narrow front, the facade succeeds in making a monumental impression with a concise cubature and sturdy rusticated blocks, reaching up to the fifth floor. The most significant accent comes from the high wall alcove, from which a window area extends outwards in an arch. The ticket office area is equipped with mahogany panelling with boxwood inlay. The theatre area itself is furnished with dark woods and silk drapes; laid out on two levels, it has a very intimate character. After the war, the upper level was altered.

The site is almost triangular in shape and is connected via a sweeping private road. Courtyards to the surrounding streets and the narrow width of the houses ensure adequate illumination for the apartments. The house entrances standout with decorated, shaped block work and reliefs. With this exception, there is an absence of structural decoration. With this complex, Mebes overcame the Historicism of the Grunderzeit era, developing floor plans and facades based more upon function."

Peter Behrens, appointed AEG in-house architect shortly before, created a 394-feet long, unsupported hall and elevated the construction. visible in the side facade, to the dominant design element. The aesthetic presentation of the triple-jointed steel frame construction, emerging visibly from the facade at pedestrian height, underlines the dawning of a new era, in which industrial architecture was to witness a revaluation: from the design of simple workshops to the shop floors of the machine age. On the longitudinal side of the hall, the areas between the iron supports are completely glazed. The proportions of the building and its monumental appearance are analogous to those of ancient temples, with the consequence that this Behrens structure is also recorded in architectural history as ‘temple of labour*."

The monumental complex comprises three wings and is built in Monumental era style, influenced by Greek designs. It opens toward the direction of the Kupfergraben. There, the side wings are concluded by two temple fronts, equipped with relatively steep triangular gables. The structure is faced with limestone and rendering. Following disruptions in disruptions in its, the building was not opened until 1930. In the GDR era, a new entrance and a bridge to the forecourt were added.

The most splendid of all was the station Stadtpark (today's underground railway station Rathaus Schoneberg) which was built in 1909. The underground railway, which ran underground to this point, came to the surface here in a design by the architect Johann Emil Schaudt, who also erected the KaDeWe (no. 143). He designed the station as a bridge between the two, higher-lying districts to either side, as well as between park and town. He connected innsbrucker Straße to a play area using an open stairway, using the soil excavated in the tunnel building process to sculpt a valley landscape, filling the accumulating groundwater into a reservoir."

Windows are almost at room height, with small French window style decorative step-out areas with finely woven balcony mesh. Medallions between the windows of the first floor symbolise different towns and cities of the Baltic coast. The interior and the ground floor, which formerly housed shops, were altered in the GDR era. In the course of the conversion into a home for the elderly, the building was reconstructed after reunification, with the facade renovated.

The aim of this was to control the development of the rapidly expanding city, upgrade problem districts, create more green spaces and improve transport connections. The prestige of the metropolis was also to be reflected in its urban planning. The number of inhabitants was estimated at five million. The 27 drafts submitted were directed predominantly towards the redesign of Potsdamer Platz and Leipziger Platz. Martin Machler’s design for a north south axis was blown up Into gigantic proportions by Albert Speer in the 1930s (see no. 225).

With this in mind, construction counsellor Ludwig Hoffmann (no. 141) erected this administrative structure, spread over four courtyards, with a “hall for large public festivals, which the city had previously lacked” (Fritz Stahl, 1914). The characteristic symbol of the building was a 260-feet tower with a cupola that at the time was the highest in the city, based upon the cathedral on Gendarmenmarkt (no. 13). The barrel-vaulted crypt was decorated with aphorisms and a bronze bear by Georg Wryba. The decoration was in Roman style, in order to underscore the claim to permanence of the young metropolis. After the war, the GDR government used the Stadthaus for the Council of Ministers, turning the building into a fortress. Starting in 1996, the building was restored under Gerhard Spangenberg.

Following the First World War, the building was acquired by the Hugennberg-Verlag publishers, the Jewish shop owners had their property expropriated. In 1938, the company received permission to double the length of the Zollernhof by building over the Kleine Kirchgasse. Six additional window axes were added in the form of the original building. The seven large figures on the cornice were moved Into the centre. Almost all the interior was lost in the Second World War. Following reconstruction, the building housed the headquarters of the Freie Deutschen Jugend youth organisation - the central cornice figure was replaced by the FDJ emblem, with the consequence that the spot remains empty to this day.

The small plot between Alte Potsdamer Straße and Linkstraße means that it has two street fronts. It is a typical example of Berlin commercial architecture at the beginning of the century. Two plinth level floors are linked by round arches and followed by three vertically structured main storeys. The facade on Alte Potsdamer Straße juts out from the building and is highlighted by a small tower. The construction work carried out on the new' Potsdamer Platz required that Weinhaus Huth be propped up using complex technology. The architects of the adjoining new buildings consciously incorporated gaps to the old structure. The contrast between the elegant limestone facade of Weinhaus Huth and the industrial aestheticism of Richard Rogers’ building could not be greater.

The Cathedrals of Work,_,Historicism: 1871-1918,_,Huttenstraße 12-19,52.528196,13.32383,_,"The first industrial companies in Berlin emerged at the Beginning of the 19th century to the north of the Oranienburger Tor, along Chausseestraße. The district was known as ""Fireland"", due to the furnaces and smoking chimneys. One of the first large factories to be established here was the Maschinenbauanstalt August Borsig, an engineering company, founded in 1837. The development of the electrical industry in Berlin was even more dynamic. In 1837 the company Siemens & Halske began production in Kreuzberg. The M. Weber plant in Chausseestraße was also to later play a significant role in the development of electrical engineering: in 1867 it was purchased by Emil Rathenau and later renamed “Allgemeine Elektricitats-Gesellschaft” (AEG).
By the 1860s, the new residential districts were already clustering tightly around the production workshops. There were few possibilities to expand the sites in their original locations. Consequently, with the growth of the industry the companies often moved to the peripheral areas of the city. A cluster of industry grew up in Wedding, to the north, with the AEG plant, and later on the upper Spree in Schoneweide. The Borsig plants moved to Tegel, Siemens & Halske, while Loewe moved to Spandau, later also expanding down the Spree in Oberschoneweide.
A key figure in the development of industrial architecture as an independent form was the entrepreneur Emil Rathenau. The design of the new factory in AckerstraBe (see no. 110) was not entrusted to the company's own architects, but handed to Franz Schwrechten, one of the best-known architects of the time. In 1907, he not only entrusted the less well-known architect Peter Behrens with the AEG structure, but also with the design of important product lines and even the company stationary - an unparalleled position, and the harbinger of what was later to become known as Corporate Design. Two years later, Behrens erected his first factory building, the groundbreaking AEG turbine hall in Moabit (no. 151).
In his industrial buildings, Behrens sought to combine ""serial opportunities of neo-Classicist form with the industrial requirements of standardisation"". The principle of arrangement in colossal order is seen most clearly in the front of the small-power motor factory in Voltastraße, where a column front was repeated over four sections between 1910-13, taking its form from Schinkel's Altes Museum (no. 62). The tectonic assembly of the facade was accentuated by Behrens by cladding the steel joists with clinker stone. Large window surfaces enabled copious amounts of light to enter the shop floors. This procedure was adopted by Alfred Grenander in his industrial administration buildings, such as the Loewe armaments factory in Moabit or the Knorr brakes plant in Friedrichshain. The melting together of Classical forms with new steel and glass construction techniques led to the creation of the new “cathedrals of work"".
The industrial complexes of the Gründerzeit era and early Modern age continue to characterise many districts of Berlin to this day. After reunification, their powerful architecture and the open, flexible floor plans made them particular attractive real estate for companies in the fields of the New Economy, design and modern services.
At the birthplace of Berlin industry, north of the Oranienburger Tor, stands a unique administrative building of the Borsig company, erected in 1899: ChausseestraBe 13. In a partially preserved former locomotive factory between Chausseestraße and Novalisstraße, many young companies from the media and advertising sectors have it made their home."

However, the continuation of the line as an elevated railway was hindered by influential Pankow inhabitants, which is why it disappears back below the surface shortly afterwards. The elevated railway viaduct that was required was designed by Grenander, with the structure incorporating two stations. It remains unchanged to this day. Grenander managed to lend the bare, riveted arches a form of high aesthetic quality. The station halls have an equally functional design."

As it soon became a junction point for two lines, the station building was to be a prestigious structure. With his concise, neo-Classlical design on a cross shaped floor plan, Grenander incorporated forms from the era around 1800. The facades are clad with limestone slabs.

The architecture of the building is therefore all the more a warning from the past. In the direction of Reichpietschufer, the building is laid out symmetrically, with a prestigious limestone front. The core of the building in the southern Tiergarten district was used as the Reichsmarineamt in the time of the Kaiser. Beginning in 1938, Krupp and Druckenmüller extended the then Reichsmarineamt with the addition of an administrative section on what is now StauffenbergstraBe. The name of this street is a reminder that this was the headquarters for the resistance movement of 20th July 1944 (today Gedenkstätte Deutscher Widerstand, a memorial to the German resistance. The two components of the building have long since grown together, and are known today as the “Bendlerblock"". Following the destruction of the Second World War, the (expansive building on the Landwehrkanal stood in complete Isolation.

Gebaude des ADGB,Buildings of the General German Confederation of Trade Unions,Early Modernism: 1918-1933,1923,Wallstraße 61-65,Mitte,Wallstraße 61-65 Mitte ,"Max Taut, Franz Hoffmann","Max Taut and Franz Hoffmann built the first house with a facade made of a reinforced concrete frames within the giant complex, which the General German Confederation of Trade Unions had built on Wallstraße. The exterior is accordingly characterised by a strictly rectangular grid. The fields between this space lattice with double windows were lined with bricks, plastered and ultimately painted in different colours. This makes the supporting and non-supporting structural components effectively stand out from one another. While the construction did not leave any more doubt that the rationalism of industrial standardisation would determine how buildings were constructed in the future, a great love of expressionistic artistic work emerged in the interior architecture. The impressive meeting room has been preserved on the side of the building facing Inselstraße to this day."
Mosse-Haus,Mosse House,Early Modernism: 1918-1933,1923,Jerusalemer Straße 46-47,Mitte,Jerusalemer Straße 46-47 Mitte ,Erich Mendelsohn,"This building is a manifest of the optimism of the early Weimar Republic. An explosion during the November revolution in 1919 blew out a corner of the early modernist monumental building by Cremer & Wolffenstein (1901-13). Mendelsohn transferred the tempo of the road traffic into the architecture with a lively new transverse module, emphasised effectively by the ribbon windows, which are covered with black ceramics and that fan out like wings. This makes the building take on a completely new external appearance. The cambered facia construction intensified this dynamic impression and may also be understood as the articulation of the citizen’s self-consciousness at the dawn of Germany’s first democracy."
Borsigturm,Borsig Tower,Early Modernism: 1918-1933,1924,Berliner Straße 35,Reinickendorf,Berliner Straße 35 Reinickendorf ,Eugen Schmohl,"The nervous desire to move of the 1920s usually found expression in horizontal structures in architectural terms. This was not the case with Borsig. The largest German locomotive manufacturer underlined his economic power with a symbolic gesture. The Borsigturm, measuring 213 feet, was the first high-rise building in Berlin. The clinkered steel skeleton construction made it possible to partition each storey into six equal-sized offices or one open-plan office. The expressionist, zigzagged structure with neo-Gothic ribbon windows stands in stark contrast to this rationalism. The construction, which was renovated between 1977-79, is now a landmark of a new city quarter (see Hallen at the Borsigturm, no. 433)."

The building characterises the street scene through its facade with expressionist decoration. The radiance of the house can be compared to the Chile-Haus in Hamburg. Despite all the modern allusions to the “nautical architecture"" of those years (see no. 281) the house continued to follow the classical citizen's city tradition, primarily due to its inner courtyards."
Haus »Dr. Sternefeld«,"“Dr. Sternefeld"" House",Early Modernism: 1918-1933,1924,Heerstraße 107,Charlottenburg,Heerstraße 107 Charlottenburg ,Erich Mendelsohn,"Dynamism is the formal trademark for the optimism of the democratic avant-garde in the Weimar Republic. And it did not just find expression in the large representative buildings, but also in privately owned buildings. The residential building of the doctor Walter Sternefeld is an example of this. In the case of this building made of stacked cubes, the movement develops through forwards and backwards jumps, terraces that extend outwards and ribbon windows that are deeply indented and surround the building. While it is sealed in a fortified manner facing Heerstraße, the L-shaped construction on the side of the house facing towards the Grunewald city forest is all the more informal by way of a contrast. In terms of its facade structure, the residential house is reminiscent of the country houses of the influential American pioneer of the modern period, Frank Lloyd Wright. The mansion originally served the owner as his private house and doctor’s surgery. The treatment rooms were separated from the living quarters by a supporting iron wall. They were located in the rear section of the house. The attic that was sealed outwardly was illuminated through a small inner courtyard and originally served as a storage and a drying room."

It was also correspondingly controversial upon its completion, particular in view of the fact that Gutkind was a product of the contemporary style schools. The dark clinkered facades with white plaster bands and extremely small window's anticipated the new objectivity. The cellar substitute rooms situated in the uppermost storey as well as the reinforced attics, were meant to accommodate a leisure time area (which was not realised) on the roof, assumed the aesthetics of industrial buildings. Set against this, the corner designs (in particular between Eschengraben and Talstraße, where the protruding concrete arch accommodates a filigree glass wall) correspond to the composition principles of expressionism. Such city-like aesthetics were never to form part of the estate construction again."

When viewed from the ground floor, the two rows of six houses structured symmetrically behind one another are an early example of residential construction in the period of new objectivity. While the houses were constructed in a traditional manner in the First construction phase, the houses of the following two construction phases in 1927 and 1928 were already built adopting a steel skeleton design. At the same time, the complex is a chronicle of architecture at whose end are white cubes with glass brick porches. Even low earners were supposed to be able to fulfill the dream of a “mansion in the green areas” through this economical form of building."

A kind of Eiffel tower en miniature was created in the form of the Funkturm, which is 500 feet high and was built on the occasion of the 1st Great German Radio Exhibition in 1924. The Funkturm was opened in 1926 when Albert Einstein delivered the opening address on the occasion of the 3rd Radio Exhibition. The steel construction with a restaurant and a lookout platform served as the radio mast of the Deutscher Hörfunk, founded in Berlin in 1923, which broadcast its programmes from the Haus des Rundfunks (no. 209) opposite it from 1929 onwards. The Funkturm has been a listed building since 1966. The Deutsches Rundfunk-museum, the German Radio Museum, has been located at its feet since 1967."

The large-scale Klingenberg power plant exceeded everything previous to it in order to meet the insatiable electricity demand of the metropolis. The core of the plant was formed by two boiler houses with eight metal smokestacks, a turbine room together with the eleven-storey high-rise building with administrative and social rooms. Apart from the boiler houses, the bare steel construction of the remaining buildings was clad in a cloak made of red clinkered bricks and vertically structured with pillars structured in close succession. The large-scale power plant is one of the outstanding performances in the field of industrial construction."

And the architect who had already assisted the locomotive baron Borsig to achieve cathedral-like selfrepresentation through a tower, now did the same for one of the largest publishing houses in Europe by building a printing house. The eight-storey Ulltslein-Haus, the tower of which surpasses Borslg’s tower by some 40 feet, was Berlin's first high-rise building to be made of concrete. However, this technical novelty was concealed by a red brick facade with elaborate stone masonry work. The highpoint of the plastic decoration is the Ullstein owl."

Its architect fulfilled the same role for this type of transport as Alfred Grenader (no. 213) had done for the underground. But while one architect created a purely functional design, the younger architect Kramer was much more fanciful: parallel arches, jagged oriels (upper-storey bay with a window, supported by brackets or on corbels) and triangular windows converted the tram depot into an example of expressionism, which only found its counterpart in Richard Ermisch’s parallel housing project in Spandau Zeppelinstraße. The work praises the general principle, which was only given up in the post-war period, of viewing transportation constructions as urban elements. Even the hall that is more than 12 hectares in size within the depths of the plot of land reveals gable and balcony facades. Garden terraces and block edges with 380 apartments make the tram town at Müllerstraße an almost normal address. It was converted for buses running in 1958/1960 in parallel with West Berlin’s decision to dispense with the use of trams."
Hufeisensiedlung,Horseshoe Development,Early Modernism: 1918-1933,1927,Hufeisensiedlung,Neukolln,Hufeisensiedlung Neukolln ,"Bruno Taut, Martin Wagner","The joint project of Taut and Wagner is viewed as being the first major German housing estate with more than one thousand residences, of which no less than 480 were detached houses. The housing estate was intended for workers. It was therefore supposed to be an example of standardised construction and large-scale production techniques, with the objective of keeping the construction costs (and consequently the rent prices) low. For instance, the excavation of earth and transportation were mechanised. The workers were nevertheless still unable to afford the houses. Salaried employees and civil servants moved into the houses instead. The core of the estate is formed by the white-plastered “Hufeisen”, a horse-shoe which bends around a flat depression. This extensive “line” is formed from just one type of house, as the serial production required simple and cheap forms, that adapted as well as possible to the lie of the land and involved little earth excavation. The garden design is based on one of Leberecht Migge’s drafts. The Britzer piece de resistance of the construction of workers’ housing is delineated from a romantic, neighbouring housing estate of the Beamtenbauverein, the civil servants’ construction association, through a “red front” comprising 32 identical residential buildings. Taut made intensive use of colour as a design element in addition to brick elements to structure the body shell. The formulation of road spaces and residential streets in the Hufeisensiedlung is deemed as being limited from a contemporary point of view due to rationalisation considerations, but was viewed as being a sign of progress at the time."

The ten-storey longitudinal structure was the first high-rise factory building in Europe. On both sides, the pane, which is a brick nogged, clinker brick-faced steel skeleton, is held in place by defiant stairway towers. These provide access to the continuous production storeys. The high-rise building is a rational construction that was specifically built with the goal of creating the “best and most expedient frame for working purposes” (Hertlein). To this end, the architect departed from perimeter block development and avoided the use of representative decoration."

The step-down station is one of the numerous works, through which Bewag’s in-house architect in the “Electropolis of Berlin"" (Paul Kahlfeldt) created their sacred power generating buildings until 1930. Elements such as the stepped roofs from the side perspective or the powerful flank towers at the front of the central element of the building as well as the towers of the elevated distribution hall all have a sublime quality in terms of their expressionists convergence with the brick Gothic style. It harboured the most sacred thing, technology, in its interior, which was necessary to convert heavy current into standard household electricity."

It belongs to the first generation of new building in the area of council housing. The 88 apartments, ranging from one to three rooms and 592 to 807 square feet in size, are located behind a facade, which apart from a row of clinkered brick and the panel windows with balconies and loggias (a gallery or room with one or more open sides, especially one that forms part of a house and has one side open to the garden), makes the functionality and the comfort of the apartments visible to passers-by. The fixtures and fittings of all the apartments with a bathroom and a kitchen-cum-living room represented a great leap forward for that time. The three-storey U-shaped complex was Mies van der Rohe’s contribution to “accommodation for people on the breadline”."

Self-illuminating structures are also added to it- the highlight is a light chamber, 100 feet in height. The narrow bronze-set strips of light made of opaque glass, which are set in a tight sequence, run horizontally like all corner elements, so that colossal pilasters vertically break down the fronts. While the exterior of the cinema has been preserved as a monument to this day, the interior was completely transformed in 1953 and also in 1969 and 1999. The Titania-Palast was once more partially used as a cinema with seven screens since the conversion in 1995. This included the addition of several suspended ceilings for use as offices."

This is because the step down station is located right in the middle of the perimeter block development of historical Friedrichstadt. The relations to the perimeter block development can barely be identified now due to the war. There are also only ruins remaining of the accumulator factory. Nevertheless, the entire complex is imposing. The smaller, northern section of the factory still reveals remains of the second block power station built in Berlin and has a similar significance in terms of the history of the city and technological history, in the southern section the positioning of the control room is particularly impressive. The steel construction stands in the corner like a wasp’s nest, where its brick filling is reminiscent of classical half-timbering."

These plants were standardised accordingly. However, the building supervision authorities demanded a functional building, which should blend in with the surroundings of the free-standing houses. Müller constructed a facade with triangular oriels. The transformer ventilation was installed in shafts in this construction. He succeeded in both reducing the cascading projection of the oriel consoles and the brick moulding formation in such a way that the two-storey building blends in with the environment. The construction is reminiscent of the relic of a medieval fortification system."

At the same time, they set a new trend in the language of architecture. This is because the cubic steel skeleton constructions no longer express a sense of dynamism due to their decorative facades. This is expressed Instead from their body shells. In addition to the sliding strip windows, the stylish terraces also ensure that the mansions blend In with the gentle-slope like two landscape sculptures. Even the Interior is broken down in a functional manner and yet simultaneously In motion. The living room that consists of a large “flowing room” blends in so to speak with the garden. The two mansions have Infiuenced the residential buildings on Schorlemerallee (no. 181) as their prototypes."

The classrooms had a glass wall that could be folded away into the floor so that it was also possible to teach in an external room that was roofed over. Surrounding ceiling lights and a broad strip of windows completely illuminate the room and, thus, permit the pupils a free seating order, making it possible for them to work in small groups. In addition, the steel concrete building is equipped with maps and projection surfaces that can be moved mechanically. The architecture was therefore designed to do away with the hierarchical teaching of children from the front. The school reform project failed due to the lack of support from politicians and the world economic crisis. It remained a trial construction, which has subsequently been renovated and has been used by an upper school, the Carl-Legien-Oberschule since April 2001."

The single and double rooms are tailor-made to the needs of a clientele that has to spend a lot of time working in their individual professions. Even the very expensive fixtures and fittings were delivered at the same time. The fact that the apartments still offer an astonishing amount of space is due to the rationally considered room conception by Jacobowitz. Scharoun, who made his debut in the residential building with this house, was only allowed to design the backdrop. The facade has been broken down with exit windows and staggered stairway windows. Some of the studios on the attic floor in the new five-storey building are equipped with roof gardens. A sun terrace, accessible to everyone, is located above it."

It is the result of the awful “pulling and tugging"" of 1920s concerning which house roofing was appropriate for the German building culture, which peaked in the so-called “Zehlendorf roof war”. The 120 mostly four to six room apartments of a maximum of 1,890 square feet in size in the detached houses and apartment block buildings are located behind a facade of panel windows with folding window shutters, wooden pergolas and wooden trellises.

In this case, the 4-hectare, deep-laid high performance lawn formed the centre court. Playgrounds and tennis courts, a sports arena, a dance plaza, a horse-shoe shaped ridge with a toboggan run, lush meadows for relaxing and the first permanent colony in Germany were situated around this lawn. Set against these large scale uses, pure garden art can only seldom be found there. But still: An avenue of maple trees, a circle of poplars, a square of chestnut trees and the ponds are real gems."

The seven-storey steel skeleton building formed a schematisation of the 'department store Gothic” style, developed by Alfred Messel as a reaction to the contemporary functionalism. The twin towers of this cathedral of consumption with illuminated advertising columns have convenient devices to keep visitors mobile in the form of fifty customer lifts and underground train connections in addition to a roof garden with a restaurant. The reconstruction after 1945 has not returned the building's former sublimity. Up to the year 2000, the entire design was altered by architects Helmut Kriegbaum, Jurgen Sawade and Udo Landgraf."

While it had once been used to celebrate hygiene, it now served as an exhibition of the body cult. The largest swimming pool of its time followed the bathing, massage and medical wings. The conservative modernist, Tessenow, surrounded the first competition-suitable 160-feet swimming pool with a glass case. Through the double walled beam to joint design as well as the facetted panes, swimmers have the feeling that they are still in the middle of the third element, even when they are above the water line. In this case, the elegantly cool interior does not pay homage to the fun factor of water in a way that the baths of the 80s were to dominate (see no. 364).

Richard Ermisch positioned a two-storey promenade, 1,750 feet in length and 20 feet wide with shops and restaurants between the Grünewald slopes and the shorelines which were increased to a width of 262 feet. The steel skeleton construction that had been brick nogged with yellow clay bricks was expected to combine the “civilised and cultural needs of people from the city with their old-established perceptions of nature” (Martin Wagner). 1.3 million people visited the outdoor swimming area in the first season alone. 30,000 sun worshippers flock here on hot summer days.

He designed more than 70 stations, viaducts and service buildings between 1899 and 1931, which (like a constructed chronicle) tell the story of the change in history through to an abstract objectivity from the 1920s onwards. A few expedient elements have leant the stations of the U8 line a simple, but also deceptive calm. This is because the constant sequence of rows of columns, ceiling lights and station signs in all the stations, which differ in colour from one another, are set in motion when the train moves. Brakes and acceleration, i.e. speed, can be visually perceived as a technical journey through time."

Subsequently, the annexes were demolished and replaced by a congress building of the Maritim chain. The Shell House itself was excellently renovated based on the requirements of monument protection. This is because the brick nogged steel skeleton construction is a jewel from the early modernism period for two reasons: the complex grows in a vertical cascading fashion from the fifth to the tenth storey from the neighbouring buildings, while simultaneously flowing into the level ground in a wave-like form, in visual language terms, the architecture makes an immediate allusion to water. The building is one of the early and rare examples of organic architecture. After its renovation, GASAG (main supplier of gas in Berlin) moved into the building until the year 2010.

The property developer was Siemens AG, who built this white housing estate for the rapidly growing red “Electropolis” for employees on low incomes. Scharoun provided the overall draft. The houses were designed by a team of progressive architects, who joined forces under the name of “Der Ring” in 1925. The four and five-storey buildings located in a line between the public parks, are arranged in a north-south direction or east-west direction, therefore ensuring that all the apartments have as much light as possible. This meant they were to become the model design for the building of housing estates in the post-war period."

However, by contrast with the housing estates in Britz and Zehlendorf, the Weiße Stadt, literally the white city, only consists of apartment buildings. It was built on terrain, which already had a partially stipulated road routing due to an advance competition. Salvisberg, Büning and Ahrends were responsible for different parts of the housing estate. There were no uniform types of ground plans, but instead very different apartment designs and varied facades respectively have been integrated within an overall concept that is actually very homogeneous. The infrastructure provision of the housing estate consisted of 20 shops, nursery schools, a medical practice, chemists and a community laundry room. The description Weiße Stadt only applies in a limited extent as the buildings that are plastered in a bright white colour did indeed have fine colour differences on the windows, doors and the balcony railings. It is very true that colour was not such a dominant design element as it was with Bruno Taut, but modernism was not always as white as people liked to view it."

An aesthetic unit for residential, business and cultural purposes was built on the plot of land belonging to the Wohnhausgrund-stücksverwertungs A.G. (Woga) - with a cinema, theatre and cabaret. The complex integrated the perimeter block development of Jürgen Bachmann from 1927 on Albrecht-Achilles-Straße. The core of the miniature town is the Ufa cinema, that was converted into the ""Schaubühne” theatre by Jürgen Sawade in 1981. A lively building, which slows down the speed of the road in a wedge and is reminiscent associatively of a sink - a comparison, which justifies the particular interior light architecture."

The twin buildings were planned to be gate houses, whose function is emphasised by glass light rows. The appearance of the houses is characterised by bay-like steel windows and coquina stone (sedimentary rock that composed fragments of fossilized shells and invertebrates) panels. The completely glazed upper storey of the Berolina-Haus accommodated the legendary swing establishment “Cafe Braun” (later called Berolina), which, progressive as it was, could be accessed via escalators and paternosters (lift consisting of a series of linked compartments moving continuously on an endless belt). There was a garden with a lawn and a dance floor on the roof. Both gate buildings are an aesthetic example of the conversion of Alexanderplatz in accordance with the plans of the architect Hans Kollhoff."

The ten-storey building with its curved facade and cantilever (a long projecting beam fixed at only one end, used in bridges, highway signs) design continued to be the unique example. The Columbus-Haus housed offices, including the office of the architect himself, stores and restaurants until it was destroyed in the war. The house was a novelty with its new building technology, which included artificial ventilation.

The country house for Karl Lemke is one of two house projects that were completed in this period. The country house sits flush on its terrace area as an L-shaped structure: all the openings are glazed at wall height. The individual well-proportioned rooms are linked to each another by room-height doors. The draft for the original garden design stems from Hermann Mattern. The small country house with an area of 1,722 square feet was degraded to form a motor vehicle workshop after the war. It was later used by the state security service and, following the reunification of Germany, it was turned into a municipal gallery. It has been a listed building since 1977. After several alterations and reconstruction from 2000-2002, the building was renamed “Mies-van-der-Rohe house” and today serves as a modern art exhibition hall."

Based on this basic conception, his Protestant church at Hohenzollerndamm certainly bears objective traits. It has a cubic appearance but its clinkered exterior has been partially decorated and covered with gold in the style of expressionist architects. In terms of urban development, the church building assumes an important function by closing the perimeter block. The inner space is entered through a flight of outdoor steps and a Gothicised portal, formed by thirteen pointed reinforced concrete arches. Reference should be made to the Kreuzkirche built some years earlier by Ernst and Günther Paulus at Hohenzollerndamm in conjunction with Roger's church and the expressionist works which are left in Berlin."

The residential complex for low-income families, which was named after a tourist cafe in the vicinity, consisted of almost 2,000 residential units extending across a total area of 3.7 million square feet and was built right in the middle of a middle class location on the initiative of Martin Wagner, who was the head of the municipal planning and building control office, and the landowner Adolf Sommerfeld. The development plan (by Bruno Taut) was developed while predominantly sparing the existing trees; the buildings were integrated between the pine trees and the birch trees of the Grünewald. Each of the three architects who carried out the work developed a certain type of house, which blended in with the overall appearance. The ground plan solutions follow the rules of the new objectivity period, are standardised and minimised in terms of their traffic areas. The use of colour is seen as the most conspicuous design element, which based on Taut’s conception, should broaden or narrow the created exterior areas. This unique colour concept required special protection; yet the story of its preservation was not always worthy of praise. However, today, sections of the original colours have now been restored.

Richard Ermisch, who would later build the Berlin exhibition centre (no. 242), designed an arrangement around the fountain which used about 10,000 cubic feet red porphyries (a hard fine grained igneous rock containing crystals of feldspar). With the strict axial layout and the frame-forming hedges and flowerbeds, the premises were monumental.

It also marks the beginning of a completely new form of architecture: Hans Scharoun (no. 281) realised the same anthropocentric design principle with which he became world famous with the construction of the Philharmonic Hall (no. 307). The one-family house only protrudes slightly on the roadside. Towards the garden, its characteristic ridged roof has little in common with the ground plan, which is fanned around a roundshaped dining area.

The Reich railway’s senior government building officer Fritz Hane designed two fully glazed city vitrines which were pushed against each other and made of almost right-angled box girders (max. span 115 feet). In contrast with the masonry of the old stop, they rest on a foundation, which is clad in shell limestone. The lively restaurant at Hardenbergplatz was built in 1957 in accordance with Horst Engel’s plans. Subsequent reconstruction and expansion work always respected the quintessence of the design. The importance of the Zoo station as a traffic hub was considerably diminished by the main station, which took up operations in 2006."

In the rigid shell limestone facade design which encased a steel construction, contemporaries saw a “signal of National Socialist desire”.

In the neo-Classicist Kleine Festsaal, the small festival room, Hermann Goring “conducted” the bombs against England. In 1949, in the radically reconstructed neo-Classicist Große Festsaal, the large festival room, the GDR’s constitution was adopted. As the headquarters of the Zentrale Planungskommission, which controlled the East German economy, the building became the target of demonstrators on 17th June 1953.

Flat roof and white plaster facades of the research institute’s administration wing demonstrate precisely the simple elegance which was characteristic of classical Modernism. The experimental houses begun in 1932 on Brook-Taylor-Straße are manifestations of functionalism: the forms of the spin tower and engine test bench followed directly from the test arrangement. The large wind tunnel is a rolled-up tube of 26 to 47 feet in diameter and its reinforced concrete is a maximum of 3 inches thick.

All participants had to base their plans on the roll-call area with an SA monument which had already been created in 1933. In the end, the winner was Otto Firle, whose semicircular scheme was largely realised, apart from the road superstructures (see nos. 237 and 246, 262).

The characteristics of Mebes and Emmerich are visible in the horizontal window arrangement, the rows of stones that were set apart by means of their colours and the recessed balustrades on the ground floor.

Here the gardens were a disruption in front of the ground floor apartments, which were gradually replaced by shops. To give the boulevard a uniform appearance again up to the Olympic Games (see no. 235), a competition took place in 1935 among the great Berlin architects and garden designers, which was won by Arthur Peschel. According to his design, the pavements should be extended up to the houses and complemented by further display cases standing at crossways to the footpath, which are bordered by high walled beds. Although only the first stages of the plan were realised, the arrangement principle was still implemented after the war at least, it can still be seen today. In 1936, at the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, Paul Baumgarten constructed a remarkable Olympic Pavilion out of steel and glass, an unusual example of new construction in this period. The circular pavilion, which was to provide foreign visitors with information, was dismantled again two years later."

The National Socialists made it into an event which will forever be associated with their rule. If with earlier games the event itself, the immediate sporting experience, was the main focus of attention, it was now used as a platform to put the NS state, which had been discredited internationally because of the boycotting of the Jew's and race laws, in a good light, and to demonstrate cultural and economic strength and cosmopolitanism. This meant that for the first time in the history of the Olympic Games, all necessary financial and personnel resources for its implementation were mobilised by the state. However, this expense was possibly not only for a one-off event: Hitler may have already thought at this point in time that, in line with his intention of creating a “Great German Empire”, only one venue came into question for the games: Berlin. With regard to the architecture, the aspect of value creation and therefore the associated question of continued use of the facilities also played a prominent role here. If temporary wooden houses were built to accommodate the athletes in 1932 in Los Angeles, then at the Olympic Village in Dallgow, stone buildings were built which could be reused as barracks.
The architect commissioned with the new buildings, Werner March, who had constructed the nearby Sportforum (see no. 233) in 1928, wanted to use reinforced concrete and glass to build the venues. But Albert Speer (no. 225) revised the plan and had ancient arenas and theatres in mind. The concrete construction was clad in natural stone and was given a strong finishing ledge. March was able to have his way in terms of functionality, though - and he did this so masterfully that the Berlin Olympic Stadium (no. 238) could still be converted today at much less expense than its counterparts in Wembley and Munich.
The Games and their design principle had an effect on the whole city. At a breathtaking pace, which was never to be reached again, the S-Bahn was supplied with electricity, the stations of Zoologischer Garten (no. 228), Schöneberg and Reichssportfeld were reconstructed, as was the tunnel facility of the north-south S-Bahn (no. 252). There were also large infrastructure projects such as the Tempelhof Airport (no. 249). Finally, apart from the exhibition centre (no. 242), many squares and streets were also given a face-lift.
The Olympic Games of 1936 were a complete propaganda success for the NS state, which wanted to present to the world an illusion of normality which no longer existed. Their after-effect was ensured not least by the film director Leni Riefenstahl with her sensational documentary film Olympia in which she glamorised the athleticism in terms of the prevailing aesthetics of the time."

At 250 feet, it is the highest of the pillars which mark the passages of the main axis from Coubertin Platz and Olympischer Platz, Olympic Stadium (no. 238) and Maifeld. The quarry stone foundation holds the so-called “Langemarckhalle"" where the fallen of World War One were once remembered. It passes over into a stepped wall containing the Maifeld that is designed for 250,000 people, which, in the accumulation of ancient building types, forms the “Forum” of the Reichssportfeld.

The former headquarters of the Nordstern insurance bank forms the southeast segment in the U-shaped ribbon development, opening out towards the north at Fehrbelliner Platz. Otto Firle, who was also responsible for the overall concept (no. 231), began this project in 1934. In the middle of the T-shaped building is the main entrance, which is accentuated by a widely projecting canopy resting on two voluminous flagpoles. At the front ends of the building there are shaft-like arcades which reach over the pavements. Typical for the period, the natural stoneclad facade of the steel frame construction is divided by overhanging window reveals. Their vertical and horizontal links are unusual, as are the countless allegoric reliefs which make the facade seem particularly martial.

Its exemplary functionality goes back to Werner March, he lowered the field by 40 feet so that the spectators could enter the Olympic Stadium faster between the lower and upper ring and could spread out more quickly. In the west, the stands are interrupted by the Marathon Gate which the athletes run through from the Maifeld (no. 236). The antiquating design, consisting of narrow colossal pillars with a wide cornice (ornamental moulding just below the ceiling) and the stone-pitched facing of the reinforced concrete construction, can be attributed to a revision by Albert Speer (no. 225).

The fact that it took up almost the entire second floor becomes clear with the anomalous facade pattern in this area. In contrast, the front, with its thoroughly simple form consisting of sanded travertine (white or light-coloured calcareous rock deposited from mineral springs), recedes on Invalidenstraße as there were plans to broaden it at the time. When the Berlin Wall came down, the German post office built a series of new mail distribution centres in and around Berlin.

Richard Ermisch included this in his new design in 1935, but he completely disassociated himself from Wagner's idea of an exhibition landscape. To give the exposition act an exalted character, Ermisch built, at the site which was reserved for a free-standing congress centre, a 155-feet high hall of honour with shell limestone cladding, coloured windows and colossal pilaster (a rectangular column, especially one projecting from a wall) facades. At the palace at the radio tower, around 330-feet long halls and hinged buildings were connected alternately in the same characteristic style.

The Third Reich adopted this, even if they mainly used it for industrial buildings.

The Großer Stern was expanded from a diameter of 260 to 650 feet, the Victory Column (no. 86) was moved here from Königsplatz in front of the Reichstag building and raised by one column segment. At the outer edge of the roundabout, the monuments of the military heroes of Prussia - Bismarck, Moltke and Roon - were set up. The temple-like tunnel entrances at the edge of the new facility and the drum lights, which were replaced by primitive whip lamps and candelabras in the direction of the west in the post-war period, are today the only works of Albert Speer (no. 225) which remain in Berlin. In its militaristic impetus, the Großer Stern was typical of many designs for locations in the Third Reich. The Lustgarten, the Gendarmenmarkt and Wilhelmplatz were also redesigned at the time."

With this building, the architect managed a somewhat more practical solution than four years later when he built the Japanese Embassy (no. 259). When developing Fehrbelliner Platz (no. 231), Moshamer based the construction on the ideas of Firle and structured his building equally axially, putting the main entrance in the middle of the rounded square front. This show side was also more refined: it is clad in natural stone and window reveals and cornices are made out of shell limestone while the fronts turning away from the square were only plastered. The main building, similar to the former Nordstern building, was also provided with pedestrian arcades and, after the Second World War, a glass porch was added to accentuate the entrance. Today the five-storey building is the headquarters of the Rundesinstitut für Berufsbildung, as well as the flun-desarchiv (federal archives) department of film archives, and the Hauptzollamt (main customs office) for product tests."

In order not to disturb the mansion colony of Grünewald, Kurt Fleinrich Tischer designed a cautiously neo-Baroque castle with the moderate height of three storeys as well as hipped and mansard roofs. The main portal of the plastered stonework building is in the inner courtyard which can be reached through a five-axis passage bordered by columns in the main building at Bismarckplatz. It is only here that there is a travertine facade. Until 2005, it was the home of the Umweltbundesamt, which has since gradually moved to Dessau, and left the German emissions trading office in its place."

The entrance, however, was on Wilhelmstraße. The room order behind this was designed so that the distance to the employers seemed even greater: following the forecourt and lobby there was the 52-feet high “Mosaiksaal” lit only by roof windows. Steps resounded hereon the bare granite floor. Connecting with the “Runde Saal”, the round hall, which counterbalanced the bend of the property, was the 480-feet long marble gallery which was inspired by the hall of mirrors at Versailles. Hitler’s study was half way towards the garden. The Neue Reichskanzlei was knocked down immediately after the end of the war and its stones were reused in many different places (see nos. 264 and 271).

Built during the NS period as the eastern offshoot of the monumental north-south axis (see no. 225) as planned by Albert Speer, the airport was first used by the Allies on a provisional basis in 1945. On the city map, the ground plan has the shape of a huge coat hanger and still enables the exceptionally short access. One disadvantage of the shape is the limited number of aircraft spaces, which was particularly noticeable in the post-war period when air traffic increased immensely and the airplanes became bigger. Decided in 1994, the closing of the airport, which was delayed several times through lawsuits and citizens’ initiatives, was implemented in October 2008. The former airport terminal now hosts exhibitions and events, the airfield was opened to the public in 2010 and has since become a popular recreational area.

The building consists of three parts, with a court of honour formed by the recessed middle building. With the elaborate arrangement of the facade with rustic foundation, cornices and shoulder pieces, the house is closer to neo-Baroque buildings than to modern mainstream constructions of its period. A third of it was destroyed in the Second World War, but it was rebuilt at the start of the 1950s. Until the year 2003, many changes were implemented, the attic floor was developed and the facades modernised.

Concentrically around this skeletal structure, there are sixty buildings which are a maximum of three storeys high. The uncomplicated design with steep roofs typical of colony complexes in this period, in this case made out of reinforced concrete but conventionally covered, was supposed to give the soldiers the feeling “that the nation wanted to provide them with a homestead during their period of service"".

During the Olympic Games (no. 235) though, 23 million passengers could be taken on the northern section up to the stop Unter den Linden. Before this, the hellish construction tempo had taken Its toll: on 20th August 1935 the construction on the west of the Brandenburg Gate (no. 40) collapsed and killed 19 workers. When the underground city line was completed in 1939, the Potsdamer Platz station (no. 253) marked a high point of Berlin urban railway architecture which Is unparalleled to this day.

When he took over the office of head architect in 1924, the S-Bahn began to be supplied with electricity. To do this, Brademann built dozens of expressive brick transformer stations. Brademann proceeded noticeably more minimalistically, and Potsdamer Platz station was the highlight of his achievements. Although it is not designed as functionally as Grenander’s later work, it puts it in the shade in terms of elegance: the walls were tiled with white opaque glass which glowed thanks to lights concealed in the orange and black coronas. After it was deformed by the war and no man's land passed over it during the Cold War, the underground stop has been developing in a more grandiose way than ever since 1991. Two planned new entrances based on the cubic shape of the former Potsdamer Tor by Oswald Mathias Ungers were not implemented.

Detached, semi-detached or terraced houses were allocated according to rank. The planned community buildings, such as a casino, were not constructed. The “comradeship community of the SS"" was therefore a typical project of the homeland security style. It was attractive on account of its position in the Grünewald and the generous distance to the neighbouring houses even in terms of this classy area. For this reason, the properties are still popular."

Due to the fact that, as part ot Albert Speer’s plans (no. 225), more apartments were to be knocked down than built, the biggest Berlin apartment building project of the National Socialists was just a drop in the ocean."

The size and also the furnishings of the embassy were to underline the significance of Fascist Italy for National
Socialist Germany. The combination of representation rooms, residence and chancellery represented a new type of building at the time. The design of the monumental facades was based on palace buildings of the Italian High Renaissance. A fourth storey is concealed behind the principal cornice. The central projection jutting out on Tiergartenstraße with colossal pillars and a roofed driveway entrance marks the entrance for official receptions. Dark red plaster forms an attractive contrast to foundation and walls made of travertine.

After suffering heavy damage during the war, the building was left in ruins for many rears before it was completely knocked down in the 1980s. According to plans of the well-known Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa, the building was rebuilt as a Japanese-German centre and the limestone facade and the vestibule behind it - once designed by Cäsar Pinnau - were reconstructed true to the original with the remaining parts of the building adapted stylistically and provided with discreetly classical interiors. To the rear, an attractive Japanese flower garden was created by architect Rvonel Amemiya. With the latest expansion into an embassy with a consular department and residence section from 1998-2000, a new side wing was added on Hiroshimastraße. The stylistic affinity with the neo-Classicism of the main building is remarkable."

Its weight of approximately 15 tonnes is channelled into the ground by only a quite small bearing. Although the gauge marks hardly showed sinking, the result could not to be stopped: of the buildings of the central axis (no. 225) only the Haus des Fremdenverkehrs, reached the building shell stage. As the only preserved testament of Speer’s redevelopment plans, the weight for heavy load test is a listed building today.

After 1941, the work was intensified and it was mainly the less secure high bunkers which were built. Among these, this example stands out with its particular design: the axial-symmetrical construction is crowned by a powerful console cornice. There are central projections on all sides. Towards both Reinhardtstraße and Albrechtstraße, there is a round arch portico which is even adorned with strips of imitation stone. The concrete facades divide arrow slit-style windows. Following some interim uses, the building was sold in 2003 to the art collector Christian Boros, who had the bunker completely remodelled by 2007 to open a collection of contemporary art.

However, at this point, the Second World War was already in full flow. The fact that the building, which is now used by the Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf district office, was constructed at a time of material shortage can be clearly seen. Unlike the older natural stoneclad reinforced concrete constructions in the same place, it is conventionally walled and plastered and is, in part, more finely profiled. Quarry stone is used only on the foundation, on the corner and side projections and on the window edges. However, the building seems generously proportioned in the interior: the round court of honour lined with columns, which was designed according to the example of the Copenhagen police headquarters, and the second square have gigantic dimensions."

Suggestions were submitted which provided many more different building archetypes which were not even based on the existing roads. They also consistently pursued the ideal of a city suitable for cars with crossroads-free traffic junctions, pedestrian footbridges, etc. Sergius Ruegenberg even planned an airport instead of the Zoo. Although none of the proposals were implemented, the designs predetermined the complete reorganisation of the Imperial-Romanic forum into a modern city.

In this year Hans Scharoun (no. 281) drew the plan for the “Friedrichshain living cell” where he applied his idea of a new arrangement for the cityscape in the district, which was more than half destroyed. In only slightly modified form, this concept was implemented by the house architects of the “Berlin Homestead"" cooperative which wanted to provide its members with apartments as quickly as possible. When those responsible from the magistrate and construction ministry stopped the plans in the middle of 1950s, they already had five further modernistic lines realised in line with Helmut Riedel’s plans behind them which would not fit in with the politically sponsored project ""Stalinallee"" (see no. 296) or with the “Friedrichshain residential community"" designed by Hermann Henselmann (no. 331) next to the multi-storey building at Weberwiese (no. 274).

Plastered corner and recessed centre facades with ceramic cladding stand on a cross-symmetrical ground plan. The four apartments on each of the eight storeys each have four rooms which, at 215 square feet each, are well proportioned. The generous development includes, as well as a lift and main staircase, two additional secondary stairways.

It follows a pattern which is filled on the outside with a small stone mosaic. The entire ground floor is a reading room. Its fully glazed, trumpet-like barrel vaults formally carry the knowledge onto the street. With 10,000 books lent each day, the library is the most-used in Germany today.

Its founding chairman thus campaigned for craftsmanship and national tradition. As the first construction minister, Lothar Holz was also able to draw on plentiful resources for the party building which, according to the plans at the time, was built in a recessed location on Friedrichstraße. With plaster, indirect distribution of light, candelabras, ceramic cladding, exotic wood panels, natural stone floors and a shell limestone facade, his consultants, Hans Geriete and Erich Kuhnert, made it into an evidence room of building craft showpieces. Expanded in the yard in 1999 by a semicircular, glass conference bay window by Steinebach & Weber, the building today faces the central association of guilds in grandiose fashion.

Schulz, Horst Bauer","Commissioned by the German Bauakademie, from 1953 the prototype for the prefabricated residential buildings of the GDR was built. In terms of construction, it corresponded somewhat with the first Berlin example of this building technique which had come about in 1926 on Ontarioseestraße: the roughly three-tonne concrete panels were cast on-site and assembled by means of a rotary crane. The construction both here and there was admittedly not used as a design element and instead disappears behind a layer of plaster. Relatively elaborate decorative elements are applied on this in the style of the national tradition, of which a relief, in turn, was to typify the prefabricated construction. In the year of completion, it was first in the Soviet Union and then in the GDR as well that the slogan “building better, cheaper and quicker"" was announced. After this, the industrial prefabrication technique was to have priority everywhere."

The earlier dosed road development was removed in favour of solitary projects (Tele-funken high-rise and architecture faculty see nos. 299 and 319), which were positioned so that the rush of speed was accompanied practically by an “optical rhythm"".

Among many reconstructions, the only new building fits perfectly in with the classic architectures of the Forum Fridericianum (no. 32), whose damage during the war the GDR tried to remove over three decades. Hardly anything is known about the history of origin of the administrative building. Before at the same place, there were several commercial buildings and residential houses from the 19th century which were destroyed in the Second World War. The architect Richard Paulick, who also headed the reconstruction of the Unter den Linden State Opera House, designed the administrative and rehearsal buildings of the theatre in a simple, classic formal vocabulary, and here he adopted architectural elements of the Knobelsdorff State Opera House. The original building is connected with the opera house through a passageway under the ground. The origin of the historic decorative parts has not been exactly clarified."

The extremely thin, greatly overhanging concrete flying roof is held solely by the corner supports of varying solidity. The form of the Industrie-und Handelskammer building is therefore completely different to the adjacent new building from 1998 (no. 400), for which the six-cornered stock exchange pit in the court was knocked down, but it does have a similarly optimistic effect."

The associated circumvention of the western city centre according to an American example formed an important connection line for West Berlin, which was separated from the historic centre, just one year previously, the Berlin Senate had decided on the construction of a city motorway ring. For the fast ring road which, by 1960, had already reached Jakob-Kaiser-Platz and Detmolder Straße, entire city quarters were reinforced and bridges several hundred feet in length were built.

The thin brass frames, the large windows and the balustrade sections made of black opaque glass are of exquisite elegance. The simple layering of the dark window bands and white intermediate floors underlines the curve of the facade on the actually trapezium-shaped plot of land.

The Congress Hall was built as a gift of the USA to the Interbau (see no. 296). It consists of a glazed foundation of 300 by 315 feet in which conference, exhibition and gastronomy areas are contained. The actual eye-catcher is reached through an outdoor staircase which rises above the functional main entrance: stretching out on the concrete platform is the auditorium for 1,250 people, which is dropshaped in the ground plan but in section is wedge-shaped, meaning that there is space for the foyer underneath. The hall roof is in the form of a suspended shell. One of the two eyelash-like supporting arches of the roof, which rest on only two supports, collapsed in 1980. During the reconstruction in 1987, slight changes
were made to the roof form. In 1989 the Kongresshalle was renamed “Haus der Kulturen der Welt”, the house of the cultures of the world. It is popularly called the “Schwangere Auster”, literally the “pregnant oyster”.

Although different reconstructions have weakened this appearance, the Stiller shoe store is still the purest preserved example in Berlin of the “Nierentisch architecture” of the 1950s. Together with the monumental rationalism (see Industrie- und Handelskammer, no. 282), which was also widespread at the time, this typifies the attitude to life of the economic miracle that was gradually emerging."

Both here and there, the fronts were mainly tiled black and livened up with isolated pastel tones. Similarly decorative was the arrangement of the windows, doors and roof borders.

Wedge-shaped supports lift more than 500 apartments above the Charlottenburg forest and villa region. Constructed mainly as maisonettes, they are positioned in an L-shape around nine internal roads 330 feet in length. The ground floor is left empty. The shops which are usually found there are accommodated at half the height. Other community facilities are located on the roof.

The four-storey building, which is in the middle of a park landscape, basically looks like a hotel with its continuous balconies and a dais. The entrance, which is in the middle of the slightly dented building segment, leads into a fully glazed hall with galleries and an outdoor staircase. It was demolished during the course of renovation work from 2001 -2003 and replaced by a new building. Only the former dining and cultural hall remained.

The luxury of individual residences could, if ever, only arise if done on one’s own account. The houses in Radenzer Straße represent an absolute exception. This is because here the “collective” also planned the sought-after individual homes. The plan was tailored for a special target group: state secretaries were to move here. After a competition, individual and group interests joined forces in this project in which five apartments were connected in a row and had a shared garden.

The building was constructed on the ground plan of an elongated hexagon. The design of the high-rise, like with the Italian colleagues, is derived from its construction: the tips of the ground plan are accentuated by staircases on the outside. The four main supports show the variation of forces in the facade by tapering up to the 22nd floor. The contrast of the light-coloured supporting formwork with the dark secondary walls also gives an elegant effect. The balustrade sections were originally encased in green opaque glass. Today the house belongs to Berlin’s Technical University. After it was taken over by Telekom, several floors were converted in 2005 and 2007 into open-floor office spaces and conference areas.

The rolls of barbed wire were followed ten days later by improvisations from semi-finished parts from house building. In the following year the square concrete slabs with up to four layers of hollow square stone blocks on top were given a rear wall made of stacks of planks to the side held by concrete I-columns and crowned by a waste water pipe made of asbestos. From 1965, the front wall was also replaced by such a construction. These lines of defence - for propaganda reasons called an “anti-fascist protective wall” - were in no way for defending from attacks from the West, though, and instead (for example with effective vehicle blocks on one side) were solely against “attacks"" from the East The image of the Berlin Wall which people still remember today, however, goes back to a special development of the 1970s: the white-painted, self-supporting prefabricated L-shaped concrete sections which, at 11.8 feet, were higher than ever, and were supposed to be not just “low maintainance’ but “attractively shaped"" as well in order to silence the verbal attacks from the West. The original ""border wall 75’ still be seen at BernauerStraße, where it was rearranged into a memorial in by Kohlhoff & Kohlhoff.

The Socialist City Center,The Socialist City Center,International Style 1961-1979,,Alexanderplatz,52.5219814,13.413306,-,"No part of the city centre of Berlin has changed less since the Berlin Wall came down than the socialist city centre, Even official planners who still spoke in the plans in 1997 only of one global location idea had difficulties. The reasons are commonly the lack of history and the immense scale. The image of the small, the image of the small compact old town, which had stretched between the Spree Island and Alexanderplatz up to the Second World War, is used as an argument here.
After two thirds of Old Berlin was in ruins after the Second World War, there were, as a consequence, a lot of proposals to relinquish the centralistic city structure forever. The most radical came from Hans Scharoun (no. 281) whose ‘Collective Plan"" aimed to align I Berlin on the glacial valley. Against this, the GDR (in accordance with communist historical philosophy) saw itself as a constitutional product of historical development. In accordance with its principle of ‘socialistic centralism” it insisted on the primacy of the centre. In the year after its foundation, it passed a corresponding construction plan of Kurt Liebknecht : and the reorganization largely adhered to this over three decades.
He assigned the city centre its traditional function as a place of identification for the citizens, a term which was now confined to the working people, however. It was also new that the state instead of the city developed as a patron. This changed world view was to be manifested in a high-rise for party and government which was planned in front of the Red Town Hall in the early 1950s, not at the existent seat of the country's political leadership (the Spree Island). The ideological demands shrank Increasingly during the planning, however. After the East Berlin magistrate and the SED district management had prevented the high-rise, in the place of the city palace, destroyed In 1950, a house of the people was realized in 1976 (Palast der
Republik, no. 337}. An Ideological message was therefore conveyed solely by the finally realized statues at the Marx-Engels-Forum (no. 357) which were hardly of superhuman proportions.
In contrast, the actual dominant building is as clearly urban as politically neutral: the Fernsehturm (no. 322) completed in 1969 centered the city similar to the church or town hall towers of the Middle Ages. The surrounding free space with its tightly formed square walls and purpose-free ground layout also refers to the form of the communal campus of the early modern times. The ""heart of the capital"" therefore represents a historical building achievement of the former GDR.
Even the leap In dimensions represented ultimately only a transformation of the oldest maintained testament from medieval Berlin at the scale of a modern metropolis: at 1,000 by 2,000 feet, the urban free space may be, unmatched throughout Europe. But for the 3.5 million Berliners today, this is about as ample as the 140 by 210 feet of the old “Neue Markt"" which was built at the same location in the early 13th century when the local population was only in the thousands. Only the consistently robust details proved to be system-specific, the apartments, above average in number and consistently designed for average households, and the generally accessible balustrades on department stores and residential houses. The GDR could afford this luxury solely thanks to the socialized land and the intended egalitarian society. In contrast, such a waste of space in pluralistic, market economy-based metropolises has no chance. So the challenge remains to enliven the incomparably large centre on a lasting basis."

The satisfaction of the residents has increased in the meantime mainly thanks to the increased consumer and leisure facilities."

The former flow of traffic over Stresemannstraße and Lindenstraße was directed past the roundabout, with Friedrichstraße made into a pedestrian zone and covered the area up to the Landwehrkanal.

The first serious tenant protests ended this disastrous clear-cut policy: in 1973 at Klausener Platz, the oldest redevelopment area in Berlin, the block-by-block gutting of the back yards containing many buildings was also stopped. Between Schloßstraße, Seelingstraße, Nehringstraße and Neuer Christstraße, Hardt-Waltherr Hämer brought all existing houses for the first time up to standards tailored for the requirements of their inhabitants. The cautious urban regeneration was born and was also celebrated internationally. Its spiritual father Hämer later worked as Director of the International Building Exhibition (IBA Old, no. 355). More recent statistics show, however, that the social milieus which were actually planned to be preserved by the cautious modernization were changed much more by this than by new buildings."

With trade outsourcing, block demolition and resident involvement, which was permitted here for the first time, the strategies of both parts of the city came closer than at any other time (no. 334, Klausener Platz). The concept of the three blocks was transferred by Manfred Zache from 1973 to the ten times bigger area at Arnimplatz.

The building opened onto the city forum, with terraces on the Spree side and to the former state forum, on the island side. The central component was the house-high loggia connecting everything. To the north, was the Kleine Saal, the small hall (Volkskammer, the people’s chamber) and to the south the Große Kongreßsaal, the great congress hall, which could be adapted for everything that a 5,000-capacity auditorium promised in terms of entertainment. The rest of the building was also devoted to entertainment, in particular the 13 theme catering sections for a total of 1,500 guests. After the Berlin Wall came down, there was an intense, emotional dispute on the further use of this “house of the people"" after the government of the reunified Germany had become established in the Spreebogen area.

The first step on the contaminated terrain, however, was incumbent on the former CSSR which built over the south side from 1975. How difficult it was, is proved by the almost complete elevation of its embassy.

Chairs like in the big Palace or a spiral staircase to convey different step lengths were to aim at “people who grow” while comparable projects in the West were realized in small proportions suitable for “children”.

The architects remained true to their machine aesthetics so that the cruise liner in the aluminum dress appeared “out of style” when it was completed.

The structure is divided into foundation, main stories and penthouse, and when viewed more precisely the pattern of joints which comes from the prefabricated construction really catches the eye. These “constructive necessities” were covered up with pilaster strips and cornices. The main entrance of the hotel, which is on the corner of Behrenstraße/Friedrichstraße, leads into an octagonal atrium which stretches out over all eight storys and is concluded on the roof with a glass dome."

After “Old Berlin” was affected in the 1930s and completely destroyed in the Second World War, a collage was now made of eight (in some cases in a new location) reconstructed testaments from history (Nikolai Church, Ephraimpalais, Knoblauchhaus see nos. 2, 30, 31), as well as three- to seven-story new buildings with a total of 780 apartments. The pre-casting plants produced a large number of special forms for the first time so that the channelled concrete facades show medium-sized town rows of balconies and arcades to the outside and neo-Gothic gables in the winding inner alleyways. Gerhard Thieme added relief allegories, which are supposed to represent the development of socialism and the “city of peace”, seamlessly to museum-like interiors, guild signs and advertising pillars.

So on Friedrichstraße on the corner towards the River Spree a complex of profoundly conventional urbanity was realised from 1985. The two lower stories were reserved for trade, and on the floors above there are 131 apartments attached almost “seamlessly”. The restaurant in w the basement stretches under the new waterside path up to the Spree. Unlike the countless iconographic attempts with other prefabricated buildings (see nos. 350, 361), the new buiding parts look quite normally plastic here.

With the total of around 40 stations which Riimmler designed the principle of distinctiveness had to lead into “over-furnishing”. At the same time the tile sprees, gold-coloured wastepaper baskets and brawny installations of his later work underline that underground station construction in West Berlin served less of a transport function than the provision of employment.

In aesthetic terms, the new architecture sought the type of contrast that was typical in the 1980s. The new building consists of composite beams, which are brick nogged with a few bricks and a lot of glass. Apart from the locally derived balcony arches, which are based on the recessed houses at the corner of the Charlottenstraße and can be interpreted as an ironic commentary of the once planned widening of the roads, the grid tower is reminiscent of the publishing house designs of the classic modernist period, such as the Chicago Tribune competition of 1922."

When set against Jahn’s second coup at the Kufürstendamm some six years later, the Victoria Area (no. 482), the high-rise building on a corner seems to be more finely chased in overall terms and to be relatively more appropriate for the location. Despite the jump in scale compared to the heights of the existing buildings at the Kurfürstendamm the building represents a much less sensitive departure in terms of the style than the building around the Kranzler corner. At Adenauerplatz, Jahn let his building be concluded rib-like to the height of the fascia and stretched even higher to the sky with help from a filigree tower method.

Its construction and thus the refurbishment of an old textile factory in the middle of the former GDR border area, used for industrial purposes to an extent, threatened with decay, should become an additional motor for urban development in this part of the district. The concept grouped together professional representations with several event halls, rooms for permanent exhibitions, a coffee house and office spaces as well as studios for architects, designers and artists. Claus Anderhalten created a form of architecture for this mixture, which offers friendly and open room formations, and which modifies the industrial construction, while still restoring it in a manner befitting its status as a listed building. The white, clinkered facade that had been partially destroyed was renovated; the Assmann, Salomon & Scheldt’s architects’ office was responsible for the second construction stage.

The school’s concept in terms of its form was based on the abstract structure of a sunflower, whose draft had been revised several times. The individual structures are grouped around the dynamic centre point of the “flower”. Hecker explained that the basic design had been selected because of a “longstanding interest in sunflowers: their everyday nature, usefulness, dynamism...” In structural terms, the concept is expressed by means of five wedge-shaped building sections, which, whilst pointing to the centre, form lanes and paths in the style of a small village.

This collection of villas simulates a block in a dense urban environment although it is set in more rural surroundings. The entire formation consists of the groups of houses that are arranged closely next to one another and which are made accessible by means of private roads. The houses even stand closer together at their narrow sides than is permitted in the building regulations, whilst the cantilevered roof overhangs emphasize the intention that the buildings should tilt towards one another.

In terms of the interior organization, the master church builder Gottfried Böhm based his first department store on that typology, which was arranged around an atrium, from the imperial age. Grouped together the escalator access point leads upwards from here to then be coupled over at head height with a painting by Böhm’s son. The structural resolution of the facade can be regarded as a very free interpretation of a curtain wall consisting of supporting and filling parts. Glass curtain parts, which behave like inflated lengths of material swing between the slim concrete pillars that do indeed tower upwards. They form curved canopies, which firstly protect pedestrians and secondly represent a dual glass skin, which can be ventilated. At the eaves height, the concrete pillars link up to form a network of beams, which incline towards the roof junction like a hip roof. In overall terms, Böhm had adopted the type of monolithic department store in the form of the Peek & Cloppenburg building, which had already made the KaDeWe (no. 143) into a bastion of the retail trade a short distance from it."

be formed by Schwedter Straße, along which the Wall used to run. On the one hand, they positioned individual action islands in the back of the Jahn-Sportpark (for instance an amphitheatre).

Up until then, it had been administered by the GDR. Now the so-called Hamburger Bahnhof was expected to solve the confined situation of the Neue Nationalgalerie (no. 320) due to the fact that western Berlin had already been provided with a new transport museum. The late Classicist terminus construction (1846-47, no. 75) is the last remaining building of its type in Berlin. It actually only served as a train station for 40 years before it was turned into a museum after being supplemented by a glass hall. It was inaccessible after 1945 and exhibitions only took place in the house that had been partially refurbished from 1987 onwards. Kleihues addressed this situation by means of his actions (competition of 1989), left the three-aisle hall almost unchanged and, running in parallel with this, created a single aisle exhibition suite that is 260 feet in length with a light buoy. Art from the 2nd half of the 20th century is on display in an exhibition area of approximately 107,000 square feet - exhibits from the state museums in Berlin and works of the Berlin Marx collection. The arguments that Kleinhues' work on the building was too ""aesthetical” for a technology monument must be countered by stating that the station has also been used as a museum building in the past."

The following constructions were built by autonomous architects whilst the investor did not comprehend the division in equal parts: Kleihues himself designed an aluminium house for the eastern side of the block as well as the shingle link travertine coating of the Four Seasons Hotel. On the southern side Jürgen Sawade created offices behind a delightful facade that is as smooth as glass made of black granite, whilst Müller/Reimann renovated the Weinhaus Borchardt (Carl Gause, 1900). The Baroque buildings in the west were rounded off by Hans Kollhoff by means of constructive acts of strength. In the north, the compulsory 20 percent quota of apartments in the capital city was fulfilled by the first veritable residential building of new Friedrichstadt: In this process, Max Dudler Le Corbusier’s Unite concept (no. 291) imbued it with so much urbane grandeur, that it can hold its own with the ideal types of Kurfürstendamm (no. 145)."

The bridge based on the historicizing, Mark region brick Gothic style was built between 1894 to 1896 on the occasion of the Treptow industrial exhibition, based on the designs of the architect Otto Stahn (no. 108). The two towers were supposed to be reminiscent of a city gate, and the railway viaduct was supposed to resemble a cloister. As an important road link of the inner city the bridge was blown up in the Second World War and subsequently only provisionally repaired; only pedestrians were able to use the bridge from 1961 onwards. The towers were renewed and the railway viaduct section that had been destroyed was replaced by a steel construction based on the designs of Santiago Calatrava in the centre section (road bridge of König, Stief & Partner) as part of the reconstruction process. Calatrava had been commissioned with the task of producing an expert report on the entire bridge in 1991, but ultimately only the viaduct section was built based on his plans. This departs markedly from the old idea of the solid bridge by means of a new, elegant swaying element."
Quartier 205,City Block 205,The New Berlin: 1989-Present,1996,Friedrichstraße 67,52.5126154,13.3905721,Oswald Mathias Ungers,"Quartier 205 is the only building section of the Friedrichstadt-Passagen (see nos. 393,394) to fill out an entire block. In this process, Oswald Mathias Ungers covers the entire repertoire of urban elements by means of his quadratic module. The square is just as suitable for street facades, roof systems, courtyards and arcades as it is for apartments, offices and stores. The critics feel this large form consisting solely of individual squares is monotonous, whilst the fans of this style admire the potential variety of the combinations. The spatial structure under the facade cover is due to the core structure and the six individual buildings grouped around it. The projecting and recessed parts, which result for the development of the complex, simulate the former plot structure on Friedrichstraße. In functional terms the block does not offer anything other than the standard “Berlin creamcake”, which has stores on the lower floors, offices in the centre and apartments on the upper stories. The ingredients of this cake do not really want to be mixed up in the Quartier 205. The living section of all places that is let for high prices with a view of the Gendarmenmarkt is rather more reminiscent of a fig leaf of the use mix. The Berlin building director Stimmann described Quartier 205 as the biggest planning error of the post-war period not least due to the huge effect of the building upon the Gendarmenmarkt (no. 13)."
Quartier 206,City Block 206,The New Berlin: 1989-Present,1996,Friedrichstraße 71,52.513474,13.3899161,"Pei, Cobb, Freed & Partners","Quartier 206 is the most expressive and possibly also the most striking structure of the Friedrichstadt-Passagen (see nos. 392, 394). The view of the building at night & particularly striking, the appearance of well-lit facade elements is reminiscent of the electrical illumination of the city buildings of the 1920s and 30s. Pei, Cobb, Freed & Partners neither spared any costs in terms of the opulence and the keenness to base their design on former structures for the building design facing the road nor facing the courtyard. Light, material and the experimentation with shapes revealed a sense of drama, very untypical for Berlin. In the atrium, a curved stairway winds its way up to the first gallery on the luxuriously decorated stone floor. The underground design also differs markedly from the adjacent quartiers of 205 and 207; this is because the three blocks are linked to the Friedrichstadt-Passagen at this level. The roofing of the atrium assumes a folding structure, which has a rather complicated but inelegant appearance, which is made of glass and steel rounds. The street facades of the block fold, buckle, turn inside out and protrude, here and there they suggest a tectonic structure and undermine it again at another point. The property developer built a luxurious form of architecture befitting a city of fun and excitement by means of this block."
Quartier 207,City Block 207,The New Berlin: 1989-Present,1996,Französische Straße 23,52.514702,13.3902259,Jean Nouvel,"The rounded corner of the Galeries Lafayette introduces a new element into the morphological vocabulary of Friedrichstraße. However, what is more noticeable to the eye is the entirely glass facade of the building which is apparently transparent but ultimately provides the impression of being grey or black in color. It causes confusion with insights and reflections and also indicates the internal organization of the block, which is fitted with a series of large and small lighting cones throughout, in the form of screen-print graphics. The office areas and the residential section that is laid down as a percentage are accessed away from the department store. You are plunged into the galleries upon entering the buildings and you are only confronted with two light cones of different sizes, spanning across all the stories, when you are in the heart of the building. They hold the viewer in their spell, as a luxurious optical work of art, which is enhanced by the glass and mirror surfaces, is developed there. Therefore, the actual function of the department store takes a step backwards; the sales floors appear to be low and seem to be ousted by the illusionist space conception. This block that is located furthest to the north is linked underground with two more of the so-called Friedrichstadt-Passagen (see nos. 392,393)."

They actually celebrate their leaders as managers: After the Bonn “Baracke”, a shack where the board meetings virtually took place on the streets, had made the SPD more democratic in 1970s converting it from a workers’ party into a people’s party, now a commercial representative structure in Berlin has superseded the Rhine’s landscape of open policy. The chairman now sits powerfully, enthroned at the top of the compact office block, whilst the board hall located behind it presents itself in a more restrained light. The same-shaped atrium, in which exclusive events will take place, does not drive a wedge into the management floor. All the panes of glass are tinted blue and are not overly transparent Helge Bofinger aesthetically imitated a trade union building of IG Metall that was constructed by Erich Mendelsohn in 1931 at a location that is a mirror image in terms of its city ground plan (no. 207)."

Until the construction of this new office building. The biconvex building, which Berlin natives dubbed “lemon”, was hoisted above the motorway where it now appears to float along the motorway above the rising stone basement in an elegantly curved form. Office floors with an abundance of natural light that are protected from emissions and noise are situated behind the double glazed windows. The bold charm that the building on the side of the motorway exudes is no longer Just a characteristic of the entrance front at Kronprinzendamm. The special feature is solely the symbiosis of traffic and the curved glass facade."

The investor consciously decided in favour of a form of architecture, which was based on the historical hotel construction, but without copying it. The new Adlon is now double the length of its predecessor due to the purchase of the neighboring plot of land on Unter den Linden boulevard. The new building wallows in retrospection. The building with its facade made of light plaster and sandstone elements has a uniquely timeless air with its dormer windows, balustrades, and ledges next to the clear, modern new buildings in the neighborhood. The intended grandeur of the interior suffers due to the fact the height of the stories has been reduced as a result of an additional story being added. The hotel was expanded several times - in 2003 the Adlon Palais was added, while 69 rooms and suites near the Behrenstraße were added in 2004 and a third presidential suite in 2006."

The elongated block, where the eaves is 90 feet high, has provided the city with a new landmark at its southern end in the form of the 280-feet high tower which can be seen from a distance. This does not remain a lone fighter, or at least not in the new city district It marks out the territory of the global player along with the high-rise buildings of Kollhoff and Piano/Kohlbecker. The large group building itself does indeed exclusively accommodate the standard office buildings, but its exterior does not really adequately reflect this functional monostructure. Its facade that is paneled with terracotta is given a rhythmic form by being subdivided into sections that are 150 feet wide respectively and becomes increasingly transparent due to the changing proportions of stone and glass as it rises upwards. The core of the building is the 260-feet long and 44-feet wide hall, which is rounded off with a glass roof at the height of the ninth story. A range of reflectors provide light. The dimensions of its giant atrium correspond to the nave of Notre Dame in Paris. As a semi-public space, this cathedral of commercial success is accessible from the central square of the Debis grounds located to the north. The building will thus also be accessed from the northern side. Lifts lead up to the higher stories whilst space has been reserved for the group’s own promotion of art in the southern section. In addition, a cafe, canteen and auto salon an be accessed from the atrium. Orbiting arcades run along the length of the frontage to the north and the west of the building."

A wide-ranging 13,000 square feet stretch glass roof, which is hardly perceptible from the outside, unfolds. The visitors view the hippopotamuses at a level beneath the water level, which allows them to view of the entire artificial living space of the animals. Even if the house does not compare with the magnificent tradition of the colonial zoo architecture, it is still an example of modern animal husbandry in which the hippopotamuses are no longer put on display on a stage but can instead look for areas where they can retreat in their enclosure. Solar collectors on the roof ensure that the water has a constant temperature of 18 degrees."

The building had also been propped up at the head and tail end. The connection to the old building of the chamber of industry and commerce (Franz Heinrich Sobotka, Gustav Müller, 1954/55, no. 282) was hardly solved, and the public pergola facing towards Kantstraße was not realised. Set against this, the atriums of the building are impressive, which, covered in cut single glazing, unfold beneath the parabolic arches. More than 155 feet of room height unfold there whereby the suspending brackets upon which the story ceilings are based form the element that characterizes the rooms. The resplendent form consisting of its “structure, room and skin”, which was intended for the building can be best recognized at its rear. There, you will indeed find an armadillo resting on gigantic metal paws."
Invalidenpark,Invaliden Park,The New Berlin: 1989-Present,1997,Invalidenpark,52.5296619,13.3759477,Christophe Girot,"In the “new city of Berlin”, the structuring of open spaces was much more modest than the large numbers of buildings constructed to fill gaps, of which one is the Invalidenpark, now lined with ministeries. In the 18th century, the invalids who lived here worked on the plot of land, before it was converted into a park in 1843 that was designed by Peter Joseph Lenne. The ruins of the Gnadenkirche that was devastated in the Second World War, and was later a border area, stood there until 1967. The rousing monument of the current park area is a narrow, granite ramp sculpture that people can walk on, which rises up out of a wafer basin. Interpreted by Girot as “showing the way into the future”, the “sinking” piece of wall should be viewed as a metaphor of reunification since it was officially inaugurated on 3rd October 1997. Strips of granite and grass are weaved into one another in the controversial design, which can hardly decide whether it should be a park or a monument. The Invalidenpark increasingly turns to stone facing the southern side whilst it increasingly becomes a green landscape with older trees towards the north. Therefore the park with the characteristics of a monument only has recreational value in the latter section."

In an unparalleled act, the architect who had built the severely criticized neighboring museums from the 1980s had previously been stripped of the right to carry out further planning work (see no. 311). The Stiftung Preußischer Kulturbesitz, the Prussian cultural heritage foundation, decided to stick with the planned new building at the Kulturforum although the unification provided the option of now merging the separated collections of paintings on the Museumsinsel (no. 50). The basement was converted into a study gallery because it had to accommodate more paintings. The elongated, rectangular structure with a modern rusticated basement and terracotta facades has again adopted the eaves height and the building line of the historical buildings. In this process, the Villa Parey was integrated within the Sigismundstraße whilst the Villa Gontard was integrated with the Chief Management building of the state museums in the Stauffenbergstraße. The visitor enters a central pillared hall via a rotunda as a connecting element to the buildings of the Kulturforum. The surrounding exhibition rooms are based on classical museums with their dark parquet floors, the colorful wall tapestry and the daylight ceilings."

In this process virtually everything had been stipulated by “Master Kleihues”, the number of stories as well as the eaves height, the facade design and the way it was opened up. At the southern perimeter edge of Kronestraße/Friedrichstraße Theo Brenner constructed a cuboid with a facade made of greyish green dolomite. Water Stepp's corner house at the Mohrenstraße is panelled with Red African granite, whilst the building made by Vittorio Lampugnani and Marlene Dörrie has a facade made of bluish grey sandstone. However, the central element is Kleihues' office block in Friedrichstraße, which makes clear allusions to its creator by means of its notorious “Ship shape” optics - porthole windows in the entrance area and a front projection design in the shape of a ship’s bow. The visitor is greeted by a spacious atrium with a glass roof in the block interior, which was designed by the architect himself."
Lindencorso,Lindencorso Building,The New Berlin: 1989-Present,1997,Unter den Linden 21,52.5166207,13.3897757,Christoph Mackler,"The most powerful element of the building that reoccupies the corner block of Unter den Linden/Friedrichstraße boulevards, is the facade. The limestone in the lower three stories is solid and built with self-supporting facing brick walls, the corner and edge stones are also solid special items. As is now customary, the natural stone facade is suspended in front of it in the upper stories. All the stones are channelled horizontally and jointly produce a sculpture surface appearance together with the vertical joints. The building has the appearance of a bastion in accordance with all the rules of critical reconstruction and the appearance of depth of the external wall is further enhanced in the arcade area due to the fact that the sandstone colored pillars stand out from the darkly designed entrance shop window zones. In the interior Mäckler has adopted a rather conventional approach with the office building and in some areas of the residential building. The ground floor zone is now used by a domestic car manufacturer as a showroom for luxury brands. The building’s special feature is its insistence upon “genuine” stone architecture. Up to now, it has the only contemporary solid facade on Friedrichstraße."

The core idea of the young Frankfurt-based architects, who won an international competition in 1992, was a “green bridge” between the Jahn-Sportpark in the east and the former border sector in the west, which was transformed into a Mauerpark (no. 388) under the directorship of the garden designer Gustav Lange. Following on from this, a wall covered in grass was built, which continues the backfilling of the existing stadium and ends as a straight glass wall at Falkplatz. By looking through it, you can see both embankments in which three triple sports fields as well as the adjoining areas are located. The centre of the hill ranges above a fishbelly made of steel, which covers the largest mujtb purpose hall in Berlin which has up to 10,000 seats."

The rear offices are accommodated in two narrow side wings whilst the inner courtyard was sealed with a glass roof. The decoratively designed floor made of three different natural stones and the design if the rear firewall with open stairways are extraordinary. The facade also demonstrates a mixture of materials and designs that is typical of Mäckler's work. Whilst the major portion of the street facade creates a very compact impression due to a multilayered ashlar plaster the construction at the main entrance opens up in an expressive gesture with explicitly contemporary materials such as exposed concrete and metal. The main ledge with the window roofing that protrudes powerfully adopts a motif of the “Lindencorso”, which Mäckler previously constructed along Unter den Linden (no. 405)."

Its unconventional form is the result of the development of an apartment building where the power consumption levels do not exceed 40-kilo-watt hours per square metre in the year. The building plate with its sloping sides curves convexly in a southerly direction. The northern facade has an almost dismissive appearance with its heat insulating uniformity, which is only interrupted by narrow window slits. The southern side reveals a horizontal structure facing towards the living spaces thanks to the continuous rows of balconies with transparent side rails in front of the warm glass fronts. The generous use of glass makes sure the house takes on a crystalline, dazzling appearance between the dominant grey of the WBS-70 standard panels. However, it will take some years before it can be established whether the lower power consumption levels will amortise the increased construction costs."

Whilst the building is large and unambiguous, the gesture of this building at the cutting edge of the high-rise suburbia and the village-like suburbs is equally unchildlike. A green, shimmering row of houses consisting of artificial stone runs some 1,000 feet along Prendener Straße in Hohenschönhausen. The intention of the planners in this process was to bring order to a disparate area of urban development and to still respect two existing development models at the same time. The long, slightly curved building tract corresponds to the scales of the major housing estate made of prefabricated slabs. The “stone houses” which slide away towards the open countryside are reminiscent of the rural area of Wartenberg. All the classrooms have been built facing away from the roads and sound-insulated despite the giant shop window that was recessed within the long complex and which should signal openness. Max Dudler also feels that this school building has a “wealth of asceticism” due to the very fact that the structure of the building does not impose any form of conduct upon the pupils but has the effect of stimulating their imagination."

On a plot of land, which formerly belonged to the Humboldt University that is located in the vicinity, the architects constructed an independent building, which does not only accentuate the city area by means of its red facade, on which the broadcaster’s logo is emblazoned, but also takes on a different type of public appeal due to its premises that are open to the public. The building is made accessible by an extensive foyer on the Wilhelmstraße and runs along the river Spree, with a sweeping form that reflects the bend of the riverbank. The side wings frame a glazed plaza that is located on the side of the river, which attracts employees and flaneurs with its restaurant and the beautiful view. The facade at the Wilhelmstraße closes around a room height glass opening in the centre, whilst the building’s facade facing the river is accentuated by its reserved symmetry. The offset facade openings of the basement, the main stories and the two top floors reinforce the calm impression - with the exception of the long corner window on the fourth story, which makes it possible to catch a glimpse of the notorious news supplier, the Reichstag."

Hans-Joachim May and Günter Andrich converted the temple of transportation, which Johann Eduard Jacobstahl had built in 1882 into a vantage point with a crystalline platform hall on a basement resembling a barrier in 1964. In 1994, a project was commenced which was supposed to make the station more efficient than ever before in terms of both the transportation technology and the commercial side of matters. Chestnul/ Niess cleaned up the old viaduct and supplemented it with a genuine basement as well as an attached facade that resembles a showcase. It exhibits the Fin-de-Siecle-Bijouterie and also the subsequent constructive acts of strength. The railway arches were opened for the first time for 50 new shops, which were expected to refinance the investment. An open transit area was created in which old and new, passengers, flaneurs and consumers merge so seamlessly with one another and resembled the way in which Alfred Döblin once described Alexanderplatz in Berlin. The platforms of the U5 and U6 lines were provided with light-colored granite floors, while the platform of the
U2 line received a new asphalt floor. Since 2010, the extension of U5 to the main station is being implemented."

By dint of this schizophrenic nature* the Bezirksamt Mitte is in fact very representative of Berlin following German reunification. It demonstrates in the same way as the three subsequent city hall projects, which the city council addressed since 1990, that the property developer by the name of ‘democracy' did not act so eloquently as it did at a national level. Built as a seat of parliament from 1996 onwards, it was rendered virtually useless once again due to the merger of the district. It is all the more interesting that the design was also based on the styles used in the early 1960s. The Bezirksamt replaced the Hotel Berolina. But its cubic shape was retained to protect the collection of buildings. The story ceilings do, of course, protrude between the facade tiles, which are for their part blue, which ensures the new skeleton structure has a much more plastic appearance than Josef Kaiser's panelled complex. In addition, it is now really possible to walk through the building, which ensures that the idea behind the location has been accomplished. The metropolitan thoroughfare in the form of Karl-Marx-Allee (no. 289) and Schillingstraße which is a red light boulevard now really do cross one another."

The Bundespräsidialamt was the Federal Republic of Germany’s first constitutional body to transfer its official residence from Bonn to Berlin back in 1994. The three-winged, classical palace complex (M. P. Boumann, 1785-90) consequently required an additional administrative building. The unconventional ellipse, where the external skin is completely covered with black glowing granite, is clearly based on the palace and its architectural scale in terms of its proportions. The hermetic exterior of the building befits its lofty position as the office of the President of the Federal Republic of Germany. 124 offices that face towards the Tiergarten and the hall that is roofed over with glass have all been designed in white and are flooded with light. The dictate of the ellipse determines the entire room configuration and thus also stands for elegance and noblesse.

Its facade is covered with bright coquina stone panels, which for their part ensure that the steely block constructions of the centrally arranged winter gardens stand out. In this way the emphasis upon the vertical lines assumes a character resembling a relief. The 70 apartments, some of which are maisonette apartments, are a dutiful concession by the property developers of the Rosmarin-Karree to the standard local 20 percent residential accommodation quota that is stipulated for new buildings in Friedrichstraße."

It was originally supposed to be called “Neue Hackesche Höfe” because it was based on the structure of the “Hackesche Höfe” (no. 144) opposite that were built some one hundred years previously - but this name was forbidden due to the risk that people might mistake it for the original. The young architect duo Bellmann & Böhm who gained their first work experience in the latter phase of the GDR’s existence and built the “Quartier Schützenstraße” (no. 427) with Aldo Rossi, designed a collection of twelve individual houses, which are grouped around the quiet inner courtyards. In this way the historical perimeter block form of development will be restored at the same time. The mixed use of restaurants and bars, shops, offices and apartments ensures that there is a lively atmosphere at the popular Hackescher Markt. The traditional approach loses something due to the exaggerated colorfulness and the lack of consistency in terms of the details."

The glass surfaces, which are chamfered in some cases, of the almost rectangular rows of windows that are set deeper and the axes that have a bulky appearance may meet the facade design specifications, but imbue the building with the character of an Agent Provocateur. The architect allows this almost unbearable tension to be released in the building's interior. Surrounded by the offices that are distributed between four subterranean floors an atrium spreads itself out there, which gives the appearance of being an amphibian between the strictly and soberly designed floors, by means of the unusually, expressively distorted roof constructions above the integrated auditorium. A genuine Gehry building without any doubt. The southern building section that is raised to a level of ten stories with apartments behind a staggered facade on the plot of land that is 138 feet wide and 335 feet long is adjacent to Behrenstraße and allows the onlooker to forget the direct links of the building to the confusing front facade."

The modules of the Dresdner Bank, Liebermann and Sommer houses (Kliehues) is well as the Palais am Pariser Platz (Winking) are considered to be the most rigid results of this debate. The Dresdner Bank faces the square with a Stone shadow mask, with a 49 percent proportion of windows in accordance with the constitution. The sandstone facade and the granite basement create the appearance of being a copy of previous works. However, this facade manages to break out of this strict corset by means of independent solar protection elements. The actual bank building opens up behind the square’s wall: The circular hall in steel and glass, roofed over with a lightweight design, is reminiscent of an amphitheatre. Meinhard von Gerkan solved the conflict resulting due to the rectangular cut of the plot of land the circular hall by placing the stairways within the spandrels. The ascent within the hall is made via a spiral that rises on its own within the rotunda. The fact that the building’s exterior had to be held in check to accommodate the constitution and the spirit of consensus, which had been achieved with difficulty at times, was compensated for by the investment in careful details in the building’s interior."

It is also not exceptional that there are two apartments per floor of differing sizes of 860 or 1,160 square feet in the seven-story building. It only stands out in terms of its exterior by means of its balcony railings that appear to be transparent made of fine-meshed steel fabric and horizontal rows of windows. The apartments themselves have a “loft-type’’ open ground plan without room partition walls. An additional special feature is the mobile collapsible wall that can be pulled out throughout the entire length of the apartment, and stands at a slight angle in the rooms, which can be pushed together like a curtain to a compact length of 6.5 feet. It conceals or reveals the open kitchen and bathroom areas. The majority of the residents opt not to use the additional turning/sliding wall variants to divide up rooms that were also developed by the architect. The building was given its name due to the Estrade, a height projection along the window facades of 1.2 feet and almost 6.5 feet in depth at the ceiling and the floors."

Gerlach, 1735, no. 24) strikes into the city like a bolt of lightning. On the one hand, it has its special formal position, and on the other hand, it formulates the fault line of Jewish history. Libeskind created a very intellectually and structurally challenging work of architecture by means of the large-scale form of a Star of David that has been folded upwards. This demanding concept was also continued with in terms of the implementation details and in the process also made impossible constructions possible, such as wall pieces that “float” freely in glass surfaces. The construction follows an abstract network of reference points of Jewish culture and history in Berlin. Diffraction and confusion are stylistic tools. So-called “voids”, areas that people cannot go through, were an option to implement the unspeakable for Libeskind - the destruction of Jewish life. ""However, the building was also subjected to some modifications of its basic design (competition 1989). It was thus impossible to implement the sloped position of the external walls. Even when empty, i.e. without the exhibition that opened in 2001, visitors were attracted to the building in droves. By September 2007, Libeskind added a glass foyer to the old building that was used as the entrance space. From August 2010, he converted the Kreuzberg flower warehouse into a new addition to containing
a library, archives and museum offices (no. 548)."""

The condolence hall that extends throughout three stories of the building is located in the core of the cube. At the same time it is the most prominent room of the complex. “Distancing rooms” are extracted from this huge hall by means of 29 exposed concrete columns, in which individual groups of mourners are separated from one another, but can still remain united in their mourning.

The Marzahn major housing estate was created between 1977 and 1987 (see no. 374). It stood for an East German innovation in the field of housing construction, however, in this case the standardised panels were grouped together to form city figures covering large areas. The ratio of open spaces vis-a-vis the structures ultimately continued to be “inhumanely” overstretched in this process. More recently improvements in the living environments, refurbishment programmes and, as in this case, the closure of gaps and supplementary buildings, have been used to add other urban spatial qualities to the former “elite district”. Walter von Lorn designed a band shaped development to subsequently consolidate the estate. The administrative building pulls the living cubes together with it like a locomotive. Steel pergolas, shaped as covered walks, connected the individual structures. The ground floor zones are reserved for small trades. The courtyard, lane and the square form new configurations, which have to contend with the surrounding multi-story buildings. The use of brick for the facade is also as alien as the basic shape of the collection of buildings; however, in overall terms the attempt to integrate two city models has been successful."

Its rugged location in urban development terms ensured that the new building would have to be able to assert itself. The smoothly plastered brick of the building with a sports hall located on the second and third floor, a cafeteria, school administration rooms and the teachers’ rooms was positioned on the plot of land in such a way that another street corner was created once again. The simply designed building is connected with the classrooms of the old building via a glass wing. The entire school complex is made accessible from the entrance that is divided into three sections and is deeply recessed. And the school building has also succeeded in setting a new trend in other respects.

In the case of this research institution, it was important to keep the development expenditure to a minimum whilst exploiting the available area to the maximum extent by means of large office spaces that can be darkened. The building formations (they reveal themselves as “outstanding colorful characters” within the academic site of Adlershof) were additionally built whilst taking account of the trees. In the three-story laboratory and office wing the internal structure of the building is arranged around a central axis made of “use strips” of a width of 23 feet and a depth of 23 to 66 feet. The swaying facade area consists of a double glass skin. The architects selected a simple steel construction with glass external walls for the smaller, single story hall building, which is used for major experiments. The coloring of both structures is actually their most attractive feature. Alternating color spectrums were used for the mounting of the concrete parts. The buildings really start to shimmer when the colorful Venetian blinds are lowered as the sun shines."

At first sight, the collection of buildings conceals the fact that it was built as “a united and integrated whole”. This historical parcelling out of the block’s interior, which was supposed to serve as a basic prototype for the new plans, is also revealed in the external design. The distinct facade design that excels with bright colors skillfully represents the small-scale nature and the juxtaposition of the historical and functional mix, albeit commercial and office rooms, a residential building as well as a hotel, are concealed behind it in the main. The collage of six different, historicizing facade designs characterizes the appearance of the perimeter blocks: The cute copy of the courtyard facade of the Palazzo Farnese in Rome is the most striking feature of the Schützenstraße. The roof design is intentionally reminiscent of the Paris Mansard roofs. The inner courtyards, which are entirely on a par With the interior in terms of their wealth of details and their design, are also well worth seeing."

In terms of its ground plan, the building has been planned in a meandering shape with two four-story wings. The architects still succeeded
in shaping the facade sections in very different ways despite the longitudinal extension. Protruding and recessed sections interrupt its monumental style. The wooden panels have a pleasant appearance as the external claddings, the positioning of the columns provides the street facade with and a special sun screening system consisting of vertically arranged solar protection slats is the structuring element on the facade. The basement and the roof zone are continuously linked in their design and hold the building together: an innovation centre for environmental technology must also stand out itself by saving energy. In this sense, five pillars help to ensure that the building is environmentally friendly: building Ilf conditioning via the cavity ceiling, a sun screening system to prevent the facades getting too hot, optimized daylight incidence, the photovoltaic facade of the entrance hall and the rainwater management system."

The existing building was adapted by Kollhoff and Timmermann, whilst a new building was added to it by Müller and Reimann. This extension has to fulfill two main functions in urban development terms. It must cover up the front facade of the old building without losing the perceived link, and it must redefine the urbane space around the Werderscher Markt. The cube of the new building, which k continued throughout the width of the old building, is broken down by means of three bulky recesses. Two courtyards and a city loggia provide an insight into the functional, but high quality, administrative building. The reception courtyard opposite the old building serves as the main entrance; it was issued with an elegant column design in correspondence with the existing building. This newly created external area serves as an access point for official visitors. In functional terms the Mf building accommodates dual rows of offices and a comprehensive library with a reading room. The fact that the suggested structural transparency is .not just for the sake of appearances is proved by a visitors’ centre that is open to the public."

The decision in favor of the tender for the unusual school and nursery school complex was made back in the period of the red-green coalition, which had set itself the objective of achieving the “ecological reconstruction of the city” by which it also meant the conservation of small, ecologically important green spaces. Therefore, on the school plot of land, a comprehensive room allocation plan of almost 100,000 square feet was to be accommodated on the one hand, and on the other hand, the existing trees on the rear section of the plot of land were to be preserved. The playground and the external sports area were transferred to the enormous roof platform so the trees could be saved. This extends across the whole length of the building of 584 feet. The roof structure rests on V-shaped columns and is secured in place by lattice steel side parapets.

The height of the building and its colors obviously break the rules of the immediate neighborhood, but the high-rise building also alludes to the nearby towers of the Axel-Springer publishing house and the giant buildings on Leipziger Straße. During the age when the Wall still stood, the two latter buildings had been built as ideological fence posts on either side of the border. In 1961, the architects Paul Schwebes and Hans Schoszberger built a high-rise building here in the former press district, which the GSW used. The new building is based on it as an elegantly curved plate, makes use of old and new spout heights and precisely copies the building lines despite all its dynamic features. The architects developed a ventilated skin for the slim disk structure, the solar protection elements of which provide it with changing appearances, which are visible from a distance, ranging from soft pink to Bordeaux. The uniform Friedrichstadt road copes easily with this eccentric building coloring, but if such buildings became the rule then they would probably lose a lot of their impact."

On the western facade, the Panke river has been opened and passes by the ministry as a moat. An adjoining building and a separate extension building designed by Max Dudler were built as the old building could not meet the space requirements of the ministry - there is only sufficient space for the management sector here. The new buildings make use of a strictly cubic architectural language. They are based on the scale of the old building, and imitate its block structure but not its facade design with decorative elements and structural elements. The new buildings have a strictly regular degree of windowing throughout with a generous ratio of glass in relation to the stone curtain wall.

Promoted to the position of master planner for the industrial sector by means of this concept in 1994, he supplemented the MA stone facades and steel supporting frameworks to make them appear like they once used to: He implanted shops and offices with lots of glass, a great deal of aluminum, some stainless steel and also by means of the use of black paint."

The large format, with which the Berlin youngster, Bumiller, blew away the competition for the Moabiter Werder in 1993, was berated shortly after completion as “the largest disaster of the Berlin rebuild”. The yellow brick fronts, which remained inflexible, and apartments without balconies, which did not surpass the standard of council housing, provoked a building vacancy of around 70 percent: at the beginning.

The newly created, no longer divided building blocks blur the preceding structures, which were defined through small-scale designs and the contours of the Baroque period. The headquarters of the three associations are reflected in the discreet differences in the grey of the sandstone cladding. The infrastructure of the building, like the conference tower, is communally used. This is also the case for the inner courtyard, which is covered in a glass structure and serves as an internal communication zone. The development pulsates with the shoreline towards the River Spree. The building edge to Gertraudenstraße follows the former alignment of the street and, in doing so, cements the multiple tracks of the east-west connection. What are noteworthy are the different modulated noise protection window variations. In total, there is more reason than emotion in the Shape of Ibis Berlin block.

Here, the old building of the Academy was joined by a representation building of the Hutsche Bischofskonferenz, a conference hotel and an office building, which all surround a small ceremony room like a core building. In terms of town planning, the architectures relate to the idea of a “monastery in the city” and allow physical space to work together in interplay with the buildings. The St. Thomas of Aquin Church is surrounded by a reinforced concrete pergola, a type of repose cloister with connected garden courtyard.

With the design, Thomas Van den Valentyn drew, as he did a few years previously with a music school in Weimar, from deep within the richness of quotations of the classical modern era. Freely suspended landings in the outer area, a roof garden as a detached high space, which is available using an expansive ramp - these details appear like quotations from architecture history through to the 20th century. The spatial organization of the building conceals a concrete cylinder, 66 feet in diameter, behind the hermetic, right-angled cubarture. This concrete cylinder, in turn, is located over a two-story “wooden^ events room.

The fact that this open space with trees and fountains is a result of the surrounding buildings, is already apparent in its paving, which continues under the bordering rows of columns. The building with small green rear courtyards has different usages: office and business spaces, a hotel and apartments. In the upper floor of the southern part of the house, there is also a kindergarten which has small pavilions on the roof. The varying facade design fits visibly to the use behind it: this means that the higher office spaces are distributed on less stories than the apartments. The simple, dark stone facade, heavy brass and solid wood verify the elective affinity, which has dealt with the shape and material."

In the 1930s, the Lustgarten was altered with a pavement covering. This needed to be reacted to with contemporary means in the middle of the 1990. So, in 1994, Gerhard Merz tried to seal off the Lustgarten with a bus stop backed up against Karl-Liebknecht-Straße for this reason and in 1996, in a renewed expert proceedings, Gustav Lange suggested terracotta-potted box trees, which were unsuitable to the Berlin climate. However, Hans Loidl, who had occupied second place in both of these proceedings and was now directly commissioned, was the first to succeed in realizing a modern interpretation of the Lustgarten. For the layout, he orientated himself on the historical design of Karl Friedrich Schinkel (no. 44). This was aligned with his central axiality to the preceding construction of the Dom. However, Loidl alluded to the modern Dorn in his conception."

The sober overall impression is thwarted by the irregularity of the deeply incised opening for windows and doors.

In order to hold the large events of Green Week, Bautec, the International Consumer Electronics exhibition and the Tourism Exchange in Berlin, the covered surface was increased by a story from 1 million to 1.7 million square feet at a cost of 1.8 billion Deutschmark. After the competition of 1990, the two-story hall wings of Marshall-Haus (no. 269) had grown towards the south, where a second main entrance was built on Jaffestraße. A system of tunnels, ramps and connecting bridges, stretching miles, allows vehicles to be able to drive right to the exhibition stand. All hardware is subordinated to a square grid, which appears to the outside as terracotta-filled steel lattices. Whether the trademark of the old architect master, Ungers, who had already erected the Frankfurt Exhibition hall, inspired the Berlin trading centre is however questionable: its purely rational black boxes are considered “out of style”, since the industry leader, Hanover, built glass meeting points for the Expo exhibition.",

Inside, the open styles of Rauchstraße are taken up and converted into themes such as the courtyard, square and block. The contours of the six different individual buildings, five embassies and a communal house, resulted from the building lines, the tree population and the incisions of the passages as well as the southern opening of the plot of land. National architects realized the individual embassies on the basis of the overall concept by Berger + Parkkinen, the public communal house “Felleshus” contains a lobby, auditorium, exhibition area and conference rooms.

After he wanted to put it under quarantine at the beginning with a giant roof, he only picked up Paul Baumgarten’s conversion from the 1960s in the end. Anything which then re-revealed itself to be war ruins, he supplemented generously and simply with steel and glass. In the retreaded plenary room, which is the largest in the Western world with 17,216 square feet, the visitor tribunes are pushed so closely to the parliament members’ places, that the guests can read their files. What is unique is the fact that the people can practically “raise the rafters” on their representatives: After a long argument, a modern replacement was found for the dome which exploded in the 1950s. As well as a mirrored cone for lighting and ventilating the plenary room, the oval high-tech construction contains two counter-rotating platforms, which allow you to look out on both the representatives and, predominantly, the city."

In the course of time, the Gründerzeit era house had lost its stuccoed and appliqued building ornaments. The Munich architects, who already provided impressive solutions to the reconstruction question in 1945, resorted to the historic drafts with a scale of 1:100 and replicated their design in a relief. During the plastering, CNC-milled plastic moulds covered the areas of the building in which the drawing features lines. The resulting combination of negative reliefs of the historic decorations and sketched shadows in a greatly enlarged drawing mode created a multilayered facade. This effect is multiplied further by the fact that the building’s plan and implementation are not matching and subsequent changes thus also intercept the plan. This rather understated facade renovation references and puts into a modern context all possibilities of rigorous reconstruction and the equally obvious non-reconstruction of the historic layout."

However, in the end, some shop interiors can, at best, impress, which were designed by differing architects. As a whole, the building is rather reminiscent of European city buildings of the worst possible kind. The interior of the five-story vertical mall are generous and nicely simple; however details, such as the ceiling lights or the fixing of the shell plates on the tower of the lift are a sloppiness, which doesn’t let itself be confused with style. At least, Kantstr has gained profile with other design settlements."

Zwick used materials to translate this industrial context into an elegant gap solution that provides access to the premises located behind. In, contrast to the surrounding whitewashed buildings, a panel facade was created of timber, metal and concrete, which protrude at an angle from the row of facades, temporarily resulting in sharp incisions to the building line. The reconstruction of the industrial buildings created generously proportioned commercial areas especially suited for media enterprises, while a renown restaurant and a wine shop also settled in the area.

The core building of what later became the Reichsbank stemmed back to 1690; over the coming centuries, numerous conversions and additional building took place. There were already plans to expand the Reichsbank back in the time of the Weimar Republic. The architect, Heinrich Wolff’s first sketches wanted to replay to the inflation with a symbol of stability. This plan was taken up under the National Socialist rule. Adolf Hitler himself decided the competition of 1933, into which Gropius, Mies van der Rohe, Poelzig and Tessenow had entered themselves among others. When the official residence for over 4,000 bank employees was ready, its safes also accepted the stolen gold from Hitler’s campaign of destruction. The cubic capacity seems to take hold like a casting of the terrain; a representation facade shows itself towards Werderscher Markt. The block is interspersed with several courtyards. The GDR, which used the treasury from 1959 for the central committee of the SED, symbolically denazified the “Nibelungen refuge” by removing Nazi reliefs and the light banking hail was replaced by a “black box” for conferences. This refusal, typical for the division time, of historical continuity was continued by the Auswärtiges Amt on the one hand, when they allowed the building to be supplemented though a newly built cube (see no.. 436). The old building on the other hand was transformed by Hans Kollhoff in 1995. This allowed everything to survive which was good in terms of trade, and supplemented the rest in an equally solid way. color surfaces by the artist Gerhard Merz connect the layers to an overall piece of art work, which represents the united Germany excellently."

Nowadays, long since re-included in a perimeter block development, it now accepts any institution, responsible for questions of the future. The building’s career began as a barracks wing under Friedrich II. During the Weimar Republic, it was used as a police school and shortly after the Second World War as the Institute for Civil Engineering. After the foundation of the GDR, it housed a part of the building academy and served later as the diplomatic presentation for the Federal Republic of Germany in the GDR, the quasi embassy. The sober master building and the attic studio (Hans Scharoun (no. 281) planned the reconstruction of Berlin here) was restored and renovated after the Will came down and was supplemented by a laterally starting timber frame. Here, at the new construction, the shape infringes on the otherwise clearly necessary restraint. The upper story overhangs, touches on few supports and, as metaphor for the department for research and innovations, has a somewhat over-orchestrated effect. However, it risks at least moulding the street front. In the reclosed inner courtyard, there is still a relict from the Permanent Representation of the Federal Republic in the GDR, a bright garden pavilion, which had been build originally at an event building but also had to receive all the many GDR citizens who wanted to leave the country."

For the new building, which is connected directly on the Hotel Adlon (no. 397), an additional piece of land was purchased, to be able to come to grips with the spatial demands of a modern embassy. For the time being, the building is easy to spot due to the strict building regulations which apply around the Brandenburg Gate (no. 40). Nevertheless, Wilford’s building comes up to standard in all points to subversively slip in the British eccentric character: From the brusquely cracked, sandstone facade, which is structured in line with the guidelines, two brightly colored structures peak cheekily from the top of the first story, where the visitor centre and the auditorium are located. Many things on this building are subtle. Surprisingly the light inner courtyard with a high English oak tree, which is situated just behind the entrance onto Wilhelmstraße. It forms the beginning of the change between open and closed spaces. A step leads into the winter garden, which serves as the reception room. The office floors surround the courtyards in a U-shape and, with their balconies, allow insight and outlook onto events. Even the would-be mansard roof with its prepatinated copper glaze turns out to be a curtain like concession to the building regulations: it conceals a simple flat roof. The architects succeeded in the feat of submitting the editions flawlessly and creating a building whose demonstrative external strength behind the inaccessible facade is ironically interrupted."

In close intervals, these surface-dressed prefabricated supports stand, like a curtain before a uniformly, glazed facade.

In this clad construction, so developed for the purpose of ecologically correct ventilation, a six-story ellipsis-like structure was erected like an inverted stranded ship hull. This structure opens out onto an atrium open on all levels, which tapers towards
the ceiling. On the ground floor, there is a bistro, main and sub-foyers and conference rooms, which can be joined together with the main foyer to form an events room for up to 300 people.

The journalism association, which could see across the Rhine Republic with its “Haus am Tulpenfeld"", was at the point of being in danger of actually losing its dominant position, because numerous news producers found their own respectable market places in Berlin (see no. 161, 411). This was compensated through a construction vis-a-vis from the “Band des Bundes”, which concentrates completely on its core task. From 1998, a typical Berlin block developed, above which the conference room alone rises. Placed on its south side in the piano nobile, 16 feet high and completely glazed, the greyish marbled frames represent an absolute visual shaft, which is directed towards the chancellor and the members of parliament. On the other hand, the 600 offices look completely neutral: their facades resemble a test card thanks to the lightly crazy staccato pattern made of black basalt and the luminous fields."

The strong four-story perimeter block development surrounds a circular, completely glazed lecture hall, which breaks through the facade with a two-story glazed circular segment on the west side. 14,000 square feet of office space are placed in stone wings. The uppermost story is provided with a glazed relaxation mezzanine, as is sufficiently well-known from numerous bank and management buildings. The room can be expanded using mobile partition walls to a 32,000 square feet large “conference landscape” on the entire ground floor.

The overall stocky impression does not reduce the timelessness of the design in any case. All details substantiate a tasteful planning and design without the pretentious ornamentation of the contemporary luxury palaces, the villa uses classic proportions, avoids decorations on the facades and does not make it look ridiculous with its determination to be present.

The metal facades, above which will-o’-the-wispish reflections flicker, is only interrupted by tiny arrow-slit like holes. The immense four-axis projection, which marks the entrance area, is in curious contrast to the clumsiness of the cubature.

The terraces which develop from this, with wood-planked floor and circular railing play with the associations to arks and sea. The building fronts to the garden are completely glazed and the lightness of the lounge areas is strengthened more by the beech parquetry.

The actual sports halls, planned from the occasion of the (failed) Olympic bid in Berlin in 1993, were immersed onto a green hill, covered in blooming apple trees and are, from a distance, as good as invisible.

Since 1919, the Confederation has been using a former city palace in the Spreebogen (Friedrich Hitzig, 1875) as its consulate. It resisted both the megalomaniac conversion plans of the Nazis as well as the bombardment in the Second World War. Today, laying parallel to the “Band des Bundes”, the embassy building is a relict of the old vacated district known as the “Alsenviertel”. The Basel-based architects Diener & Diener constructed an extension building which was the same height but somewhat deeper, immediately next to the east side of the old building with its vast representation and residential rooms. Instead of the generous three stories of the old building, the new building has to accommodate the diplomatic and consular duties on five stories. It breaks away from the existing building less through the cubature and more through its own language of materials and the changing windows throughout the building and gives a self-confidence counterweight to the palace in perfect exposed concrete architecture. The artist Helmut Federte designed a wall layer with blind windows from the western compartment wall."

The Jakob-Kaiser-Haus occupied an area of Dorotheenstadt, a Baroque city expansion area once characterised by residential and trade houses and later by institutional buildings. With the two-part building formation, above all, the Reichstagsgebäude (see no. 106) retrieved its urban facade. On both sides of Dorotheenstraße, two thirds of the representatives' offices, the meeting rooms of the party members and other functions of the Federal Government and the Bundestag are situated. Five architect offices came to a solution which differs from the old plot structure. Towards the River Spree, open courtyards and main buildings arise. The entire ensemble has an effect like a versatile but not irregular puzzle. The Berlin ruling on building heights earmarked a height scope of six complete stories and a penthouse level. In addition, three listed and renovated original buildings are integrated: the Reichspräsidentenpalais by Paul Wallot, the Kammer der Technik and the Haus Sommer."

This building was destroyed in the Second World War. For the 1996 prize competition, the corner plot at the entrance of the new diplomatic quarter in the Tiergarten was selected. The European open architecture competition made the decision for Hans Hollein, who was able to build his first building in Berlin since the construction of a city villa on Rauchstraße. On the corner between Stauffenbergstraße and Tiergartenstraße, an ellipse-like entrance building with an attached U-shaped cubic building part is located between the solitary buildings of the Diplomatenviertel and the neighboring Kulturforum (no. 311). The festival and representation areas of the ambassador are located in a striking copper-clad head structure, which is available with a multi-story foyer near the passenger drop-off area. The four-story flat-roofed building part in U-shape includes the consulate department towards Stauffenbergstraße, In the rear part of this building, reminiscent of a city villa, there are flats. While the multitude of inner rooms have their appeal, the heterogeneous exterior comes across as an “architectural goulash”."

The building complex, whose garden facilities extend over the Spree, has a clearly east-west orientation. This is emphasized through the different designs of the facades, which seem to melt into both the garden and the Ehrenhof (courtyard of honour). In the management buildings, the architects have succeeded in creating noteworthy rooms. On the other hand, northbound and southbound, the building has a rather abrupt and abrasive effect, which is also not compensated by the large semicircular formed openings in the middle management building ascending from the complex. Even the sandstone claddings along the longitudinal axis are proof of the misdirected cost savings: neither the building owner nor the contractors wanted to take the responsibility for the original idea to build the entire building out of white concrete."

Open installation cables, visible support structures, bare steel as well as many ecological accessories should have saved around two thirds of the costs and made the building into the exhibit for structural engineering. In addition, the series of closed clinker walls intimate at the library laying behind them.

As well as the federal states of Lower Saxony and Schleswig Holstein (no. 472), Brandenburg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania also combine their state agencies into one building. The independency of both federal states was to find its expression in the material selection of the facades and to the communal garden complex. Dominated in external areas by a strong Prussian screened slate facade, the northern character of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania was meant to emerge in an interior facade clad in pine-wood. The garden complex unites pines, originating near Brandenburg, with water surfaces. Together, both the L-shaped and different height building angles separate a multi-story hall. From here, an event area is developed in the ground floor; in the upper stories there are management and representation areas."

The architects designed a positive-negative game in the duplication of a cube with a 66-feet edge length, as it was planned as the ideal measurement for the city mansions designed in the development plan. On the avenue side, a glazed atrium area as high as the building is cut out of the cube, which was added in the rear part as a connected mass. This positive mass is, in turn, surrounded by a stone walkway construction formed from an ideal dimension.

With the canopy-surrounded cosiness from the post-war prosperity, the new sharp-edged glass block no longer has anything in common. The multi-part building had to incorporate the listed low buildings and the former Bilka department store, however this forced association has a rather tolerated effect. Like a giant, the multiply folded building ensemble provided with inner courtyards with its pinnacle on Kantstraße kneels over the lower Bilka roof and greets the Kurfürstendamm with the dominant gesture of technocracy.

The opening of the wall during the renovation led to violent discussion because it meant a clear incision into the listed mass of the building which had been windowless until that point. In contrast to the Universal building, the neighboring Spreespeicher (built between 1907-1913) has been clearly more cautiously renovated, as modern elements fit almost seamlessly into the historic building.

The fundamental order, which is characterized through this, is determined by the symmetry of the diagonal and allows neither vertical nor horizontal emphasis. Instead of that, the direction neutral principle of the network results, which also allows for the connection of the stone and glass strips between the first and fifth upper floors on the square side. The facade is clad in smooth, yellow Roman travertine. The opening of the building occurs through the main entrance on Pariser Platz.

The urbanite structure remains completely preserved: the L-type basic shape of the building forms a place, on which the large-scale test buildings from the 1930s (see no. 230) stand as if on show.

After the fall of the Wall and the German reunification, the contemplative quarter awakened from its politic-induced numbness. The former Diplomatenviertel with the kudos of a residential suburb was meant to become the address of the embassies and state agencies once more. The architecture competition for the state representative of North Rhine-Westphalia plumped for the Düsseldorf-based office of Petzinka, Pink und Partner in 1999. Crucial for the decision of the jury was the innovative construction of the building, which was exemplary in terms of ecology but fitted explicitly modern into the upmarket development of the Tiergartenviertel. The load-bearing structure consists of ten parallel-structured, multi-hipped steel frames, which are connected to each other through slabs and edge beams laying in between them. The facade design followed the main idea of a glass, open house. The installation of an air conditioning unit could be avoided as the concept allowed for natural ventilation. On the roof, a photovoltaic system was installed, which creates a part of the energy which is required for the operation of the building."

The part toward the street stayed open except for the entrance in the middle. The rear is covered by a 66-feet high concrete cube, whereby only its left half is used by the parish: huge wooded gates are followed by a democratic room with hidden confession cabinet, chairs and plaster, raised only a little, running through it, around the altar. It is hardly possible to marry, pray or come together in a more lovely, inspired, casual setting. The right half of the cube is an empty, inaccessible tunnel into the void.

Standing on a 56-feet high platform, visitors see 230 feet of the former death zone of the inner-German border, which has been largely preserved with its various zones and was already put under historical monument protection in 1990. The documentation centre was built in 1964 as a community centre for the Sophiengemeinde Protestant community, which had been divided by the construction of the Wall. It was recently remodelled by Zerr, Hapke, Nieländer to suit the function it has been serving since 1999. While the new observation tower maintains a formal distance to the former watch towers, its metal mesh cover nevertheless creates an uneasy feeling.

This is opposed by the small windows, which allow the base of the building to become visible as such, making the glass entrance in the closed foundation zone appear even more permeable. Behind the closed facade facing the Pariser Platz, the L-shaped plot contains seven individual buildings as well as an embassy and raised ambassador’s gardens, all of which constitutes a small city district by themselves. In line with the city district concept, a passage crosses the entire building. The fourth floor is even accessed by a birch promenade.

Elaborately designed roofs form the conclusion of the characteristic horizontal tri-partite division which links this building to the structure of its neighbors.

The employees of the Bundestag have a total of about 731,700 square feet of usable space in 600 rooms at their disposal. The three story round library tower is the heart of this system, which is closed off to the city on three sides but then opens to the Spree. This area, the Spreeplatz, has remains of the Berlin Wall, an outdoor staircase and a terrace of sculptures. Work began on the extension of Luisenstr in 2010.

David Chipperfield knew how to endow the 390 to 3,800 square feet flats with a plastic hull that looks like a polished jewel case because of its rounded corners. The irregular distribution of its windows, balconies and loggias first creates an impression of an erratic design, but on a second look they fit in nicely with a vertically oriented structure. The foyer and lobby likewise breathe the spirit of a matter of fact modernity.

The old building was expanded by the addition of a lower building whose narrow side extends to the street, creating a big ground floor area for the fleet. The facades of the upper floors are covered in oblong colored boards in harmonious color palettes. They consist of laminated sheet glass, which was screen printed on the rear to ensure the extended durability of the pigmentation. Illuminated from the inside, the color pattern is also visible at night. In accordance with the different functions and the color codes commonly used by the forces in Germany at the time of construction, the building segments are dominated by a palette of firefighter’s red-white and a palette of police green-beige. The color scheme therefore directly indicates the function inside. While the color scheme does not equally represent firefighting and police, its intensity strikes a balance nevertheless. At the border between the two functions the shades are increasingly matched while a few ""wrong"" pixels prematurely enter into a strong complementary contrast."

After all superstructures were removed, the ship’s hull was fitted with a swimming pool. Two platforms extend in parallel to the ship and with similar dimensions from the footbridge, creating open areas above the Spree. Since 2005, the bathing ship is turned into a winter bathing ship between October and May. The fitting of elliptical glued-laminated timber trusses as the frame for a double-layered pneumatic PVC membrane, which reduces the structure’s weight and thermally insulates it, results in three translucent tubes that are used as a lounge, sauna and pool ship with views of the Spree.

It is Berlin’s largest station and the most crucial railway hub. It combines long-distance, regional and local traffic in the shape of a tower station In which the tracks are positioned at various levels above each other. Long-distance travel crosses the station through a tunnel on the north-south line, while local traffic on the east-west line leaves the station towards the east on bridges across the Humboldthafen, which are part of the design. The crossing lines were the basis of the design. The above-ground platforms are covered by a basket arch-shaped glass hall with a slightly curved layout. It crosses the glass arched lintel roof of the railroad hall in the north-south direction in a cross vault. This hall stands between two office blocks with an external steel framework that extends as bridge structures across the basket arch hall, thus connecting both halls. In addition to the building, a court case is also noteworthy in which the court decided in favor of Meinhard von Gerkan as the designer who objected to the building owner’s cutting the hall by around 426 feet, and especially against replacing the prestigiously curved shape of the lowest hall by a simple suspended ceiling.

The first, third and fourth floors feature common areas for the seven residential parties above the commercial use areas on the ground floor. Throughout the Middle Ages and far into the Modern Era, cities had primarily consisted of wooden buildings, which often resulted in devastating major fires. Therefore fire protection was a special consideration in this project, for example with the separate stairway tower. The architects, who are specialized in wooden constructions, conceived a quickly assembled building made of prefabricated elements for the bearing frame (a pillar-ledger structure made of glued-laminated timber), the facade elements, the ceiling system (wood concrete compound), the roof, as well as the finishing.

The building with eight freehold flats for art collectors resulted from an arts project to create a sculpted northern end of the Rosa-Luxemburg square initiated by the Verein zur Förderung der Kunst und Kultur am Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz e.V. The architect and the artist designed a “Würschtelbude"" (German hot dog stand) which evolved into one of the most promising designs of the city. The multiply aligned and dislocated volumes of the black solitary building transverse standardized eaves heights and regular facade designs - crevices, a towering elevation, extensions, closed walls and punctiform openings in exposed concrete seem almost deliberately maladjusted to the still dominant rational sandstone grid facades of Stimmann (no. 404). Only the US Embassy (no. 516), was able to create a small break in the facade style due to its complex security requirements. On its inside, the conglomerate which was untried into a monolith through the uniformly black surface, offers bright flats ranging from 220 to more than 980 square feet of floor space and up to 23 feet in height across six stories, as well as commercial areas on the ground floor."

The embassy, an apartment for the ambassador, and the consulate are spread across two basement levels, four aboveground stories and a stepped level. The original design came from Gerhard Bartels and Nabil Fanous, the latter received the Aga Khan Award for architecture in 1998 for the Tuwaig Palace in the Diplomatic Quarter in Riad (1985 in collaboration with Frei Otto, Büro Happold, Omrania Associates). Fanous moved his company to London in 1986. This Berlin building comprises a main volume with a half rotunda positioned in front. Both volumes are glazed, but the half rotunda features sun blinds of perforated metal panels. These are ornamental in nature, symbolizing the traditional Arabic love of decoration, which became particularly sophisticated because of the ban on incorporating images of Muhammad in Islam. The facade is dramatically lit at night The entrance into the orthogonal main building is through a solid ‘gateway' in the glazed facade - typical of the post-war modern style. The inclusion of large hermetic, geometric forms was also prevalent in this tradition. Large characters can be seen on metal ‘gateway’, this is also a connection to another important genre of Arabic art - namely calligraphy. The embassy building successfully fuses modernity with tradition."

Two small sheds were removed and a new modern building added that projects out over an old coffee roasting facility. This rather wide main volume has six axes and redefines the appearance of the site. The asymmetric construction and the single main story above the rustic ground floor have an unpretentious historic charm. The top floors of the surrounding buildings were partially destroyed during the war and these have now been reinstated and given a modern interpretation with lots of glazed surfaces that nevertheless correspond to the historical silhouette. The revitalization work is clearly visible, but the conglomerate character has nevertheless been maintained. The mixture of functions - trade, residential and gastronomy - has also been preserved, although numerous commercial spaces are now used by media companies."

Instead of repairing or reconstructing the old facade, the architects have copied the original design but deliberately also emphasised which sections are new. This solution has preserved the appearance in its original form, designed by August Tiede, but also offers a modern interpretation that meets current requirements in terms of the building’s usage. The scientific collection is extremely sensitive to daylight, so the existing facade was first improved and the window openings were sealed with suitably colored bricks. In order to reinstate the missing facade sections, prefabricated concrete elements of up to 323 square feet were made from silicon impressions taken from the existing facade. These story-high elements have the same texture and details as the existing facade, but are very different in I terms of their color and scale, material, and fabrication."

The original building was part of the ”K66” series, a series characterized by bands of windows on an elongated volume positioned behind a closed volume housing the entrance and a staircase. These typical characteristics remain visible even after the renovation work, but the facade has been remodeled and thus sets itself apart from the other buildings on the Frankfurter Allee, which extends the Stalinallee (compare nos. 263, 274, 289, 297). The building is set back from the Frankfurter Allee, positioned behind a green buffer zone. This gives it an independent character and makes it an eye-catching reference point on the street. Vertical lamella with just a few vertical cedar-wood openings give the library a modern and unified appearance. The lamella are set at different angles which alter the way In which the light falls inside. The large rooms inside have been given new arrangements and shapes.

The entrance onto the pitch divides the new building into two parts, leading players past the building and onto the pitch below. The rooms not only serve as changing areas, equipment rooms, and toilets, but also as a place to shelter during bad weather and a space for events and parties. A ramp winds around the building, thus making the stadium barrier-free. While the ellipsoid form deliberately echoes the shape of the stadium - it once housed a cycling track - the brick facade is a nod to the adjacent listed ensemble comprising a church, town hall and fire station. The two central rooms are lit by skylights that also optically connect the buildings on both sides of the passage.

The vertical glass panels give the building a striking character and also prevent the interior from overheating. The sections near the bay windows are also glazed from floor to ceiling, drawing as much light as possible into the open-plan offices. At the rear of the building, the floor-to-ceiling glazing comprises sliding doors with textile sun blinds spanned on stainless steel wires. The wires are positioned at slanted angles, thus creating a crystalline play of lines on the blinds. The ground floor is used for commercial purposes. This is split by a passage that makes the space narrower (landscaping: Kamel Louafi), but to counteract this, the block has been extended in depth, which has the added advantage of creating a terrace for the rooms on the first floor. A terrace on the roof is also open to all employers. To the north behind the foyer is a stairwell featuring artwork by Antje Schiffers that offers a new spatial Interpretation."

Nevertheless, the varying window sizes and their random distribution, combined with their arrangement as projecting boxes set at angles, clearly show that this design also deliberately seeks to set itself apart from traditional facade design. The large windows face the south and can be closed with rolling blinds when necessary. The remaining windows are small and give the facades a more closed appearance. Just a narrow band of windows at the base of the building offers views Into the 16-feet high art gallery below ground level.

The temporary building for the company Happy Shop is designed for use from four to eight years and has a simple timber construction that can be dismantled easily and reconstructed at another location. The floor plan comprises four parts, each with its own color scheme and serving different functions. The biggest and highest room is conceived as a flexible sales area. Based on the mechanisms used for a theatre stage, this has a motorized system of steel wires that hold the clothes on display and these can be pulled upwards to free up the space for events. This divides the room into the stage and stage house. The horizontal separation has also been made visible on the walls: the lower section is painted grey, and the upper area is clad with plywood boards. The purple atelier also functions as a planning space, and a green service area completes the ensemble.

The concept idea behind the renovation and extension works by Clarke und Kuhn was to maintain the original building but to create a new location that would improve the urban site and also increase the dynamic use of commercial space. In order to achieve this flexibility and integration, the architects limited themselves to the use of just a few constructional components and materials and to integrate the intended users in the planning phase right from the beginning. This meant that the individual rooms could be developed by the tenants themselves and are also flexible enough to adapt to future needs. An extra story and a five-story new building have been added to the former factory. Important features of the new building include the striking join between the new and old buildings, where it has intentionally been made clear where the old building ends and the new begins, and a two-story covered forecourt in front of the building. The latter functions as a public space, offering a wealth of opportunities and presentation areas for visitors and tenants alike.

The landscaping was designed by Topotek 1, although Litfaß-Platz remained undeveloped as the remains of the former Garnisonskirche are located underneath it. The development divides the entire block into two volumes arranged around inner courtyards; a small pedestrian zone is located between the two buildings. The master plan planning was carried out by Müller-Reimann Architekten, who also built most of the buildings. Just three sections were designed by other architects: Grüntuch Ernst Architekten designed the building with the large rounded corners with the slanted supports opposite the commuter rail station, while Weinmiller Architekten designed the building that connects to the south, as well as the section to the east, which also forms the rounded section of the second volume positioned adjacent to the railway lines. The design and construction by Müller-Reimann Architekten also shows a heterogeneous character, the building for the advertising agency Scholz & Friends Is particularly noticeable, with a facade of alternating regular enamelled balustrades and transparent windows. The architects drew inspiration from Classic Modernism, and this can even be seen on the curved glass, that winds around the corner and into the entrance area. With the new headquarters for GASAG (main supplier of gas in Berlin), the same architects revert back to strictly vertical structuring with brick pilaster strips; the choice of brick as material also forges a link to the neighboring commuter railway station. This variety is intended to simulate the aesthetics of older city quarters, although of course here the architectural language is very different and much more modern. This is most obvious when one considers the building section by Grüntuch Ernst Rounded corners can be seen in various places in this quarter, but the slanted concrete columns on this facade are a truly modern feature."

Inside, floor-to-ceiling glass walls connect the two volumes, ensuring that the entire process from administration/planning to production can be experienced by all Artis employees. The ceiling in the large production hall is supported by wooden fish belly girders, which make it possible to avoid the use of supporting columns in the hall. The company specializes in the construction of trade fair stands, exhibitions, and shop construction. This design reflects the high-quality execution and also functions as representative corporate architecture, reflecting the company’s values and expertise. The environmentally friendly planning was also a key focus of the design: the use of materials that are largely C02-neutral (wood and cellulose), the consistent implementation of energy-saving elements with extremely well insulated constructional components, an air-tight building envelope, the use of natural light (achieved in the production hall with a band of windows positioned below the roof), a green roof on the administration building, and photovoltaic panels reduce annual primary energy usage to just 13% when compared to the example buildings from the EnEV (Energy Saving Ordinance) 2009.

The facade is in line with those of the neighboring buildings and the stories are also arranged to correspond to the design of the adjacent houses. However, the facade design also deliberately sets itself apart from the other buildings on the street. Instead of a flat facade finished with plaster, the front of this building comprises matte metal panels broken up and positioned at different angles. The uneven surface changes the character of the light entering the building at different times of the day, ; sometimes bronze-blue and sometimes bronze-red. The angles of the panels j cast shadows, creating an irregular distribution of light and dark areas, this gives the impression that the static support usually offered by the building elements doesn’t apply here. Irregular, shallow balconies with fractured fronts also contribute to the sculptural character of the facade. In terms of style, this design draws inspiration from Prague Cubism, prevalent in the early twentieth century. In Prague, residential buildings were constructed with facetted facades that were set apart from their context. The single-story and split level apartments range from 1,076 to 1,938 square feet and boast room heights of up to 10 feet. The interior design was also partially executed out by Graft (kitchen, bathroom, fireplace). The apartments have larger balconies at the rear of the building and there is also a communal roof terrace, open to all residents."

GmbH initially won the two phase competition to find a design for the Turkish Embassy, but this was then widely derided because of its formal similarities to the German Federal Chancellery (no. 476). As a result, the third place design by Volkmar Nickol and Felipe Schmidt was eventually chosen. Together with Thomas llilllg, they constructed a building that fuses Turkish architectonic heritage with modern aesthetic. This is the largest Turkish construction project to be built outside of Turkey and is designed in accordance with the typical Berlin ideal of a classic perforated facade, although the window openings are more loosely arranged as those on the neighboring Italian Embassy building (no. 258), and the hierarchical structuring of the building stories has also not been adhered to here. The most striking feature of the design is the asymmetric entrance portal, which cuts deep into the building and juts slightly out in front of the building line and above it The entrance is clad with copper plates and the irregular form of these helps to loosen the strict orthogonal character of the building. It is also illuminated at night The entrance portal leads to a glazed passage called the “Bosporus"" that separates the two adjacent building volumes, symbolizing the Bosphorus separating the two parts of Turkey. On one side of this glass passage is the “Palace"" Asia, that serves representative purposes; while the “City”, Europe, Is located on the other side, on Hildebrandstraße, and houses the offices and residential areas. Next to the portal a half-moon and a star are set into the limestone facade, the facade is also perforated with decorative Girih forms. This classic Islamic pattern uses five forms to create abstract starshaped forms. This typical alignment can also be seen inside the embassy on numerous glass surfaces. In this way Turkey has managed to architectonically fuse the Orient with the Occident."

Mayer H.,"This apartment building was built on one of a number of undeveloped plots on Johannisstraße and is based on the idea of the classic Berlin apartment building. However, the sculptural facade sets it apart from other residential buildings in Berlin. Inside, the design takes the form of a town house, with a private garden behind the commercial spaces on the ground floor, classic apartments above and a penthouse on the top floor. The 21 apartments are oriented southwest towards the garden courtyards and an atrium; the building also stretches between these to make the most of the width of the plot. This wing takes the place of the traditional Berlin transept and/or rear building. The sculptural facade comprises stainless steel elements that rise up along the actual aluminum and glass facade and curve gently outwards around the windows giving the building a wavy appearance. In front of the windows, the waves fall into a trough with rounded corners, thus opening up the space for the windows. These lamella can also be seen on the facade facing the garden and form the balustrades for the balconies but without the increasing opulent sculpturality. On this facade, the floor-to-ceiling windows are much more obvious. A large wave rolls along the depth of the site, playfully continuing the facade design along the staggered building levels. The commercial spaces have a more open facade, and the aluminum panels appear almost to flow out to the sides towards the frieze of the neighboring building."

The building has a simple spatial organisation and is clad with 4 larch wood. Inside, the walls are clad with white-painted birch wood. The roof slopes down in the middle, dividing the rooms into areas of different heights. The lower side facing east houses a cupboard, the WC and the kitchen, while the higher rooms are divided horizontally into two by a gallery, and feature large windows that open out towards the garden. The upper levels are reached via a flight of stairs with a railing made from three birch branches. The windows vary in size and establish a connection ^ between the interior and exterior, as well as giving the building a modern, playful appearance. The large wooden terrace optically extends the house towards the garden. A skylight in the sloping roof and a Scandinavian wood-burning stove create a cosy atmosphere and give the house a natural feel."

The existing building shell has been reduced and spatially rearranged with a floor area of 5,800 square feet spread across seven levels. The almost completely closed facade comprises white aluminium panels. Only the doorjamb of the glass sliding door leading into the store is cut deep into the facade and gives a sense of depth. The door is as tall as the building is wide and thus offers views of the space beyond, stretching from the ground floor into the first floor. The upper floors also have windows facing the street but these can be completely closed with shutters that fit flush into the facade, so that just faint outlines are visible. Inside, further voids connect the ground and basement levels and the first and second levels, creating a meandering sequence of spaces that all flow into each other."

The form of the base Is the result of the building's orientation towards three different streets that enclose the triangular site: Kantstraße, Hardenbergstraße and joachlmstaler Straße. The two towers rise above a base that responds to the heights of the neighboring buildings and are fused together, giving them a staggered, interlocking appearance. The name “Zoofenster"" (zoo window) was inspired by the close proximity of the zoo and a seven-story glass facade facing Breitscheidplatz that 4 replaces the natural stone cladding on the highest part of the tower. This natural stone facade has horizontal channels on the building base and opens out with arcades facing Hardenbergstraße. Diverse window formats are arranged in a strict pattern and emphasize the different building volumes. The rather strict appearance is relaxed by the window openings that either project outwards, are set back Into the facade or create loggias. An interesting technical feature of the building is the special glass that is designed to reduce radar reflection, which has been used due to the close proximity of Tegel Airport. The main part of the building houses the Waldorf Astoria hotel, while offices, stores, and restaurants are located on the remaining levels. A cafe can be found on the ground floor and the design is based on that of a former cafe from the 1920s that was once located on the opposite side of the plaza but destroyed during World War II."
Tour Total,Tour Total,The New Berlin: 1989-Present,2012,Heidestraße 73,52.5275913,13.3694958,Barkow Leibinger,"This was the first Europacity building to be constructed on the site of the new main train station. The design has proved to be a real trend-setter thanks to the well thought out combination of functional and aesthetic dynamics. The 223-foot tower was built within a timeframe of just two years, based on plans by the architecture office Barkow Leibinger. The fundamental idea behind the design was to generate diversity by using prefabricated asymmetric modules. In order to do this, eight variations of the so-called K-Model were used and then assembled on the load-bearing structure. This method leaves the construction principle of the building shell visible, but also creates a dynamic facade, which has a different appearance depending on how far away you stand and from what direction you look. This evokes the impression that the building is rotating on its axis. The rooms benefit from the floor-to-ceiling glass facade; positioned between the K-modules, this draws plenty of light into the tower and offers spectacular views, while the concrete used for the expressive facade provides insulation and protection from the sun. The volume bends slightly in order to reduce the solid character of the vertical tower. The two-story tower base hides an inner courtyard, which also functions as a throughway for pedestrians and thus opens the building up to its surroundings. Access to the entrance lobby of the office tower is also via this courtyard. This representative space is the only one in the entire complex where the interior design was also created by Barkow Leibinger. The wall relief in particular demonstrates the architect office’s typical style, comprising ceramic tiles that respond to the sculptural motif of the facade design."

The architecture aims to express these intentions, comprising 34 individually prefabricated freight containers that form a four-story cube. The partially glazed front and the white writing above the entrance make the function of the building clear. An important characteristic of this container building concept, developed by Platoon in collaboration with the architecture office Graft, is its modular structure and the fact that it can be dismantled and then rebuilt. This concept offers the flexibility required by the globalised art and culture scene. Additional freight containers can also be added at will, and there are numerous stacking possibilities, you just need to let your imagination fly. Inside, the vertical corrugated metal walls are a dark military green and the building offers space for various events and exhibitions, as well as workshops, lectures and discussions about the different types of subculture art."

This presented the architects with a challenge - how to optimally serve multiple functions and how to make the best possible use of the available space. The design needed to accommodate laboratories, technical spaces and offices in different combinations that could be rented by small and medium-sized companies. The solution was to Stack the building components behind each other and connect the various elements. The heart of the ensemble is the triangular foyer and trapeze-shaped facade with its embedded rectangular glass front. Photovoltaic test areas on the facade not only provide shade, but also add a decorative element. They also relate to the function of the building, showcasing the expertise of the companies within. Inside, the foyer acts as a communal area that can be used by all tenants, employees and visitors, it also provides glimpses of the upper levels from below. A sculptural, free-standing flight of stairs leads from the foyer to the levels above. On the ground floor, the foyer leads to the adjacent technical hall and the workshops. The offices and laboratories are located in three two-story volumes, positioned in a lateral alignment to the technical hall. Accessible roof gardens are located between these three units."

The detailed glass facade of the almost cubic building comprises three layers that unite thermal glass with translucent mesh in order to optimally regulate light flow. The building responds to the proportions of the old dome, rising above a solid building base. The complex supporting structure is built of extremely precise concrete elements, built by HG Merz Architekten in collaboration with Werner Sobek. Inside, the room is divided into two sections. Wooden book cases are spread over three levels and, combined with the red floor, these create a warm intimate atmosphere. A narrow flight of stairs leads to the upper floor of the volume, which is partially clad with white textile panels. The gallery offers views through the glass facade, which also draws daylight into the space. Both halls feature artwork as part of the Percent for Art scheme.

The tree house in the garden of the Kreativhaus e. V. was designed by Legeer Architekten in collaboration with the institution itself based on drawings created by children from the neighborhood. As a multiple-generation building, Kreativhaus has taken it upon itself to use creative play and theatre to promote art and culture, education and upbringing. The tree house is intended less as a traditional platform positioned In the branches, and more as an asymmetric winding construction that spirals around the trunk and playfully integrates the branches. A facade of wooden panels all positioned at slightly different angles encloses the platform, thus forming a half-closed interior space with a terrace and roof terrace. The railings on the staircases are closed in comparison. The prefabricated segments are arranged flexibly around the building and can be adjusted according to the future growth of the tree, so that the tree and the building can remain as two individual elements."

The original building by James Hobrecht (no. 74) dates back to 1875 and was once an Integral part of Berlin’s sanitation system. After the building became devoid of purpose during the 1970s, It was used as a location for historic stone sculpture during the 1980s. This later use as a sculpture museum is still evident today. In 2009, Berlin art collector Christian Boros bought the building, complete with pumps and sculptures. A concrete object was Integrated in order to generate additional space and functional rooms. This is embedded 39 feet Into the ground and functions as both an architectural object and sculpture. Although the structure of the original building has not been changed, the spatial arrangement has undergone some alterations in order to play with the visual impression of the space. The black concrete that has been used both inside and outside contrasts with the colors of the historical building and makes the new building easily recognizable. Furthermore, light is reflected from the black walls and absorbed by the even darker corners. The new architecture provides space for Boros art publishers and communication agency and also introduces new useable surfaces: projection, niches, pedestals, and balconies create a modern exhibition area."

The building houses his own extensive collection of architectural drawings. The intension of the museum is to use its collection and exhibitions to draw attention to architectural drawings as the artistic root of this increasingly technical profession. The tower-like building is built on a base of 26 by 39 feet and the volume appears to be constructed of a series of stacked boxes: four made of concrete and with slightly bent sides at the bottom of the building (or is it more than four, bent and pushed together?) and a glass box above. Cross-hatches are cut into the concrete surface, but the most prevalent feature is details from drawings by stage designer Pietro di Gotardo Gonzage, whose work was the starting point of Tchoban's collection. The details were enlarged using a CNC milling cutter and engraved on MDF panels before fluid plastic was used to make a mould. The plastic matrixes were embedded into the concrete shell and now form a relief on the concrete surface. The aggregate used in the concrete - pigments and crushed stone - are supposed to give the concrete a paper-like impression. The motif of enlarged sketch details also reappears in the foyer, carved into the hand-carved walnut veneer."

In contrast to the typical town houses of the era, the structure here is obviously inspired by the Classical style. The bay windows and balconies provide a counterpoint to the horizontal structuring, which also forms a balustrade under the windows. The pilaster strips and travertine obviously hark back to earlier architectural predecessors, while inside, the marble, oak parquet and, natural stone are inspired by valuable, historical motifs. The expensive serviced apartments with concierge, club and lounge with fireplace house part-time Berlin residents who want a prestigious and exquisite address. Despite its classical character, the building is extremely modern and without sculptural ornament, which helps to distance it from the older buildings in the neighborhood.

The railway lines divide this local recreation area into the Westpark, of around nine hectares (completed in 2013) and the 17-hectare Ostpark (2011). The area to the south of Yorckstraße has been nicknamed the Flaschenhalspark (Bottleneck Park) because of its shape (2014). A number of leisure areas were also designed in addition to the large park area, in order to provide a variety of spaces to meet varying individual needs. In the Flaschenhalspark in particular, the remains of the former railway were also incorporated into the design. In the Ostpark, the various uses are all arranged around the large Kreuzberger Wiese (Kreuzberger Meadow). A 14,000-square-feet skate park is also located here, as well as a 50-year old grove that has been incorporated in the new design. The Westpark, with the Schöneberger Wiese (Schöneberger Meadow) is intersected by a number of viaducts and forms an axis at its centre, connecting it to the Lutherkirche on Dennewitzplatz.

The 3.2-hectare project involved converting numerous listed historical buildings to offices, apartments, businesses and cultural facilities. David Chipperfidd was responsible for the conversion of the former women’s clinic, and the hospital extension on Ziegelstraße by Walter Wolff (1930-1932), located on the west bank of the Spree. While the transformation of the extension, carried out in the international Style, accommodates apartments, the former women’s clinic buildings were converted and now house the campus of the Telekom’s ""School of Transformation"". These old buildings, built in the neo-Renaissance style - a lecture room and the main building - were built by the leading hospital architects of that era, Martin Gropius and Heino Schmieden 1879-1883. Chipperfield also extended the main building on the Ebertbrücke. The extension has been built in the modern style and replaces the original extension, which was demolished after World War II. The strictly orthogonal building volume is built of yellow-red bricks in different shades. Large rounded arch windows are arranged geometrically and open out the facade - these are the only structural elements, apart from the narrow bands beneath the windows. The height of the windows varies from floor to floor and these are divided into threes reminiscent of ancient Roman window openings in thermal baths. Part of the wall remains fully closed. The interplay between the closed wall surfaces with their solid brick mass and the arched window openings are reminiscent of the imposing antique ruins of thermal baths. The converted historical building has been topped with a new attic story."

A large passage within the block leads from Voßstraße to Leipziger Straße. On the other side, the complex stretches all the way to Wilhelmstraße. The Bundesrat (Federal Assembly) building can also be seen from the passage. The new building replaces the former Wertheim department store (no. 137), which was built in a number of construction phases from 1896 onwards by Alfred Messel. This building was considered to be an incunabulum of German warehouse architecture, because the facade was structured by piers reaching from the ground all the way to the roof, with floor-to-ceiling windows between the piers. This was an entirely new formal language for this type of building. Up until World War II, warehouses were typically flooded with light, it was only after the war that the volumes were almost completely closed in order make the use of artificial light possible. The historical building was partially destroyed by bomb strikes from the Allies and then mostly demolished in 1956; the underground room housing the safes was used as a disco from 1991 to 2005. The large windows are a nod to the design of the historical building, but apart from that anomaly, the building respects the style of the surrounding buildings. The apparent parcelling of the site on Leipziger Straße is intended as a reminder of the construction of the historical building in phases. The passage replaces the atrium once found in the Wertheim department store. A large shopping mall has been built on the site of the former warehouse - a dying breed of architecture - housing independent stores, restaurants, hotels, offices and apartments. An extension carried out in 2015 makes this shopping centre the largest in Germany (320 stores spread across 1,453,000 square feet)."

This new eight-story building has three primarily vertically structured areas: the sides each have three axes, while the middle section has five. The sides have double pilasters without bases or capitals, while the middle sections have rows of triple columns. The central part of the facade also has small balconies in front of the glass doors. This was a typical design feature prevalent in buildings from the 19th century, while the side sections feature recessed windows with balustrades. On the two side sections, the upper floor is separated from those below by a cornice. The entrance areas have a solid and rather imposing appearance and the lines carved into the surface are designed to look as if solid stone has been used - this design feature is also typical of 19th-century design. The middle building section provides access to the courtyard and commercial areas, the structuring of the ground floor Is not a continuance of the structuring on the floors above and almost looks as if it was altered as an afterthought Such inharmonious alterations to historical buildings can be found in Berlin and the failure to harmoniously unite the old with the new was a common problem during the 19th century. Despite its classical proportions, this continues neither the vertical orientation nor the sculptural character of the neighboring buildings. In contrast, the side of the building facing the courtyard is much more sculptural, featuring projecting balconies and recessed loggias. The horizontal bands are offset in depth and this, together with the rounded building elements, is reminiscent of Art Deco."

The Belgian artist Arne Quinze and his architectural office SAQ architects envisaged a reconstruction of the open level, which originally gave the building its nickname. The clearly structured 590-foot long volume was considered to be a “display window of the west’ in its day; a modern symbol to counteract the “wedding cake style’ prevalent on the Stalinallee (see nos. 263, 274, 289, 297). The previously extremely run down building now serves as a shopping centre, although the proportions and impression of the building as a whole have undergone significant alterations. The originally open level, closed as an exhibition area in 1978, was not reinstated as planned. Inside, the building substance has also been altered significantly. The shopping centre is intended as an intercultural Concept Mall. A hotel is located at the rear of the building, and the construction has undergone such dramatic alterations here that it could almost be called retro architecture, rather than a historical remodeling.

The location on the Messedamm was carefully selected to accommodate a large entrance forecourt oriented not only In a southerly direction towards the inner city, but also towards the outskirts of the city, and to give the building a prominent location to suit its function and importance. Reinforced concrete was used for the building base, which also has floor-to-ceiling windows all the way around the ground floor. This draws a wealth of natural light into the building.

A visitors’ centre will ‘democratically’ communicate some of the workings of the agency to the public; however, the rest of the operations taking place within the building remain top secret and are controlled by strict security measures. The ground floor will be as closed as possible, so the architects decided to embed the main volume, located 100 feet away from the street, 16 feet below ground to make it less noticeable.
